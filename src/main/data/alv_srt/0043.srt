1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
here we

2
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:30,370
so we will continue the introductory part on the classification of data mining tasks and

3
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:37,550
and finally on the visualization we will distinguish between two sorts of data mining tasks

4
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:43,820
mainly predictive and descriptive in predictive tasks we are dealing with the same classification problems

5
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,620
and then the approaches which we take his learning sets of rules or decision tree

6
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:59,630
learning when we have one target variable and this target variable would be typically discrete

7
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,690
like reading or not reading are being the readers of the law more being leaders

8
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:10,790
of vichy and france so on we could have a binary classification problem for multiclass

9
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:18,240
classification problem we can also deal with prediction destination tasks and that we would typically

10
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,990
use regression analysis then the data can be in the form of a single table

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,550
or in the form of of a relational database all my multiple relational tables and

12
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:38,050
then we'll in that case we are dealing with so-called predicted relational data mining or

13
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:45,160
inductive logic programming other sorts of tasks where we don't have specified classification variables so

14
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:53,380
we don't want to distinguish between members of different classes would be descriptive tasks like

15
00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:01,780
description and summarisation dependency analysis like association rule learning discovery of properties and constraints segmentation

16
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,330
or clustering as well as subgroup discovery so

17
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,930
if we try to show it almost the picture in the simplest classification problem we

18
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,770
would distinguish between

19
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,710
members of one class versus members of the other class and the classification would be

20
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:25,300
the main the ultimate goal so we'll try to distinguish between populations of one class

21
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,550
and the other one is here with our data is not labelled with the class

22
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,360
but it is non specific variables is the

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,300
class or the target variable and we just interested in finding some properties which hold

24
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,860
on parts of the data we would perhaps want to cluster together the items the

25
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,490
individuals which are most similar to each other and that has to do with the

26
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:54,170
segmentation of clustering we can try to find out

27
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,800
characteristic properties which holds on part of the population we can do dependency analysis like

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,670
association rule learning as we have seen in some of the applications which we have

29
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,930
illustrated before

30
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:12,620
separately we can deal with the text web and image analysis again

31
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:20,480
the tasks can be either predictive of descriptive but then the mechanisms of doing data

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,310
analysis are obviously pretty much different

33
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:32,210
so i have already shown this distinction between predicative and in descriptive and

34
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:39,170
here we are in predictive the main goal is to induce classifiers and we have

35
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,710
classification and prediction task which we want to solve

36
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,210
by inducing the classifiers from the data

37
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,390
classification rule learning decision tree learning we have also support vector machines which is one

38
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,270
of the new

39
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:00,730
newer approaches to classification extremely effective and high quality classifiers can be obtained by support

40
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,910
vector machines then we have artificial neural networks bayesian classifiers and so on so here

41
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,710
we generate a hypothesis out of the data and then we test it

42
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:18,120
and it's similar in statistics you can do so different sources of data analysis in

43
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:27,030
setting what with descriptive induction the task can be different just like discovering interesting regularities

44
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,880
in the data not necessarily inducing classifier

45
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:36,540
discovering patterns here we could use symbolic clustering

46
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,750
association rule learning subgroup discovery and that would be more in the face of exploratory

47
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,020
data analysis is done in with statistical methods

48
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,520
if we take rule learning perspective when we induce rules

49
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:57,890
in predictive induction when we want to induce classifiers we use not looking at individual

50
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,480
but we are using sets of rules

51
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,830
for every

52
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,480
so we want to sets of rules acting as a classifier for solving classification and

53
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,620
prediction task but in descriptive induction we are interested in finding individual rules

54
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,090
we describe a certain interesting property or regularity in the data

55
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:32,640
distinction in terminology and also the types of tasks we are solving is between supervised

56
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,170
and unsupervised learning

57
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:41,320
so supervised learning occurs when there is a specific target variables

58
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,810
representing the class

59
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:49,630
you have patients some patients have a certain diagnoses so different diagnoses would be different

60
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,000
and you would have a certain

61
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,830
and values of that variable would to represent different classes in that case we can

62
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,170
say we are dealing with the supervised learning problem

63
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,910
instances all the training instances are labeled with the class labels

64
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:20,710
and such a setting is used for predictive induction what is supervised learning setting

65
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,210
there we do not have a specific target variable

66
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,780
representing the class

67
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:32,010
no class assignment and this is usually used for descriptive induction we can do descriptive

68
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:38,960
induction also unlabelled data obviously inducing some individual regularities from the data but that would

69
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,670
be the most common

70
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,750
used distinction

71
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:48,130
in subgroup discovery we have labelled data but are using are doing the kind of

72
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,130
descriptive induction tasks so we will talk about that later

73
00:06:52,480 --> 00:07:00,710
so i was skip this and i will show some visualizations

74
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,870
so let's look at the visualization of the data

75
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:11,670
so for instance here you have three variables we do to data is described here

76
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:20,620
is a childhood time of course crystallisation and the time from the past from the

77
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,310
from in

78
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:31,670
there was an keep implant put into the patients patients heap

79
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:38,960
and that these are different data points and then different colours would represent different classes

80
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:45,060
so this is one possible way of visualizing the data this is called the scatterplot

81
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,840
obviously you can see that most data

82
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:55,390
here but then you have some outliers and then can look at this particular data

83
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,790
points and try to understand whether it is

84
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,280
indeed an outlier you whether it represents noise whether there was some typing error in

85
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,870
you the most of what something much more general modelling approach is something that in

86
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:15,910
the end might be rather similar to bayesian networks and graphical models

87
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,160
that was the main difference is that well

88
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:25,760
in when people talk about bayesian networks it's usually the discrete values variables and then

89
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,580
things are really much simpler

90
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,520
always talk about continuous valued variables then they always have culture medium

91
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:37,480
and yes they so so this is this will not

92
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,830
is a sense of those in the framework of bayesian networks doesn't really it's not

93
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,370
it's it's it it's simply a simple in those cases but when you want to

94
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,150
model something like images and you want to model build models which are similar to

95
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,370
this one then things get actually very much more complicated

96
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,350
yes it is

97
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,740
yes in US

98
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:17,300
so they are not independent unconditionally they are independent if only we know

99
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,890
this is given the very

100
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,810
so i use these

101
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:34,470
yes yes this user completely independent so unconditional independence

102
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,740
so we kind of continuing this philosophy of ICA that's somewhere there will be some

103
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:46,500
kind of more-or-less independent sourcing signals of some kind of independent courses for the data

104
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,900
but then they are just mixed up which in many many different ways and then

105
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:58,690
there are some of the other variables that also intervened

106
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,930
OK then well the point is that at the likelihood for this kind of model

107
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,820
is then something very complicated so we need to make approximations and so on but

108
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,550
i'm will not going the details but the point is this is what you get

109
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,910
is then in the end when you estimate topographic ICA for images

110
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,180
so here so we still have a linear decomposition of the data

111
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,550
so which means

112
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:33,610
image patches can be represented as a linear sum of certain basis vectors

113
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:41,280
with certain random coefficients it's just that now these coefficients random missions will be

114
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,140
not independent

115
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,860
and by the because this random coefficients

116
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,580
get on this topographic created we can also order the basis vectors on the same

117
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:57,540
topographic rate because each coefficient corresponds to exactly one node basis vector and space

118
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,630
so this is what we get when we all the basis is to make the

119
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,880
basis vectors

120
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,340
and show them in this in this original topographic reformulation

121
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,400
so as you can well as you can easily see there is some

122
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:21,650
uh-huh this this ordering is not random this seems to be something interesting going on

123
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:27,130
and actually what claim is that we get the same kind of the same kind

124
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,710
of topographical ordering that has been observed in the visual cortex

125
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,290
i'm going to do this but

126
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,290
and that's

127
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:41,940
that's one of the reasons that our explanation basically for why we for well is

128
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,670
an explanation but

129
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,150
well that's that's all

130
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,000
justification of why this model is is in his interest interesting

131
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,190
the main point

132
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,900
the babies

133
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,150
here i have a right

134
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,690
one of the best

135
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,560
it was

136
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:23,840
yes well i just went home in my last sentence i realized that i should

137
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,460
if someone justification for what you before this

138
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,880
this model well for

139
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,860
for these independent subspace analysis

140
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:40,020
the whole point is that this is how you get invariant features that are presumably

141
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,630
better in whatever you want to do something for example pattern recognition because you would

142
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:50,840
get features that are there for example you get this kind of general concluded that

143
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,540
those that do not care about the phrase

144
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,440
all the contour

145
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,500
against just where it is just

146
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,590
you know you're never going to see them again

147
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,460
right just

148
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,270
you're student who signed up to go in this experiment in which you from the

149
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,390
screen in the office the money and

150
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,310
the people still like to do fifty fifty

151
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,840
i i mean this is human nature

152
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,990
but interesting for a game theoretic perspective is in a certain sense i mean this

153
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,210
keep nine give one in that sense you choose are kind of is is

154
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,680
my project i mean at some level

155
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,750
you start thinking that

156
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,610
it's interesting to think about

157
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,430
the people

158
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,290
i mean you know you mean

159
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:51,850
if you think about that so

160
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,620
in fact in a certain sense

161
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,960
i mean that user might be offended right from million dollar might not be worth

162
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,280
to them the dollar not you know nothing but their surprise right

163
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,550
you know

164
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,390
in some sense actually the fear that happening

165
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,010
could potentially help

166
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,350
make further

167
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,360
the more fair

168
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,240
exact OK great great great great great great great great so

169
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:32,010
so this is an interesting thing that happens with non zero sum games like this

170
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,420
OK so

171
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,240
please let me just right this is the matrix

172
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,240
this is the case with four dollars let's say i have it in in o

173
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,060
now so

174
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,640
just kind of right this game is the matrix this hearsay with four dollars is

175
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:53,130
to make the matrix smart can choose to either offer

176
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,190
the player can decide

177
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,780
since it used to do this we can decide how much offer the user you

178
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,710
say one dollar two dollars three dollars we could offer zero but that's

179
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,940
now there's no reason to example could offer for that's not very interesting thing to

180
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,660
do this but there is not getting anything so there is natural things are one

181
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,680
two or three

182
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:17,490
and now that user can decide so what does it mean to have the user

183
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,320
strategy significantly advance the user kind of thinking how much money is going to take

184
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,580
for me to be happy

185
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,120
but you might think OK

186
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,400
one dollar enough to make me happy two dollars and how much is enough for

187
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,950
me to accept right

188
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,930
and then the future kind of user that accepts even with one dollar could be

189
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,400
the kind of user accepts requires two dollars to accept could be the kind of

190
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,370
user there are three dollars to accept then you get this matrix so for example

191
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,860
if the user wants

192
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,220
any nonzero amount then

193
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,510
that's what they're offering one dollar user is that user one and this further get

194
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,450
three offering to xtutux two offering

195
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,860
three three one

196
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,460
if the user was the kindest canny two dollars to be to except that the

197
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,020
weather offers only one that nobody has any money

198
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,280
if your offers to ever because developers three even three one if that user is

199
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,580
the kind of user requires three dollars to be happy then these two options will

200
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,570
give both players zero this option will give the two three and the other one

201
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,100
so we can write the game matrix just like we've been talking about

202
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,120
the interesting thing about this matrix is there a collection of nash equilibrium is not

203
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,780
just one a bunch of nash equilibria and

204
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,210
so i was mentioning in the back

205
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,830
if you are that user in this case one nice thing you might want to

206
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,060
it's say i'm in the right

207
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,720
you know what i'm going to write a little computer program is going to play

208
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,790
for OK and this program is only going to accept if i get three dollars

209
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,970
there despite

210
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,820
OK you right you basically right this little program going to play for you it's

211
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,240
all i can accept if you get three dollars and you leave

212
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,050
that the sweater can not

213
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,470
negotiate with you

214
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,300
all right and now it's letters the alright but are basically like this is that

215
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,240
right i mean we can do it myself three dollars know

216
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,340
it's not necessarily the case was whether really has all the power

217
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,860
it's a funny kind of this is exactly what is being suggested

218
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,990
it's a funny kind of game because

219
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:29,560
with zero sum games we worried that may be committing first part the minimax theorem

220
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,820
says well it doesn't have to hurt in

221
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,560
non zero-sum game sometimes being able to commit first

222
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,800
and really stick to it

223
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,540
can help

224
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,290
so before you even do that you can say with certainty that i write the

225
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,030
instead of there being a small number of growth factor receptors on the cell surface

226
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,240
there are ten or twenty or fifty times more than are normally present on the

227
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,310
cell surface

228
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:05,780
in other words this growth the growth factor receptors are what's called overexpressed

229
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:16,660
and therefore the delicate balance is disrupted because normally let's say

230
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,760
a cell will have on its surface

231
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,040
five hundred EGF receptors

232
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,030
but in many kinds of cancers probably thirty or forty percent of all

233
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:33,680
carcinoma carcinoma are are the two most epithelial tissues you'll find overexpressed EGF receptor

234
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,740
well why is an interesting it interesting for the following reasons

235
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,320
i told you before that the activation of the receptor

236
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:47,380
depends on its league and persuading two receptor subunits to come together and start firing

237
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,810
as we just discussed

238
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,990
but if you now all of a sudden the cell contains large amounts of this

239
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,570
growth factor being expressed of the growth factor receptor being expressed on the surface

240
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,190
ten or a hundred times more than normal

241
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,700
then these growth factor receptors are going to be rather densely packed on the cell

242
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,810
surface and now they may just come together

243
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,820
because they happen to bump into each other very frequently they don't need the growth

244
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,120
factor pull them together just because there's so many of them so those random interactions

245
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,630
randomly bumping together and these two growth factor receptors may just bumping together it and

246
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,620
send signals into the cell

247
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,380
persuading the cell

248
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,890
there's been some kind of growth factors in in the extracellular domain it's been encountered

249
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,720
when in fact all happened is that there are so many of these growth factor

250
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,000
receptors around the constantly bumping into each other and while they collide with one another

251
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,850
they can activate signaling and release

252
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,350
growth stimulate or signals in the cells

253
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,300
there's another kind of alteration of growth factor receptors also seen

254
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:55,500
in many kinds of human tumours for example in in glial blast which is the

255
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,320
brain tumor

256
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,910
and the clear last doma has the following kind of

257
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:07,610
of receptor on the surface it has a truncated forms of the EGF receptor

258
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,910
on the surface

259
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,610
where a lot of the domain is simply not present

260
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,020
so here's the normal EGF receptor

261
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,800
here's the truncated EGF receptors were lot of the extracellular domain which i'm calling the

262
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:29,170
domain is simply been locked up houses and lopped off well there's been a mutation

263
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:35,500
in the gene which has in effect deleting segments encoding the n terminus of the

264
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,530
receptor protein which normally sticks his head out of the cell

265
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,330
and now you have these truncated receptors and such truncated EGF receptors

266
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,690
we are able to fire constitutively

267
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:53,270
constitutively implies that these receptors are able to fire

268
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,540
in a fashion that is no longer regulated by

269
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,610
busy logic signals it so high

270
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:05,820
steady rain so now these receptor molecules these two truncated receptor molecules flood the cell

271
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,550
with gross to military signal and for reasons that aren't really clear to this date

272
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,550
these two

273
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:17,030
these receptors truncated receptor molecules can dive arise they can come together

274
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,680
even if there is no extracellular ligand present even if there's no growth factors in

275
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,640
the extracellular space

276
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,540
and we now realise for example

277
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:32,910
that there are a variety of structurally altered receptors that fire constitutively into a cell

278
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:37,660
in many kinds of human tumours and in each case the cancer cell is deluded

279
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,910
into thinking that some growth factor has been encountered out here when in fact there

280
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,990
is not at all

281
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,350
once again

282
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,330
what we see is the situation

283
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,320
in which the cell

284
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,920
the cancer cell is being deluded into thinking this growth factors present extracellular space none

285
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,850
has been present at all

286
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:04,610
there's been a variety of drugs developed against for example lung cancer

287
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:08,530
and there are a variety of different kinds of of lung cancers one is called

288
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,750
non small cell lung carcinoma we don't have to deal with those subsets of lung

289
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,710
cancer and it turned out

290
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,850
it turned out

291
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,880
the one of these drugs it's called arrests

292
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,750
i had very mixed effects on patients

293
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:33,120
in about ninety percent of these of the class of lung cancers

294
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,760
patients that were treated the drug arrests

295
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:43,610
we use over the last several years had almost no effect on the tumor treating

296
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:49,290
patients continued to to proceed to their deaths it had really had no effect but

297
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,560
in ten percent

298
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,300
in fact there were some random magic responses and the tumors shrunk down

299
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,270
now normally

300
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:01,890
a ten percent response rate would be enough to cause the drug company to abandon

301
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,940
all further development of the drug because it's just too low response and who wants

302
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,250
take a drug with the chances of having a good response as low as ten

303
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,220
percent it's just not a good situation

304
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,060
but then some analysis here in boston one group at the MGH and another over

305
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,050
to dinner farber began to look at the long cancer cells that respond

306
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:29,020
i e from two reservations that responded and triang in response to the drug

307
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,280
and the long and the lung cancer cells in patients who didn't it turns out

308
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,920
that the rest is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kind is of the EGF receptor

309
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,940
that so it was designed

310
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,600
in other words this drug to low molecular weight drug

311
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:50,410
and it goes into the terracing kind is domain that rectangular thing i showed you

312
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:54,900
before very schematically and shuts down the firing of the receptor

313
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,850
that was the motivation behind creating this drug

314
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:05,380
so you rest rest shuts down the EGF receptor and ten percent of lung cancer

315
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,810
patients the tumour shrank

316
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,340
the other ninety percent didn't weren't affected at all

317
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,630
and what these two groups geneticists found over the last three or four months

318
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,270
is it the patients whose tumors responded

319
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,140
had tumor cells where the EGF receptor was mutated

320
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:28,030
and therefore firing in a constitutively active fashion

321
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,170
that is to say

322
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,750
there were actually structural alterations in the receptor

323
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:37,610
this is a massive structural alteration receptor here this truncation but in fact in certain

324
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,650
ten percent of patients

325
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:47,190
the respondent there were much more subtle changes in the cytoplasmic domain of the protein

326
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:55,060
which allow these receptors to constitutively dimerisation once again in the league and independent fashion

327
00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:01,640
so the size limitations mimic in effect the consequences of the leading truncating the extracellular

328
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,600
domain in that in both cases one gets legally independent receptor

329
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:12,740
in those cases where these with the patients head a mutant EGF receptors structure EGF

330
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,740
receptor was fined considerably there were dramatic responses to the rest of drug

331
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,270
you know

332
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,930
the names of each

333
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,100
that you have to satisfy

334
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,020
invisible in

335
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,900
markov model

336
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,940
you have some states

337
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:37,720
so you don't know the names of each word senses in this sentence

338
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,450
it's going to be really

339
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,930
you might not

340
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,100
so the two

341
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,420
might not really worked

342
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:49,930
just leave the interesting information and

343
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,820
as well states

344
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,110
you might stop for the common sense

345
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,650
so there are still

346
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,940
so you don't

347
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,900
well you can not so easy to compute from

348
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,890
the transition which

349
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,380
he is

350
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,220
so that

351
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,610
so is

352
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,330
the probabilities of initial state

353
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,310
the state transitions

354
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,120
and also the problem of

355
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,210
the mission that

356
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,170
this problem is for

357
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,490
so if

358
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,440
you can compute

359
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,900
transition probabilities and conditional probabilities

360
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,630
so the transition of

361
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,220
from going from state to state

362
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,380
you just come out

363
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,350
in your

364
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,900
how many times

365
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:14,610
when he wants to live many times you go to state

366
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:20,160
consider this whole states lines

367
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,000
you also consider the nominator

368
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,470
all the times that you are so just count

369
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,720
how many times

370
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,740
like it

371
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,710
that you will see the line to see line history

372
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,950
and is similar

373
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,580
four of the emission probabilities one see it

374
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,140
you can't how many times you it

375
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,920
a system consisting of four

376
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,720
so is

377
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,980
and then consider all the time is that you

378
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,380
state so

379
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,550
again maximum likelihood estimation

380
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,930
you can compute these

381
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,110
the decision problem is issue

382
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,490
problem is

383
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,400
if you want it

384
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:21,100
it's not for

385
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,330
you need

386
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,730
you need to estimate the actual

387
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,580
so the problem is that

388
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,590
i don't know

389
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,390
the states that the previous examples include

390
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,010
so usually we

391
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,370
but approach

392
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:46,370
so we start with an initial estimate of these

393
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,740
so give me

394
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,240
mean you

395
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,390
what something of is

396
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,820
well some

397
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,220
this is something which is more likely to occur

398
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,410
and then

399
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,290
very hot stars

400
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,180
which produce

401
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,600
white light

402
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,700
why this we can

403
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:05,680
think of it

404
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,310
in the next slide you see that creates

405
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,660
and is immediately obvious that you see blue light coming from the vicinity of those star

406
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,930
there are these very fine dust particles

407
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,210
few microns

408
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,520
and they scatter light new direction from those stars and so the light comes blue

409
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,600
the same reason why are sky blue

410
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,310
the next slide i find even more interesting

411
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,020
as a man walking on the moon

412
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,270
there's no atmosphere on the moon in the sky would look completely dark

413
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,140
absence when x is

414
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,680
but dust

415
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,040
on they on the ground and this aspen out walking on the moon

416
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,160
and therefore some of the dust

417
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,520
thrown out

418
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,310
and its surrounding

419
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,790
the light using

420
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:57,750
they can

421
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,290
by the camera

422
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,200
clearly scattered sunlight

423
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,930
scattered all these very fine dust particles

424
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:05,520
and his group

425
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,850
the same reason why are skies

426
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,890
so you see the really

427
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,180
scattering here

428
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,770
dependence on wavelength

429
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,750
but that's online courses

430
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,040
as white as we call it like

431
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,290
and i want to demonstrate is the u

432
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,940
by creating very fine

433
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,270
dust particles

434
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,240
and those very fine dust particles

435
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,180
will be

436
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,440
dust particles in cigarette smoke

437
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:39,140
the demonstration that i don't like because they have too small

438
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,950
the center all the way there

439
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,790
bright white light coming up vertically and the reason why we let it comes straight up

440
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:54,910
and here

441
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,480
i'll put

442
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,570
smoking cigarettes

443
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,390
and whatever comes to u

444
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,080
no matter where you are

445
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,830
always comes out roughly ninety degrees

446
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,280
that's why i get the double bonds for this thing

447
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:15,600
and in addition the particles are fine but only if they are very small few microns they will be blue

448
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,430
the smoke will be blown

449
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,490
and since you have a linear polarizer s

450
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,570
we should be able to see what you rotate it

451
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,070
the light is polarized anyway

452
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,110
in this plane at ninety degree angles

453
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,610
which is this whole horizontal plane or during this horizontal plane more or less doesn't

454
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,940
matter is sitting there with there

455
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,280
you should see the light

456
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,850
pretty much polarized

457
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,320
all right

458
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,570
sitting here in this election

459
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,780
all right here

460
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:44,940
all right here

461
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,070
so first

462
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:47,990
try to

463
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,940
create is very fine dust particles

464
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,140
by simply

465
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:55,990
having some

466
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,900
smoking of cigarettes in there being there

467
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,860
like beam make it very dark when we get to it

468
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,290
and i have to

469
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:10,840
can we just like check that for a moment so I believe that that this

470
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,240
is the this is 3

471
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,380
doesn't look right

472
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:34,960
and see what you want to know what devices we wanna find a pattern

473
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,530
and and actually where this 1 is I wrote that 1 down 1st because it's

474
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:45,550
uh because the pattern will be easier to find 43

475
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,880
somehow see it's already works OK now I have to ask you how you checked

476
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:00,480
it and how did you do that matrix multiplication you probably did roles

477
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,070
here times columns there

478
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,010
all right fair enough

479
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,290
actually here is that you can just make a comment on that it's well worth

480
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,760
looking because it's terrific to have actual numbers

481
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:20,410
OK what I see what I mean the crucial thing in these all these matrices

482
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,460
is pattern minus 1 2 0 minus 1

483
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,440
and we're going to recognize that as as a kind of 2nd difference

484
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,100
so I'm not surprised if I take it away I notice about that column is

485
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,360
that it's like linear 3 to 1

486
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:40,270
and then if I take a 2nd difference of a linear thing I expect to

487
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:45,460
get 0 just loses take that I do minus 3 plus or minus 1

488
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,960
and if aware that role by this 1 well of course it's linear it's even

489
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,190
constant so I get minus 1 plus 2 minus 1 and getting 0 and then

490
00:33:55,210 --> 00:34:00,600
of course I should check that I got the diagonal right minus to plus or

491
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:07,140
minus 1 right that at least 1 OK so that is the inverse

492
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:16,550
and we could yes OK so match mathematics is often wondered I think it would

493
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:23,310
be fun to see if we can find the inverses here and uh

494
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:30,410
by a mixture of guesswork and then maybe understanding sort of inspired decimation

495
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,690
and in the y

496
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,740
now can move to the inverse

497
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:45,220
with question mark of this of this 1 this 1

498
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,550
what about was

499
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:52,380
I wrote down the word nonsingular because you told me to

500
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,500
but now

501
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,910
I'm not so sure about this 1

502
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,650
I believe what you think of

503
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,960
the rows and 0 right

504
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,690
so that's suspicious

505
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,480
In fact that should actually tell us that is not invertible right and what's a

506
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,390
good way to to recognize the matrix is invertible well you could say take is

507
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:28,380
but don't say that the the matter of Matlab will take its determinant and and

508
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,570
you for 3 by course we could do it but it's a much better

509
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,810
like recognized of vectors

510
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,740
that it takes to 0 if I if we can find a vector that that

511
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,100
it takes to 0

512
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:53,140
so what so what what I'm going to show is being 3 is is singular

513
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,770
so that with with both of these

514
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,570
both the 1st row last row altered

515
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:15,010
that brings the matrix down those matrices are will see positive definite this 1 is

516
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:22,070
dragged down to being only as we'll see positive semi de OK what's the

517
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,760
that's that's not out by being

518
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:36,030
all ones right constant vector right and that's exactly because as you said when the

519
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,910
when the role when the rows that is 0

520
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:44,700
then why multiplied by all ones then I'm adding that what I'm doing is adding

521
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,870
up each row and getting all zeros and you see that we have now demonstrated

522
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,270
that the matrix is singular

523
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:56,770
it's it has to be a singular matrix effects taking some vector 0

524
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:01,850
it couldn't have an inverse if we have a solution we have waited for this

525
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,960
be 3 we found a vector X so that

526
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,660
is completely knocked out

527
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,810
OK now if there was an inverse

528
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,050
we could multiply that equation

529
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,760
that inverse

530
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,330
and what what we learn

531
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,220
we learn is

532
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:25,420
so it from ever matrix and part not square matrices here if it has a

533
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,590
only vector

534
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:36,270
X that would solve this equation would be the 0 vector

535
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,570
and that's the case for those 2 but here we have an x not

536
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:47,520
that solves the equation so we know there's a there's the vectors X not connected

537
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:55,160
just repeat that argument from this if there is an inverse I can multiply by

538
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,420
and I would learn X was 0

539
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,570
so so having an inverse means not only solution

540
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:09,720
so in these cases which still have inverse the only solution to t 3 x

541
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,830
equals 0 is that it is the 0 vector but here we have other solutions

542
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,960
in fact while we're at it

543
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:20,960
more solution to be 3 x equals 0 to tell me the whole

544
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:28,090
the null space of this matrix so this this xxx adjusting use that word this

545
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:38,110
X is in the null space meaning just what it says of 3 OK and

546
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,030
tell me another exits in the null space

547
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:45,260
yeah any constant times 3 3 3

548
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,190
or 6 6 6

549
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:53,270
and in fact that's the whole null space the the null space is any multiple

550
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:56,460
of that particular vector X

551
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,380
and that

552
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,850
that the null space is that line

553
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:05,180
of OK what 1 other point is actually an important point is just 1 over

554
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,570
degree matrices

555
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:13,380
how do I multiply a matrix by by a vector weatherwise what see going on

556
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,500
I like to multiplied

557
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:23,920
like columns a column time so I see this as the multiplication of matrix by

558
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,030
vectors as I think of it as 1 times the 1st column

559
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,110
keep slides from

560
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,050
now the answer that's true

561
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,340
can you it's not mathematical sequence

562
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:42,490
this is a real life sequence

563
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,500
in city

564
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,400
new york was the seventh avenue line

565
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,170
in new york city is the my favourite somewhere in new york

566
00:39:54,190 --> 00:40:00,510
what's called feature of the new york city subway

567
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,480
is the skip list can answer

568
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,950
indeed it is

569
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,540
so if you want to experience skip lists some practical

570
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,780
they have been implemented

571
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,440
in the subway system

572
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,090
cause that

573
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:23,580
boston subway is pretty cool because it's the oldest subway

574
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,340
definitely in the united states navy in the world

575
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,040
new york is close

576
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,520
it has other nice features like it's open twenty four hours after it has no

577
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,670
a plus but it also has this feature express lines

578
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,430
it's a bit of an abstraction by the seventh everyone has

579
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,390
essentially two kinds of cars

580
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,260
there is that these are street and by the way this is know

581
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,140
penn station in times square

582
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,600
and so on

583
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:57,230
there are essentially two lines there's the express line which goes fourteen thirty four forty

584
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,470
two seventy two to nineteen six

585
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,240
and then there's the local line which takes which stops at every cell

586
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,800
and they have they accomplished this with four sets of tracks

587
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,220
the express lines have their own dedicated track if you want to go stop fifty

588
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,410
nine from the same penn station

589
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,120
well i would say from from

590
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,420
lower west side you take

591
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,920
you get on the express language up to forty two pretty quickly and then you

592
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,310
get good switch over to the local i'm and going to

593
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,780
fifty nine or reverse

594
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,900
i was going

595
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,370
so this is

596
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:35,950
and local lines and we can represent that

597
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,110
with a couple of lists we have

598
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,490
one last

599
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,830
we have

600
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,400
one list on the bottom

601
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,470
so we some space appear

602
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,900
this is the local

603
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,480
quite well too

604
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,260
thirty four

605
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,060
forty six two

606
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,600
you know i

607
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,830
sixty six

608
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:11,000
seventy two

609
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:15,910
seventy nine and so on

610
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:20,450
and then we have the express line on top

611
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,950
only stops at fourteen

612
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,240
thirty four

613
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,750
forty two

614
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,360
seventy two and so on

615
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:35,610
not going to redraw the whole list

616
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,790
you get the idea

617
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,590
so what we're going to do is put links between

618
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,660
the local and express lines

619
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,380
wherever they happen to meet

620
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,360
that's are

621
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,760
to link to link structure

622
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,420
so that's what i actually meant

623
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,510
when i was trying to draw some pictures now this has the property that in

624
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,350
one list the bottomless every element occurs

625
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:04,020
in the top was just copy some of those elements and we're going to

626
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:05,150
preserve that

627
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,290
so l two

628
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,630
stores all the elements

629
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:19,630
and l one store some subset

630
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,530
and it's still open which ones we should store

631
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:27,830
that's the one thing we need to think about inspiration

632
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,370
from the new york subway system

633
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,670
because there

634
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,100
that's the idea of course we're also going to use more than two lists

635
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,560
we also have links

636
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:45,760
the same links between the school fees

637
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:54,750
in l one and l two

638
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,450
so just for the sake of completeness and because only this later let's talk about

639
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:08,470
searches before we worry about how these lists are actually constructed

640
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:16,070
one four

641
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:20,570
so if you want to search for an element x

642
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,890
what do you do

643
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,650
well this is the taking the subway algorithm

644
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:31,160
and suppose you always start in the upper left corner of the subway system

645
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,680
you're always and

646
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:37,940
lower west side of fourteenth street and know exactly what that is

647
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,590
four less somewhere down the of

648
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:47,330
if you want to go to a particular station like fifty nine well used standard

649
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,300
express line as long as you can

650
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:55,900
OK thank you

651
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:03,900
so today i will talk about support vector machines so this is the a specific

652
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,050
classification and regression method

653
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,840
so so i'm getting to some details about his methods

654
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:19,290
so the plan is likely so we have several topics so i'm hoping to

655
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,520
OK so for the first part

656
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,930
we have to finish the first two

657
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,960
so the basic concepts and those go

658
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:31,570
to derive the SVM primal and dual problems

659
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:37,830
then for the second part i will talk about training in linear nonlinear support vector

660
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:43,870
then i was partially issue of parameter and kernel selection

661
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,020
and also some practical issues

662
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:52,320
and those mentions some possible research using support vector machines

663
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,710
with some of

664
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,130
some of those issues will be left to a certain part then we also mention

665
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,890
multiclass classification and then have some discussion

666
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:10,290
so please feel free to interrupt me if you have any questions

667
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:18,530
OK so maybe the question is why we are here to talk about support vector

668
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:26,180
this right now it is one of the very popular classes

669
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,270
so in quite a few situations you can give you a competitive performance we use

670
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:36,280
existing classification methods we're not claiming it is

671
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:44,410
it is that where you in my view not mutually reasonably good learning about using

672
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:52,510
such images well would say it is relatively easy to use

673
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,810
well i have to say only relatively well don't come to what i can use

674
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:02,190
that of course in public spending in in this case you want to try k

675
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:10,000
nearest neighbour just like consensus among monday but compared to some very sophisticated classification techniques

676
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,380
where it is the as is is not so difficult to use

677
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,540
so i see there may be one reason why

678
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:24,510
it is possible write this you the visual kernel

679
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:25,870
kernel technique

680
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:32,480
so we have a whole canaries bigger area so next week singer alex smola is

681
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,400
going to give tutorial

682
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:37,080
kernel techniques

683
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:42,450
so there are many extensions so as own is only a kind of kernel methods

684
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:50,620
so let's talk about two class classification first

685
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:56,480
so i was thinking about very simple situation so this is something that there is

686
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:03,120
no training services so we x i i don't want to have

687
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,850
so that the

688
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,000
and you can in euclidean space

689
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:12,450
and each feature vector is the so-called feature vectors

690
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:20,940
so for example you representing each patient as feature vector human components like height weight

691
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,950
blood pressure et cetera so you have get along the

692
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,860
so beautiful such that we weekly denying states

693
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:35,930
now we consider a similar situation we saw only two classes of data

694
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,940
with same properties you're they come in many many cases for example you can read

695
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:44,950
ten digit recognition then you're going to have ten classes

696
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,580
but not before

697
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,220
what is it starts from

698
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:56,690
dealing with the case of progress is only so far

699
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,940
easier description we define an indicator vector

700
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:07,250
so these lies we slept with remember is the number of training instances

701
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:14,240
so this is a component of y is has value to plus or minus one

702
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:19,550
so here that lies training says is in the first place

703
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:24,950
then we say what is class one but if x is in the second is

704
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,180
that we define

705
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,610
the minus one so actually we define this one and it

706
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:35,050
it plays a role in the data vector

707
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:41,860
then the basic idea of support vector machines is to find a so-called separating hyperplane

708
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:44,160
well just like

709
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:52,230
this figure shows so focuses of training instances some circles in the summer triangle

710
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,580
so if he tries to find

711
00:49:54,670 --> 00:50:02,660
separating hyperplane because separate all the training instances when the two dimensional situation that this

712
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:07,540
is just a straight line but in in higher dimensional space we call it a

713
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:13,880
so what we intend to find is this started online so once we have started

714
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,540
to line then we have a model to do prediction

715
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,460
the reason is

716
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:23,500
so if use it is that light as your model then for any new data

717
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,830
there's also services which is on top of it and help users to

718
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,620
find interesting information

719
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,400
so what those services are well there's search

720
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:38,450
anne there's user recommendation and various other forms a recommendation

721
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,200
which help people to understand what is going on

722
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:43,450
so to the extent

723
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,640
machine learning is relevant to query is relevant and helping

724
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,510
to help users to find relevant stuff

725
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:53,280
it's not

726
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:57,620
the only way do so but there's so it can be actually quite useful

727
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:03,230
so take a look at the problems which i so

728
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:05,700
with machine learning and otherwise

729
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,810
one of such problems search

730
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,950
all the relevance in search

731
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,950
some people come to certain clare their search for a number of things one of

732
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:20,450
such things as users so people will find other users users could be celebrities

733
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,370
could be bloggers people already know from somewhere else

734
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:25,940
so really find

735
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:28,850
another thing could be events

736
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,050
so i know something is happening

737
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,860
i want to come here and find out what is going on

738
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:38,260
but this particular event maybe this election happening maybe there's earthquake may be something else

739
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,740
the people of two minds about this so one is show me the freshest stuff

740
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,240
about this thing whatever there is

741
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,310
even it's noisy so the typical and before hatchbacks

742
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,190
gave interesting of

743
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:57,230
and another way to look at edits like i really want to find it

744
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,120
relevant information about a particular event

745
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,410
so i want to

746
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,620
find out about occupy wall st movement but not

747
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:08,300
because blow-by-blow accounts of what everybody's doing that maybe

748
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,240
just the things that more informative people

749
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:14,880
i have said about this event in the recent past

750
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:19,390
so those things are not necessarily in six class which however

751
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,750
the trick is that the so the rose bowl in real time search

752
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:27,280
which really is an open question right now in the research community have the so that's

753
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,020
the second problem

754
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,780
is how to grow the tree graph

755
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,760
so as you probably know

756
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,430
the way to receive information into areas before other people

757
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:42,940
so i can follow other people for a variety of reasons

758
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,560
this could be our friends and family colleagues co-workers

759
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:50,220
so and so forth but also could be medial sources

760
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:52,710
could be influential bloggers

761
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:54,900
could be government agencies

762
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:01,740
so forth so it could be a vast variety of reasons why should be following somebody

763
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:07,380
end on top of this is also the time scale the interest i could be

764
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,580
interesting somebody for a very short time

765
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,900
so the figured out with budget

766
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:16,850
and they

767
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:18,910
thirty recommendation problem

768
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:21,730
is the problem of called the recommendation so

769
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,390
yes i can be following other users but

770
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,910
do not necessarily guaranteed to provide useful information

771
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,010
which i can be finding interesting

772
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,640
so for example news stories

773
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:37,940
medium videos school pictures also for something that could be happening

774
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,540
it right now which

775
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,000
could be interesting to me

776
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:44,920
how do actually figure out what the show to what to who

777
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,150
and there's a bachelor problems

778
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:50,250
so this

779
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,450
how they the trending topics

780
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:54,190
how they should take language

781
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,420
how the antispam and similar

782
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:02,750
how to optimize revenue optimize graph and so on and so forth so like a myriad of problems

783
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:09,400
and these for some other machine learning can or is playing a crucial component

784
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,360
so you can see from those

785
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:19,630
examples the problems which i self can be cast more or less as recommenda style problems

786
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:21,400
which i recommend

787
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,140
items to people

788
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,610
asked people

789
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,130
so she does i recommend there's still problems

790
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:39,160
they can be solved partially for solving second-order problems such such as classification and clustering

791
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,080
so surpassing machine learning problems

792
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,580
so is this really big data

793
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:48,710
so if you do the math

794
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,600
you think that go welfare and fifty million tweets per day

795
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,200
it is multiplied by the size of the tweet

796
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:57,670
so you could probably fit new laptop

797
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,250
early on ebay

798
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:01,880
but then

799
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:06,650
if you actually combine all they associated medium which come with those three

800
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:13,120
andy clickstream of all those events that could be happening whilst on this the graph

801
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,070
and so on and so forth

802
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:15,510
it becomes

803
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,780
so just give one interesting numbers so

804
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,780
so injustice file log data are

805
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,130
just about

806
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:25,840
ten terrabytes per day

807
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,820
and then other things like one

808
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,790
the idea is if you say well if you knew

809
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:35,650
center the process data in the long term

810
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,310
that's really big date

811
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:42,280
now what the challenges

812
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,080
i mean there's many challenges is name a few

813
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,750
after is very rational

814
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:51,420
over seventy percent of all users actually

815
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,690
are outside the us

816
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:57,990
and doesn't mention before through real time

817
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:05,660
this is very important so people comfort wear and really expect things be relevant whatever is happening right now

818
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:07,300
and that's the key

819
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:09,750
because the brevity

820
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,430
the tweets are very short

821
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,240
you know the showed a search query

822
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,180
by the really short and sometimes very noisy

823
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:20,650
so having said about

824
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:23,000
got the question is

825
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,550
the fact that you create

826
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:33,450
some general statement from particular observations and that's also what

827
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:39,990
creating the series is about so learning and creating serie are the same thing so

828
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:44,200
how can we talk about learning theory is we have to make a theory about

829
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,560
making series so it's kind of a circular process here

830
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:54,940
and that's why it's so i think it's an interesting topic because it's really

831
00:56:54,950 --> 00:57:00,770
the fundamental issues it like this because the process of learning underlies

832
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:07,260
most of the sciences at least for example physics

833
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:09,770
most of physics is

834
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:12,840
building series so once we know

835
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,930
how to be series then we can do physics you know

836
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:20,170
so studying learning series good is it can be helpful for studying physics

837
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,550
you know it

838
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:29,670
OK so this is a rephrasing of what they just say in that induction is

839
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:33,490
the process of building theories learning series main focus is

840
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,610
induction which is also

841
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,000
building series

842
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:39,260
how can we do it

843
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,000
so there are of course

844
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,970
we can talk hires about this topic because

845
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:49,360
there are lots of his philosophical issues regarding whether this is possible at all

846
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,300
whether this makes sense

847
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:58,430
and i will try not to go too much into this philosophical issues but give

848
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:01,910
you some some ideas

849
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,180
now what the y

850
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,460
what we do that why would we do

851
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:10,100
sorry would we study

852
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:14,160
learning serie OK this is kind of a joke

853
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:17,060
i'm not saying this is the justification for doing it is

854
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,570
just a like this quote

855
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,760
but the real motivation is here

856
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:26,610
we want to understand systems that

857
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,870
learned from data

858
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:33,280
we want to understand why hardly algorithm that we have been studying in this

859
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:38,320
in this place here for example in the last week or so why do they

860
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,980
work at all and when with a work when we did not work

861
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,470
provide a framework for studying their properties

862
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,820
being able to

863
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:56,550
formerly prediction so once we have created the series as i said before serie is

864
00:58:56,550 --> 00:59:00,390
a model that you can use to make predictions and in this context it means

865
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:02,820
prediction in here means

866
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:05,570
being able to tell that

867
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,540
such an algorithm should be good

868
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:10,210
in such a context or not

869
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,600
of course

870
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:18,950
the ultimate goal is to help design better organisms

871
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,590
OK so

872
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,660
coming back to this distinction between induction and deduction

873
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,040
there is a fundamental difference which is that

874
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,440
deduction somehow

875
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:36,650
there is no argument about whether it's fine not to deduction because once we have

876
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,140
agreed on the rules you just apply the rules

877
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:43,220
four induction is completely different and you can argue

878
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:46,260
powers and actually you can't really justify

879
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,480
or what induction does

880
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,800
because justifying induction means you have to say

881
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:56,600
these actions are correct are these actions are true

882
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:58,080
and actions

883
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:01,820
they don't have to be true of all wrong they are there because you decide

884
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:03,440
out there

885
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,610
right so

886
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,330
unfortunately there is no

887
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:13,740
real justification for induction so we i will not give you prove that such that

888
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,150
some learning algorithm is good or not

889
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:18,490
because that's not possible

890
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:24,200
so we'll see what's can be proven and what kind of people

891
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,830
so previous some examples

892
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:28,820
here is

893
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,930
very classical example

894
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:34,280
say you observe every morning you

895
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,550
you wake up and he observed that the sun

896
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:41,070
rising and someone ask the question so how

897
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:46,280
how likely is it that you think that the sun will rise again tomorrow

898
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,500
he observed

899
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,300
the sun rising every day for

900
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,850
the days for the blind

901
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:57,880
you want to predict how likely it it is that the sun will rise again

902
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,740
so there can be plenty of different answers to that question and here are a

903
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:09,160
one and so would be well i cannot say anything because tomorrow is not like

904
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,450
so why should i be able to predict something for new they which is not

905
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:15,360
the same as

906
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,070
one that i have the ones that i have all served

907
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,500
that's a bit pessimistic

908
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,650
the optimistic

909
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:30,080
statement would be to say well it's always rise so why wouldn't we did not

910
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,930
rise tomorrow so probability is one

911
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,990
and actually anything in between zero and one or

912
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:40,040
not not three playing in one is fine

913
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:43,330
it's annoying

914
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:46,790
do not to do

915
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:51,050
but maybe it's because it does something new

916
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,910
he wants me to install new software

917
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:59,190
which is to break the feedback between the overall cells

918
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:02,100
activity which is the electric potential

919
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:07,320
and the protein mechanisms are opening and closing the generate electric current

920
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:08,660
and if you do that

921
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:13,250
it's familiar course to physiologist is the voltage clamp experiment in which you hold the

922
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:17,340
voltage constant you can do that experimentally we can do it in the model and

923
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,740
if you do that in the model

924
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:23,100
what you find is that all oscillations disappear

925
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:26,230
there is no molecular drive

926
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,150
of the oscillator it is an emergent property

927
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:34,610
or systems level property if you prefer that occurs at the level of the cell

928
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:40,740
below a certain level the property simply doesn't exist and that's why it's incorrect

929
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,970
to label

930
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,280
particular channel proteins as the pacemaker current has some people do

931
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,620
all the pacemaker genes as others do

932
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,870
it depends on

933
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,750
understanding the way in which forty or fifty

934
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:59,220
protein components interact

935
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:03,690
to produce the reason incidentally for the mathematicians here we can show

936
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:07,970
also this is indeed a limit cycle there's no stable point in the middle of

937
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:11,160
it if you put back back

938
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:14,960
voltage oscillations reappear

939
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,810
that that's the limit cycle my heart is

940
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:24,030
beating a bit faster than usual because i'm giving a lecture to

941
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:28,580
and we know the reason that caused reminisce coursing through my system

942
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,640
we know what german dance

943
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:31,720
and to the

944
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,880
pacemaker cells of the heart

945
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:40,360
it up regulates all of these three transporters and if we put that information into

946
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,420
the model

947
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,180
we get

948
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:48,180
a very neat reconstruction of kartik acceleration over them as result of the upregulation of

949
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:52,400
all three of these components it does other things as well but those three are

950
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:58,060
enough to explain acceleration once again this is an integrative property of the whole system

951
01:03:58,070 --> 01:03:59,960
there is no single

952
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:07,720
mechanism that is responsible for that acceleration you understand it by analyzing the complex interactions

953
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,610
between all of the components

954
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:17,090
right this leads me on my third principle i must accelerate a little bit fun

955
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:20,940
going to get through my ten commandments by the time rate for coffee

956
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,920
we have a little bit faster

957
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,560
and the third principal DNA is not so much

958
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:30,490
transmitter of inheritance of already referred to the fact that of course we inherit complete

959
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:32,890
xl but much more than that

960
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:35,320
the DNA is itself marked

961
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:42,610
this methylation histone marking and there may be many other processes that we don't yet

962
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:48,620
fully understand it's worth reading jane choose it'll beautiful article in nature

963
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:50,770
or if you want much more

964
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:56,990
a systematic analysis of the possibilities in relation to the genetics the book by

965
01:04:57,010 --> 01:05:00,830
jablonka and lamb is worth reading too

966
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,650
in fact we should

967
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:08,270
in the usual question the question of landmark markets in other words the inheritance of

968
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:14,920
acquired characteristics we should ask the question what normally prevents that from happening because is

969
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,850
rampant in your body and mind

970
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:22,980
just think of this as an obvious point is worth underlining all the cells of

971
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:26,090
the body have exactly the same gene

972
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:27,420
heart cells

973
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:28,660
the cell

974
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:32,800
but in cells pancreatic cells totally different

975
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:35,750
and the daughter cells from those cells

976
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:38,120
inherit that difference

977
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:42,100
what is the difference it is the gene expression pattern which is imposed on the

978
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,190
genome by itself through

979
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,420
at least partly

980
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:51,830
through epigenetic marking we should be asking the question therefore what prevents that from happening

981
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:56,200
through the german lines i try my book to give an analysis of this is

982
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:59,620
getting choose beautiful article nature

983
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:03,750
instead she chose the title unfinished symphony before my

984
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:08,230
book the music of life appeared so we got on to the concept of the

985
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:11,450
uses music as a metaphore independently

986
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:15,030
although is just simply from our article

987
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:18,370
straight into the components of

988
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:22,640
epigenetic marking the time referred to

989
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:26,240
i couldn't help

990
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,920
picking this

991
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:34,360
headline out from the the guardian motherly love maybe email to genes for the better

992
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:36,570
this is serious scientific study

993
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:40,680
if you want a reference for it is in the journal of neuroscience i could

994
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:43,970
just one example to show you

995
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:47,550
the landmark is some is back in action

996
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:52,320
you know just as an aside if a picture is i will be doing some

997
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:57,320
time later this month in paris and i refer to that mark i'm crazy here

998
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,360
if i lecture in britain

999
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:05,800
and start to suggest that the mark wasn't as wrong as people have explained to

1000
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:09,410
be need to get my head cut off

1001
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:15,330
this is a very good example of how the genetic markers can be used

1002
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:18,120
to get over the difficulty

1003
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:20,180
which most of the

1004
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:24,420
defenders of the central dogma or rather the extension of the central dogma which is

1005
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:30,410
incorrect i would go for which is the the genetic marker is wiped off

1006
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,050
at each other

1007
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:34,890
so level

1008
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:39,200
this is an example of how it can be how that can be circumvented because

1009
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,460
what happens here

1010
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,050
is that the red

1011
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,460
the mother as they are

1012
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,600
there's a lot of course in the headline

1013
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:52,360
and through that activity

1014
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:56,180
marking the gene in the cells of the hippocampus

1015
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:03,220
has the result that those young men they grow up tend to stress

1016
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:04,850
there you are

1017
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:11,080
so they marked the gene even if the gene and is inherited unmarked therefore

1018
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:19,330
characteristic gets transmitted down the generations that only one of the mechanisms by which the

1019
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:24,350
the central dogma of biology can be circumvented and which a form of landmark is

1020
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:26,570
and can come back

1021
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:32,370
four principle i call this the theory of biological relativity because i think it's important

1022
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:39,510
to recognise that in systems that have feedbacks between multiple levels all the way from

1023
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:45,420
the organisms whole down to the gene itself there is simply no privileged level of

1024
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:50,590
as i showed that analysis of pacemaker with them in the heart you have to

1025
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:57,270
take account of in that case cellular protein and gene levels in order to understand

1026
01:08:57,270 --> 01:09:01,000
what is going on that has also major consequences for

1027
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:05,320
the theory of biology means natural selection must be multi level

1028
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:11,690
i go for stephen jay gould therefore rather than richard dawkins and incidentally the levels

1029
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:17,650
is there no longer

1030
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:15,800
they are also

1031
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:38,350
it's not

1032
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:43,470
they are

1033
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:26,580
this like

1034
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:44,820
all of them

1035
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:44,320
you are

1036
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:54,940
he e

1037
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:02,570
went through

1038
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:04,690
the 7

1039
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,640
but that

1040
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:14,040
happy feeling won't last very long because is the way from the season minute nineties

1041
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:19,250
switch to come to believe I'm paying out 7 hours which row 1

1042
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:20,780
so that switches to

1043
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:22,870
all right and

1044
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:28,510
are notices OK on row 1 up its own column wants to see which which

1045
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:34,690
the column 1 not payoffs 7 then are would go back to Rho 1 and

1046
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:36,200
pick the 4

1047
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:38,320
and then at some

1048
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:43,480
and then he would then see would go back to wrote to problem to be

1049
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,310
paying off to an end

1050
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:47,980
it would go on right

1051
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:54,010
so here were really at the critical moment in this lecture right away

1052
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:59,640
you what

1053
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:03,890
what could be an optimal strategy here what do of course I'm not asking for

1054
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:10,840
the optimal strategy precise answer but but you've got to have some

1055
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:19,330
some randomization yet weighted dice that's exactly right each each player ends up in this

1056
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:23,240
system as we take a case where the numbers a little

1057
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:26,000
the like this which would be the typical case

1058
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:28,290
then there

1059
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:34,410
what the the best strategy is you just you you cannot tell another person that

1060
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:37,690
you can't give that person any information about a particular

1061
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:42,330
particular play of the game

1062
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:46,760
but if you pass up information about particular play of the game

1063
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:48,650
the upon it will use

1064
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:52,790
so the best you can do is

1065
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:58,530
you can do it in front of your opponent is flip a coin weighted point

1066
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:05,170
so that so that are will choose these in proportions X and one minus X

1067
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:09,480
so are choice amounts of selecting the fraction x

1068
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:15,270
of the time of the number of places that that you choose row 1

1069
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:18,240
and the remaining fractions wrote to but

1070
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:21,870
randomly and see similarly

1071
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:26,490
has randomized

1072
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,860
paid a price

1073
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,880
so well choose some

1074
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:39,360
X and Y are between 0 and 1 so that was some fraction like a

1075
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:44,280
3rd and two-thirds of the time I don't know right this is some fraction like

1076
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:49,390
to fearsome three-fifths of the time well it doesn't sound right that would come to

1077
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,190
7 quite a lot so

1078
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:55,990
anyway that that's the idea is

1079
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,950
so the best strategy is

1080
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:04,100
are what I would call mixed strategy

1081
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:09,010
next meeting you mix up

1082
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:13,650
the number of rows and that the choices you your choices in a random way

1083
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:18,760
and of course I don't know I mean every poker player with that's just think

1084
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,580
about other games for the moment

1085
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:31,380
if we think of poker doesn't affect the way you would do poker or blackjack

1086
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:34,580
or what your favorite

1087
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,490
game would be

1088
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:43,090
In poker Qualisys takeover well so there are many many more strategies the trouble with

1089
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:49,130
is five squared of the potentional is five to the four you see that five to the fourth

1090
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:58,570
models of inflation are solid at ruled out at about ninety-five per cent confidence limit and the

1091
01:20:58,570 --> 01:21:05,170
value of this in the model depends upon the number of e folds of inflation which are

1092
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:15,620
uncertain five squared models of inflation are still consistent with observations so you do get information on five squared and

1093
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:25,290
five to the fourth model now in terms of the value of r that`s allowed

1094
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:34,550
by the observations first of all lets zero in on the n close to one region and r

1095
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:43,070
small region and look at various predictions of models of inflation exponential models of inflation

1096
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:51,650
power models of inflation linear models of inflation logarithmic models and negative

1097
01:21:51,700 --> 01:22:03,050
and small-field models of inflation and you see at n equal one r equal zero they all seem to come together

1098
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:11,010
and this is the data but the data allows for various models and you can see

1099
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:17,210
you can have models with very low value of r corresponding to low values

1100
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:25,630
today of omega in the gravitational waves produced by inflation so r by the day can

1101
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:34,480
be quite small you often see papers that state that w map three and sloan

1102
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:40,110
suggest that r has to be cannot be very small I don't see

1103
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:49,390
how those statements are supported by the data so these are models of inflation potentials

1104
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:56,630
that can be generated to fit the data and you see there's a range of allowed values of the find r

1105
01:22:56,630 --> 01:23:03,590
can be quite small so there's no reason from the data i believe to bel to

1106
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:09,770
imagine that we're just on the verge of discovering the gravitational wave background

1107
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:17,760
we can only hope that the gravitational wave background is close to being observed one of

1108
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:24,210
the ways the gravitational wave background would be observed in the cmb is through the

1109
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:33,990
effect of polarization of the gravitational background radiation on the cmb the polarization pattern

1110
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:42,630
can be decomposed into something known as an e mode and something knowns as a b mode this is the

1111
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:50,230
moral equivalent of the decomposition of a vector field into a graident and a curl

1112
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:58,050
it's slightly more complicated for polarization because there's no direction there's no arrow associated there's

1113
01:23:58,050 --> 01:24:06,850
no direction to the polarization there's no preferred direction to the polarization so by doing an

1114
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:13,570
analysis of the polarization pattern of the microwave background you can get information all in

1115
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:24,290
the contribution of gravitational waves to the density to the temperature perturbations and in

1116
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:35,010
terms of looking for the gravitational wave background ligo and experiments going on now

1117
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:44,390
can prove can probe as a function of the frequency various limits on omega gravitational waves pulsar

1118
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:50,270
timing gives us more information and cmb gives us information here

1119
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:59,930
this Lisa in the future will push this down but to really push down the inflation prediction this is

1120
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:06,330
for r equal to ten to the minus two there is proposals for a new satellite

1121
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:12,290
known as the Big Bang observer which will push down to omega in gravitational waves of

1122
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:21,370
ten to the minus sixteen however I remind you that ten to the minus there are models of

1123
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:26,690
inflation that give ten to the minus sixteen but there also models of inflation that

1124
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:33,980
give omega in gravitational waves much smaller than that so there is no guarantee that this will

1125
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:41,800
discover the gravitational waves from inflation now let me turn to a little bit of theory

1126
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:52,970
and ask does inflation tell us anything about supersymmetry or strings well the inflaton

1127
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:58,730
scalar potential must be flat so you think it has to be stable to radiative

1128
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:04,990
corrections so this was stopped for a long time to say aha this is

1129
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:13,590
evidence that there is supersymmetry to have a model that's stable to radiative corrections so

1130
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:18,570
that's sort of correct but if you examine it in detail the things are not so clean and i'll

1131
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:27,790
give you a reference to a long review article by lyth and riotto many supersymmetric models of inflation

1132
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:34,610
give a potential that's sort of a hybrid time type but in susy there's no general

1133
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:40,970
prediction for the scalar spectrum index we do sort of expect n minus one to

1134
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:47,330
be small but there's no general prediction for n the running of n or the amplitude

1135
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:53,710
of the gravitational wave background these are expected to be small in many models of

1136
01:26:53,710 --> 01:27:04,100
supersymmetry what we need here is observational guidance and in terms of inflation and strings and the

1137
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:11,930
connection of inflation and strings to branes cliff burgess makes the remarkable observation that inflation and strings

1138
01:27:11,950 --> 01:27:20,460
were made for each other because inflation is a phenomenon in search of a theory and strings are

1139
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:27,640
in search of a phenomenon so you think you know when you put the what ads in the paper in the personal section

1140
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:34,290
you know phenomenon looking for theory and theory looking for phenomenon they would naturally get together

1141
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:40,370
and this has been examined by many people most stringy or braney models can be expressed

1142
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:46,930
in terms of an effective field theory ineffectively in an inflaton model

1143
01:27:46,930 --> 01:27:55,870
single-field slow-roll model so the phenomenological approach for the inflaton is probably useful here in

1144
01:27:55,870 --> 01:28:03,770
in stringy models of inflation the heavy states seem to decouple the expansion rate during inflation

1145
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:07,430
that just distribution much more slowly

1146
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:11,870
and if you're trying to compete against the best strategy which is everyone so while

1147
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,930
so the best strategy which is

1148
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:18,480
k times in hindsight you can by just changing the little bits that can extricate

1149
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,860
plus one

1150
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,510
so which is no time get one here which is two times the

1151
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:29,000
which is one two years of numbers which plus one basically and that kind of

1152
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:33,720
OK so you can

1153
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:44,310
exactly because it so if you're not worried about the amputation time to do it

1154
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,040
so for thinking about

1155
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,910
OK good

1156
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:50,100
so one way to see that it's possible

1157
01:28:50,110 --> 01:28:52,370
it's possible to do this is the

1158
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:57,460
we think having an expert in we're thinking about switch strategies which k times we

1159
01:28:57,460 --> 01:29:00,530
can instantiate one

1160
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:07,120
new expert for every possible switch k times among the old expert so we have

1161
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,430
OK so

1162
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:14,990
right OK so so members we've had is an expert to trying to do nearly

1163
01:29:14,990 --> 01:29:17,770
as well as the best one and we say OK now we're interested in the

1164
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:21,780
nearly as well as the best strategies which is k times so with instantiate one

1165
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:24,530
new expert for every

1166
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,160
you say when they switch

1167
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:30,190
OK so

1168
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,260
so just a single plenty time that

1169
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:36,880
we have to say one expert for while at some point today when it's going

1170
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,290
to switch and then we can switch to and with can switch to we can

1171
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:46,520
instantiate new experts region switching strategies if we want to explicitly do that actually turns

1172
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,100
out that

1173
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,280
and then you have entered the n choose k

1174
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:55,880
and to the k possible orders in which things could switch

1175
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:59,930
she doesn't

1176
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:03,180
quebec it has to be able to say what

1177
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:07,280
right across the

1178
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:14,980
right next to the next right right actually we'll see will see another argument

1179
01:30:15,530 --> 01:30:17,440
it turns out that actually by just

1180
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:21,760
by just being careful about knowledge and the way to get small you just basically

1181
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:26,070
keep the same get about like so if the weights get very small and make

1182
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:28,790
sure you really have to keep penalizing

1183
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:32,430
i mean it's already been that's your so you know

1184
01:30:32,450 --> 01:30:38,000
mistakes and to make some mistakes cutting it down next multiplicatively doesn't take too many

1185
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,840
mistakes for someone's waiting in very small you're not paying attention to its weight is

1186
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,850
one hundred thousand young you get down to one or two

1187
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:50,260
so i mean this is leave it there and then it turns out later on

1188
01:30:50,350 --> 01:30:56,940
that that should be good strategy doesn't take quite so long before its relatively high

1189
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,160
OK then we want to estimate out

1190
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:03,280
the predictors may actually go

1191
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,540
there is one more thing

1192
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:11,920
one thing i talked about a a little bit actually it's related to this point

1193
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,310
here so let me just bring this back up

1194
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:17,980
is that we can generalize this

1195
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:23,880
this we can generalize to the case where our strategy to what we also want

1196
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,960
to say on rainy day we do nearly as well as the best rapper in

1197
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:27,560
a day

1198
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:30,380
and what if we want on mondays do nearly as well as the best route

1199
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:34,330
from monday and so in general we have we have a bunch of prediction rules

1200
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:35,240
if that

1201
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:40,960
so i think is and and have or and experts always raise the economic prediction

1202
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:46,350
what if we have an if then rules so if might be if it's monday

1203
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:52,050
use happy or if the document has the word football predicted about sports or

1204
01:31:52,150 --> 01:31:57,820
you know if if this database has this property and this property there are the

1205
01:31:57,820 --> 01:32:00,530
data that then it's of some fraud

1206
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:03,500
this entry has always

1207
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:07,550
flag has being brought to my but if then rules that you might have carefully

1208
01:32:07,550 --> 01:32:10,730
picked out or you might not carefully picked out you might have to generate a

1209
01:32:10,730 --> 01:32:14,000
lot of them and you don't know the answer for any of them really good

1210
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:16,860
but we would like it if some of them are good

1211
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,210
then you do well to

1212
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:21,100
so you'd like is that for each rule i

1213
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,610
you know if relies good

1214
01:32:23,650 --> 01:32:28,280
then we like to say have the property that when wildfires

1215
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:34,940
in those times that the times that's when rule i fires you do well

1216
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:39,010
i suspect that this is an actual got a bunch of rules some of them

1217
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:41,880
might be good some of them might be that it might be a great ruled

1218
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:45,030
on mondays introduce this path might be bad

1219
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,470
it might be that you know

1220
01:32:46,490 --> 01:32:49,180
but also documented exports is good abroad

1221
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:53,380
football soccer predict it's about politics might be about or might be good i don't

1222
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:55,550
if you have a bunch of these things

1223
01:32:55,570 --> 01:33:00,070
and just sitting around every day some of them fire you try to figure out

1224
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:02,960
which ones to use and you like to say if there's if if there's the

1225
01:33:02,970 --> 01:33:04,090
rule they had

1226
01:33:04,190 --> 01:33:07,020
maybe it doesn't quite often one part is really good

1227
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,770
so you'd like to be able to pay attention to it so fires you do

1228
01:33:09,770 --> 01:33:11,730
well that's what you'd like to do

1229
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:17,080
so for each i guarantee do nearly as well as it does on the time

1230
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:18,700
OK so for all

1231
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:22,330
i i want are expected costs are algorithm to be nearly as good as the

1232
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:25,670
cost of the i th row in the time steps so the cost of our

1233
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:29,020
algorithm when the i will fire should close the cost of the i th row

1234
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:31,960
when fires was

1235
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,240
and then i i briefly one of an algorithm that lets you do that

1236
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:44,090
OK actually so so one reason to bring this up now is that if we

1237
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:48,080
think about now we want to think about these as the change

1238
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:50,040
one way to think about that

1239
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,350
imagine a rule that says

1240
01:33:52,450 --> 01:33:53,600
i want you

1241
01:33:53,610 --> 01:33:56,200
to use

1242
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:59,060
this past

1243
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,730
but only

1244
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,580
from day one hundred

1245
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:08,480
three and

1246
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:09,760
how about the rule

1247
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:14,530
i want to use this path but only between is eighty and

1248
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:15,640
ninety seven

1249
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:18,800
so you can imagine if you've got and have

1250
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:24,060
in your life at each time step now you instantiate and times he's square

1251
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:28,430
if then rules each rules of the form

1252
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:31,890
you this path from this time for that

1253
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:38,820
so that makes sense so got this and different patterns like the gold medal down

1254
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:43,350
to play this game for a long time like instantiate rule where one of the

1255
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:44,660
rule says

1256
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:46,320
in this time window

1257
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,130
we should use that

1258
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:53,830
and now this kind guarantee means that in every time window we are doing nearly

1259
01:34:53,830 --> 01:34:54,670
as well

1260
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:59,600
as the best trout in that time window

1261
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,790
to group them nicely on the disk so that we can answer range queries quickly

1262
01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:06,380
given all this it is about a hundred miles from pittsburgh

1263
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:12,030
we want to do it quickly so how does this method works that best represented

1264
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:16,670
from these methods in this class of methods is the so-called trees which are specifically

1265
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:21,890
designed for the disk the characteristic of the disk is that it takes only seconds

1266
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:26,250
to retrieve that this page therefore by based on the disk which is very very

1267
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:27,080
very slow

1268
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:31,890
compared to memory accesses so we want to make as few disk access as possible

1269
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:33,800
and want to park our

1270
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:40,020
cities or of time series or whatever we're interested in in a few days pages

1271
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:45,300
so here's the method are trees stands for region actually so it can be used

1272
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:50,170
to handle not only points are like cities i mentioned before images of stock prices

1273
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:54,890
but even region so suppose we have lakes where represent every lake with its minimum

1274
01:35:54,890 --> 01:35:56,110
bounding rectangle

1275
01:35:56,120 --> 01:36:02,780
degenerate lakes are points and the method can complement points

1276
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:06,940
so the method there are methods as we have all these lakes all these rectangles

1277
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:11,360
the way to handle them so that we minimize the number of disk accesses to

1278
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,420
group nearby

1279
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:16,750
nearby lakes into parent nodes and then

1280
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:24,140
group nearby parent node simple grandparent notes until we have one great-great-great grandfather right and

1281
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:27,080
so this is what we have in mind this is what is x what is

1282
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:32,280
actually happening on the these great so these lakes are nearby there are three algorithms

1283
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:36,980
determined other nearby spatially close so we put them in the same this space so

1284
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:39,230
this forty by to this page

1285
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:42,930
it might be empty might have empty slots that's OK right as long as they

1286
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:47,080
are not too many empty slots this another space another space so this is the

1287
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:52,540
part in this page which has the minimum bounding rectangle but p one right about

1288
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:57,080
and so on so this method can help us search

1289
01:36:57,090 --> 01:37:02,940
weekly because we can exploit the tree structure support the queries here this is a

1290
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:10,220
favourite spot favourite CD and says find everything within ten miles away from pittsburgh right

1291
01:37:10,230 --> 01:37:14,220
and if we could be the have a would have square it doesn't really matter

1292
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:19,300
what always have the main bottleneck to right how will this help us avoid there

1293
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:22,260
are tree will help us avoid disk accesses

1294
01:37:22,270 --> 01:37:26,880
because we start from the road will start from the route ten the seconds to

1295
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:27,860
fit the root

1296
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:31,540
now we are scanning the mmm and we see that p one does not qualify

1297
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:36,760
has no chance of containing anything related because this is the west coast right it's

1298
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:41,070
oregon so no way to to be close to bits right so we don't do

1299
01:37:41,070 --> 01:37:46,990
this disk access and we don't know this disc access these are qualifying that that

1300
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,340
this may or may not have something of interest so we go down only these

1301
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:55,150
two disc access is of course disappointing example and there is no real system we

1302
01:37:55,160 --> 01:38:00,420
have many more levels three four five levels and see if we have a small

1303
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:05,720
query the disc savings will be among those with access five and disk accesses as

1304
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:10,690
opposed to one thousand disk access that somebody else the sequential scan would would

1305
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:16,330
retrieve so this is the idea behind trees pizza twenty year-old method that has been

1306
01:38:16,330 --> 01:38:21,150
implemented in several systems it's available on the web so it's it's great and we

1307
01:38:21,150 --> 01:38:24,680
don't even have to to think about implementing it we can download code and it

1308
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:25,700
will help us

1309
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:31,330
monads multidimensional points and rectangles so the bottom the conclusion from this part of the

1310
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:35,730
presentation is that we can have fast indexing through

1311
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:39,500
o multimedia objects by extracting a few features

1312
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:44,410
two three four numbers from every stocking months video video clip and then we can

1313
01:38:44,410 --> 01:38:49,080
use an off the shelf spatial access methods even the original our trees are good

1314
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:54,700
there are huge there's a huge number of variations of our trees are plaster star

1315
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:55,610
and so on

1316
01:38:55,620 --> 01:39:00,330
the survey by get a list of all but the map but this is the

1317
01:39:00,330 --> 01:39:03,590
general philosophy behind this method let's see

1318
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:07,140
let's continue here and see how we extract features tried was said let's look at

1319
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:11,880
some of the standard deviation how do we do that in a more systematic way

1320
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:17,060
and here's the many outline the fourier transform we see the free transform singular value

1321
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:18,730
decomposition and then

1322
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:22,640
multidimensional scaling and fast

1323
01:39:23,470 --> 01:39:26,880
the discrete fourier transform is an excellent method for

1324
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,370
time series

1325
01:39:28,570 --> 01:39:33,270
and actually the for images right the two-dimensional fourier transform can help us compress real

1326
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:39,980
signals and we can use a few coefficients to describe the signals here is visual

1327
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:43,680
proof visual hint that

1328
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:49,360
the fourier transform is good for compressing signal so this is the dow jones industrial

1329
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:53,310
average the index from four six to four six months

1330
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:57,160
this is a real dataset and this is

1331
01:39:57,220 --> 01:40:02,930
the blue line is its approximation was the first to fourier coefficients

1332
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:04,310
and we see that

1333
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:05,530
we have

1334
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:10,170
half a year so it's what what hundred fifty numbers being approximated very well by

1335
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:14,980
three numbers the two or three coefficients quite because if we do the spectrum we

1336
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:19,490
see this is the frequency of the free transform the amplitude of the next case

1337
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:23,870
we see that the first coefficient is around one million the next is around hundred

1338
01:40:23,870 --> 01:40:29,140
thousand to fifty fifty thousand the first few coefficients give you all the information you

1339
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:33,860
want maybe except for the tiny little deviations that we have so the first two

1340
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:41,350
good for your revisions are usually good describe stock prices and so related signals

1341
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:45,090
let's see the optimal method the singular value decomposition how many of you have heard

1342
01:40:45,090 --> 01:40:46,880
of this we did before

1343
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:50,220
although everybody OK so it would be a quick review then

1344
01:40:50,650 --> 01:40:53,520
this is the optimal method for dimensionality reduction

1345
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:57,450
footnote under the euclidean metric right which means that if we have the cloud of

1346
01:40:58,790 --> 01:41:00,350
so this could be

1347
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:04,880
the first demons and we decide the first protein imagine we decided to extract features

1348
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:09,410
area and the brightness right so this area of the first three months brightness of

1349
01:41:09,410 --> 01:41:13,480
the second of the first three months second months sediments also suppose we have all

1350
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:14,950
the protein images

1351
01:41:14,970 --> 01:41:20,800
and usually them either and probably there is a correlation between area brightness SVD will

1352
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,680
captured exactly the correlation

1353
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:25,320
svd will give us the best line

1354
01:41:25,430 --> 01:41:31,590
well we can project these points this two-dimensional points so that the sum of squares

1355
01:41:31,590 --> 01:41:40,480
models so they use pcfgs they lexicalized all along the rules and basically they typically

1356
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,680
which use generative models

1357
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:46,890
and learn the parameters of the generative model by using the maximum likelihood with the

1358
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:48,860
right that of smoothing

1359
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:53,440
and more recently what will be and this is also what we will be looking

1360
01:41:53,440 --> 01:42:00,220
at here is how can use more discriminative learning methods to actually infer past reason

1361
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:00,720
so to do

1362
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:04,140
natural language parsing

1363
01:42:04,170 --> 01:42:09,240
OK and then i want really talk much about this but here is a reference

1364
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:16,060
like paper that's now a couple of years old also if you think about recognition

1365
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:17,740
of handwritten words

1366
01:42:17,790 --> 01:42:21,120
you have a situation where really

1367
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:27,080
you know you you don't want to just segment the image and then predict individually

1368
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:32,380
what the characters are that you see in these pixel images but rather you want

1369
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:36,970
to take dependencies into account so probably on the word level at least so that

1370
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:39,200
for instance what you see here

1371
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:43,340
you know that you not mistakenly taken that from e let's say but rather for

1372
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:48,080
c like courses right because this is more likely so you have a lot of

1373
01:42:48,090 --> 01:42:53,510
examples like that where there's a lot of local ambiguities you make a decision locally

1374
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,860
right you might get the wrong result but you can help

1375
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:00,550
you know you can use the context of what you see

1376
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:03,330
to the right or to the left what you think you see rates are you

1377
01:43:03,330 --> 01:43:05,600
classify these characters

1378
01:43:05,610 --> 01:43:10,270
as the guiding know as additional help as providing additional evidence

1379
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:16,650
four for recognizing these characters

1380
01:43:20,540 --> 01:43:27,580
and then finally i just like to mention mention this example here and like

1381
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:34,270
a group of people that has worked in this system the freeman's group which has

1382
01:43:34,270 --> 01:43:37,650
to do with problems in computer vision where

1383
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:42,510
traditionally people have often looked at things like object recognition

1384
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:48,450
image annotation have really thought that i thought of that as like sort of an

1385
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:53,200
independent problem so i thought i look for particular object in the image maybe a

1386
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:58,020
search over certain windows and regions in the image and then i have some function

1387
01:43:58,020 --> 01:43:59,540
that tells me whether

1388
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:03,720
you know there's enough evidence that we actually see and monitor somewhere in the image

1389
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:04,470
let's say

1390
01:44:04,510 --> 01:44:09,320
and then the prediction would be OK this is an image that contains screen computer

1391
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:13,710
monitors but what's interesting is also to actually

1392
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:17,830
i understand that there are dependencies between the different things that we see in an

1393
01:44:17,830 --> 01:44:21,340
image so that you know this is the computer monitor maybe it makes it more

1394
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:24,190
likely that there is a keyboard and mouse nearby

1395
01:44:24,230 --> 01:44:30,570
right so i should make these decisions independently but rather to predict whole scene graph

1396
01:44:30,570 --> 01:44:35,860
if you like all recognise objects in the context and hopefully that will help

1397
01:44:35,890 --> 01:44:38,820
with the recognition accuracy

1398
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:41,180
OK sorry i have one more example

1399
01:44:41,190 --> 01:44:48,400
forgot about this one so this is also related to work with others

1400
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:52,880
reference here and there is some work that was your hands has been doing over

1401
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:56,490
the last couple of years and this is the problem where

1402
01:44:56,590 --> 01:45:03,960
the inputs from computational biology where the input is the representation of a protein

1403
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:07,750
so here is the primary sequence so it will be

1404
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:13,550
just a string of letters every letter will correspond to an amino acid and what

1405
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:15,490
we would like to do is

1406
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:21,670
in the case of secondary structure prediction we want to identify segments that correspond to

1407
01:45:21,670 --> 01:45:26,800
certain types of secondary protein structure like a certain type of the helix or sheet

1408
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:30,490
or things like that so there is usually a very small

1409
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:35,840
i forbid that biologists happy with and basically what we need to know is which

1410
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:42,460
on this string actually corresponds to a particular structure and then also what people are

1411
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:47,130
interested in and that if if you want to take a step further this to

1412
01:45:47,130 --> 01:45:49,820
the way he set up his model was to say it was it was very

1413
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:53,590
much like an kind of i think inspired by this sort of model or or

1414
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:56,650
the sort of model where he said so it's actually sort of like this only

1415
01:45:56,650 --> 01:46:00,480
the other way around if you you know it when you see something like this

1416
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:01,960
this is the kind of phenomenon

1417
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:04,650
right you see up visual event like this

1418
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:09,230
this contact thing or imagine like hitting a baseball or cricket ball something things you

1419
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:13,550
visual of annual security sound in your mind conjoined those two

1420
01:46:13,550 --> 01:46:18,030
similar kind of thing happens in ventriloquism right when you you see somebody's mouth moving

1421
01:46:18,030 --> 01:46:21,210
or the or not but the failures of this one when you see it badly

1422
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:26,760
dubbed movie in foreign language right so your visual system is actually very good at

1423
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:31,710
integrating or sort of deciding should i integrate this set of visual

1424
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:37,190
events with this set of auditory events and you can cut our suggested modelling that

1425
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:42,070
as a kind of bayesian model selection thing where where you're actually comparing hypotheses that

1426
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:45,400
maybe there is one cause of both the visual auditory to maybe there's two different

1427
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:50,260
causes so it's sort of sort of like this only slightly different graphical models

1428
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:52,150
i think in this paper argues that

1429
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:57,730
there was a slightly different way to i guess that there was a debate about

1430
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:02,070
whether it's whether there is evidence that people are are doing sort of math model

1431
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:07,210
selection or actual model averaging and i think that the data are still a little

1432
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:13,420
bit ambiguous that's one of the things people are arguing about

1433
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:18,900
one of the brothers really

1434
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:26,190
you know so that's so that's so there's really active area of research on how

1435
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:30,280
our however probability butions represented the brain and power some of these very basic kinds

1436
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:34,130
of things like just you know computing posterior gaussians or or

1437
01:47:34,530 --> 01:47:39,190
about the the the most sophisticated it's got his car common filter like

1438
01:47:39,210 --> 01:47:43,250
how does the brain to common filtering people like alex to a

1439
01:47:44,230 --> 01:47:49,110
the external has worked on this peter diane there's there's a lot of people interested

1440
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:50,940
in that but

1441
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:55,480
for the most part it's only focused on the very simplest bayesian statistics like how

1442
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:59,250
do you represent distribution all say in the population codes so how might a population

1443
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:03,570
of neurons with different tunings represented distribution and how might you just combine the prior

1444
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:06,400
and likelihood to get a posterior

1445
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:11,130
people are starting to get to some slightly more interestingly structured models but

1446
01:48:11,170 --> 01:48:16,420
nobody's really tried and nobody really has a clue how to represent your even these

1447
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:18,730
kinds of structure structure learning problems

1448
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,820
i think that's

1449
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:26,050
pretty clearly to me at least the single biggest challenge in computational neuroscience is that

1450
01:48:26,050 --> 01:48:30,710
problem it's coarser problem to bayesian computational methods but it's it's more generally a problem

1451
01:48:30,710 --> 01:48:35,190
of what cognitive science tells us is that human knowledge has all sorts of structure

1452
01:48:35,190 --> 01:48:35,980
to it

1453
01:48:35,990 --> 01:48:39,110
yet when we look at the brain

1454
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:42,860
we don't know how any of that structure is represented right there's a very nice

1455
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:48,630
fit between the kind of conventional machine learning toolkit of of learning functions in high

1456
01:48:48,630 --> 01:48:53,340
dimensional spaces and looking at the brain where there's you know high dimensional spaces in

1457
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:58,270
the patterns of neural activation or synaptic strengths and so there's a nice fit between

1458
01:48:58,270 --> 01:49:02,460
that you know you can do a lot of computational neuroscience under the idea that

1459
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:03,420
it's all about

1460
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:05,390
you know regression in

1461
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:08,100
high dimensional spaces but

1462
01:49:08,110 --> 01:49:12,400
i think cognitive science tells us pretty clearly we need much more structured representations and

1463
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:16,840
we're machine learning and statistical AI has gone recently showing us tools for doing that

1464
01:49:17,030 --> 01:49:20,760
but bringing that into kind with the brain is complete history and i think you

1465
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:23,690
know where we we have some very speculative ideas but it's

1466
01:49:23,730 --> 01:49:27,520
you know that's that's a that's the most important problem to work on i i

1467
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:31,190
would urge you too much to work on it so far but i figure when

1468
01:49:31,190 --> 01:49:34,420
i run out of sort of things i can actually make progress on that's will

1469
01:49:34,430 --> 01:49:36,800
spend all my time thinking about

1470
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:40,520
any other questions about the stuff

1471
01:49:40,550 --> 01:49:46,600
right so so let me let me go into the concept learning session obviously i

1472
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:49,100
won't and we only have about fifteen minutes or so i want to try to

1473
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:53,350
make it much stalinism i can i will finish the next time and talk a

1474
01:49:53,350 --> 01:49:55,800
little about intuitive theories

1475
01:49:55,810 --> 01:49:59,760
so this was the problem that i used to motivate this

1476
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:06,220
learning learning category from examples of it's it's it's interesting because

1477
01:50:06,230 --> 01:50:07,810
as post here

1478
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:12,960
it's not the the traditional way the classification has been presented in in statistics and

1479
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:16,600
machine learning where again the usual in the textbook picture you start off with is

1480
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:20,270
you get a bunch of positive examples in a bunch of negative examples and you

1481
01:50:20,270 --> 01:50:25,770
either learning discriminating function or you're doing something like a density based approach bayesian classifier

1482
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:26,410
i'd like

1483
01:50:27,690 --> 01:50:31,340
so a lot more non development

1484
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:37,870
and might think the time we were debugging

1485
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:40,520
maybe one or two megabytes

1486
01:50:40,530 --> 01:50:45,350
then start to rapidly growing that is right

1487
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:48,170
so it's much more complicated piece of but still

1488
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:54,370
much more complicated pieces of what the but the

1489
01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:55,790
so we're going on

1490
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:59,070
go hard hard because you you get a situation where

1491
01:50:59,090 --> 01:51:00,120
a person who

1492
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,850
o reproduced above

1493
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:05,880
does not have the technical knowledge to fix them

1494
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:10,400
and the development company produced by the way beautifully on the other

1495
01:51:10,590 --> 01:51:12,510
is always

1496
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:15,750
all these trains run however the development

1497
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:22,180
because of the one system which is being tested very very carefully

1498
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:26,370
there are some of the things we see which after helping

1499
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:29,920
one of which is do a lot less hardware

1500
01:51:30,270 --> 01:51:32,120
when they started

1501
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:39,320
every laptop and its own unique ships every laptop and its own unique videos

1502
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:42,350
there were something like twenty

1503
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:47,890
twenty five different video card manufacturers commonly encountered

1504
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:54,480
a lot of time and then people like complex made their own disk controller

1505
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:57,060
so one of these really helped is that

1506
01:51:57,110 --> 01:51:58,600
every laptop today

1507
01:51:58,610 --> 01:52:01,860
it's built about four standard designs

1508
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:07,470
every PC today is built from again very small number the

1509
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:11,840
microsoft has also been really really helpful

1510
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:18,810
because microsoft introduced a thing called the windows hardware quality testing wh around

1511
01:52:18,860 --> 01:52:21,800
one of the things that mean in microsoft word

1512
01:52:21,810 --> 01:52:26,660
to get your driver into my windows live text saying

1513
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:30,430
microsoft says this is OK it's good quality drive

1514
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:35,490
it has to get all this really really expensive testing

1515
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:40,010
one thing is this is done is finally persuaded hardware

1516
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:42,700
do you stand

1517
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:45,130
because there is a

1518
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:47,420
roughly standard windows driver

1519
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:52,340
example USB storage is a USB memory stick

1520
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:54,560
everybody uses

1521
01:52:54,620 --> 01:53:00,590
because it is too expensive to write your own windows drivers for XP of vista

1522
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:04,990
and the side effects but is that we have a USB storage drive they normally

1523
01:53:04,990 --> 01:53:09,690
working limits as well

1524
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:13,310
the second thing we've got its distribution

1525
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:15,070
most of the

1526
01:53:15,090 --> 01:53:19,420
end users we we deal with we deal with it directly

1527
01:53:19,450 --> 01:53:25,120
that means that there are thirty thousand people with an obscure configuration but

1528
01:53:25,130 --> 01:53:29,620
all banging on canonical door all the on our mailing list

1529
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:34,170
rather than sitting on the kind the same why does my computer

1530
01:53:34,190 --> 01:53:37,530
and that's enormously help

1531
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:43,800
we can make these distributions of also authorities about their

1532
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:45,920
the acting is a

1533
01:53:45,930 --> 01:53:47,260
go between

1534
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:50,990
between the non-technical users and technical community

1535
01:53:51,010 --> 01:53:55,860
there are some exceptions some of the groups are very technique

1536
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:58,420
but for the majority of the distribution

1537
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:00,440
really cheap

1538
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:01,890
the the end user one

1539
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:03,200
from the the kernel

1540
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:08,410
given the kind of things they need

1541
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:10,840
we also have a much better tools

1542
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:14,840
very shortly

1543
01:54:14,850 --> 01:54:18,010
so we got better ways of helping users find

1544
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:24,100
better ways also finding but before we should

1545
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:26,590
the final thing which is really good

1546
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:30,780
is of a lot of the users we have no bearing on ten

1547
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:34,660
very large numbers the most you get help

1548
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:38,400
even if you say can you build new

1549
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:39,660
the entries of

1550
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:41,410
not know it's

1551
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:44,840
i have no idea how to build and you can see what do i do

1552
01:54:44,850 --> 01:54:47,270
can you send me some instruction

1553
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:50,510
so we're gonna use as you would like to help we just have to figure
