1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
box if

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,690
let's make it

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:08,550
him to be simple

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,310
not box is p

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,910
and i'm going to actually just take the liberty of writing that is

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,390
that because you know in negation normal form works

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,870
repeatedly apply the usual and all rules together with the following rules to obtain blah

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,600
blah blah OK

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,600
so if i apply and then roll i'm going to get

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,310
fox if p

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,300
diamond if p

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,310
all i do is i changed the conjunction to ascend that was our andrew

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,540
and now

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,550
i'm stuck because i don't have any conjunctions and disjunctions so this is the stage

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,820
at which i would apply the k rule in the traditional blue

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,250
right now the problem is this

17
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,650
if you apply the k rule

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,570
you jump to another successor which is arbitrarily far away

19
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,950
but if you have some other formulae we don't have them in this case but

20
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,780
if you have some of the formulae which are of the form next something

21
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,670
then you jumped too far

22
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,390
so what diamond does it says you know jump to some of the tree

23
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,130
which is in the future of i

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,640
but if there is some extra stuff lying around here which says i know next

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,160
q and next next

26
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,390
not qnx next next q or something like that

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,820
you all those behind and you jump directly to here and make p two

28
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,430
and you've gone too far

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,680
so what you have to do

30
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,200
is you have to

31
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,260
take care of these guys by using the one stipulation

32
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,560
and this is the way the fixed point comes out that's exactly what these things

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,840
are doing so it says if you have

34
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,900
a negated next in just put push it through so this is part of the

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,650
next negation

36
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,150
if you have a box

37
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,890
then rewrite it this so we do have box

38
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,100
so i rewrite it as

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,800
next box if p

40
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:18,220
i said OK all i've done is i've taken that box

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,240
and we know that is that

42
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,750
taking that box

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,120
and we know that is

44
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,570
so this one here i've switched over thank you

45
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,350
because i would have got to the end and wondered why didn't class thank you

46
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,800
would have been able to find out why what else have we got we've got

47
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,830
so we can apply this guy

48
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,630
well let's break this guy down first show it let's that one we know that

49
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,600
it's harmless

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,440
now we've got a diamond so

51
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,680
what do i do

52
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,800
i turned it into a disjunction

53
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,780
not p all

54
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,290
diamond if not p

55
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,130
yes no

56
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,030
stop me

57
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,890
now what i got a good disjunction so i can split

58
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,860
again p

59
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,600
he PM just copying things

60
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,380
and now the disjunction goes down here

61
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,600
i copy

62
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,350
but this bit

63
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,950
and this is just comes here

64
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:43,050
OK now what

65
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,840
current node is now of the form next

66
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,900
for nearly z where z contains only atoms negated atoms and down for a kind

67
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,450
worried about the downfall of supposed to be copying down the formula star but i

68
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,830
can't be bothered because you don't actually need in the procedure

69
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,780
you need to the completeness

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,170
this is of the form the next something

71
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,860
and z ways that contains only atoms negated atoms in that

72
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,740
OK now i'm supposed to create a success but there isn't any point because this

73
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,920
is a contradiction right so i'm going to stop that

74
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,850
in reality what the

75
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,090
what the theoretical procedures do is they

76
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,290
keep going right to actually create a successor here

77
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,690
but we want

78
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,720
what about the other side we haven't got a contradiction so now we apply the

79
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,110
next rule what is the next rules say

80
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,070
a plus successor w one containing x in other words

81
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,010
what this is is that your success to make this true success estimate is true

82
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,070
there are diamonds in boxes which talk about for the points

83
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,630
right because i compile them way i use the fixed point

84
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,610
to compile them

85
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:05,170
the recursive equation to compile the way i compile them down into this

86
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,580
an element of the time

87
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,380
and in that element the thing is actually linear

88
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,570
so so i can do the same

89
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,610
that's the beauty of it

90
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,290
o piecewise linear is good

91
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,440
now let me ask you what's the basis what is in this language what the

92
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,410
what's the basic what

93
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,450
you've given me all the functions at once there

94
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,460
all pieces of suppose the boundary conditions are you have zero equals zero

95
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,320
and you have one equals zero

96
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,490
and suppose i chopped the thing into

97
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,610
one two two three four five l

98
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,260
so that i had really so i really have four degrees of freedom

99
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,920
so in this for you

100
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,730
but now tell me the four basis functions

101
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,910
that you want me to the

102
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,680
OK that's what will stick

103
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,530
he made them look like science and cosine

104
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,290
so maybe one of his

105
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,330
functions will have gone up and then another one will have had an oscillation another

106
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,410
one had to i'm looking for another option

107
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,040
basis for

108
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,940
center for fees

109
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:39,480
combinations give the

110
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,280
i i would be happy if they were

111
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,680
but i'm more

112
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,980
that's good but i'm the most important is

113
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,020
the calculation should be

114
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,180
so i'm looking may come as simple as you can

115
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,300
and your choice of making look like science and cosines was pretty simple

116
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:12,520
but let's make it

117
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,790
that's possible that's possible well but OK i could

118
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,480
now let's look some markers is exactly

119
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,280
what you want

120
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:33,120
more so to enable by animal piece by piece that's the winning idea

121
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,040
the here is one of our function

122
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,380
and then here's the second one

123
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:45,950
and well they didn't forever

124
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,820
so they do overlap and i don't get that orthogonality

125
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,290
but i decided prepared to live without it for the

126
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,530
for this local

127
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,430
and to be local is is

128
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,800
is it has to be up to date

129
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,220
i mean that's really local stuff that's what you'll see with wavelets to that there

130
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,640
is a local basis so there's one guy

131
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,410
the second guy peaks at point two

132
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,850
the third guy peaks at point three

133
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,400
the fourth skype except point four and their combinations

134
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:24,330
if any

135
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,880
let me know hope

136
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,170
now that's a court

137
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,150
it's a shift

138
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,920
the true

139
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,270
shift is OK

140
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,400
but if i

141
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,780
if i multiply that by two which is

142
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,030
make it bigger

143
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,010
year if you're you're all this is the right stuff to think about the is

144
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,860
exactly the right if i if i combine this with this

145
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,450
then i can get anybody who does this and then stops

146
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,290
but then i got number three and number four

147
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,020
pick up

148
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:17,720
it somehow

149
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,300
OK that's one way to see

150
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,740
that these four guys are independent that in fact

151
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,730
the the seas actually have a meaning

152
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,520
the this season the c one the one multiplies this guy is actually the value

153
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,840
of this

154
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,810
the c one

155
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,970
and this is the sea too high

156
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,030
and this is the c three

157
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,920
i have to be negative and this is the c four

158
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,910
you see that the phi

159
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,120
if i take those things so the

160
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,220
these weights

161
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,590
are actually

162
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,180
o point values

163
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,900
which is kinda nice

164
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,380
so all i do now

165
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,880
what i wanna do now that is

166
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,840
i'm limiting myself to this four dimensional space

167
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,280
simple function

168
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,490
and these would be piecewise these would be linear finite elements

169
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,170
and now

170
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,920
is my equation becomes

171
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,020
it determines the seed

172
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,830
right now we've made the big decision of the basis

173
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,170
and those are the basis you mentioned i mean like

174
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,300
you know there other those the bases not

175
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,780
this finite elements

176
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,990
is that choice

177
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,410
well i find it almost don't have to be linear

178
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,350
we could we could imagine

179
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:55,350
parabola little pieces of parabola are little pieces of cubic

180
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,800
so those will be

181
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,410
quadratic elements cubic element

182
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,930
those are all this highly interested i mean there was like a golden age of

183
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,170
finite element

184
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,320
when everybody was creating

185
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,260
new bases

186
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,090
and of course everybody hoped that his basis would be

187
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,020
you know his name would be like immortal

188
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,130
and a few people probably well

189
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,800
piecewise linear somehow

190
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,080
i guess nobody's name got associated with it that

191
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,620
that the

192
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,960
it's just because it's so simple

193
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,580
come back to that question where are my equations for these

194
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,880
four c

195
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,870
how do i find the best seed

196
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,570
i i can see i've decided okay

197
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,110
i'm only going to allow functions that are combinations of these forces look like that

198
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,030
what's the best way how do i get the best one

199
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,800
so i

200
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,660
i need a cost function OK so what's my cost function

201
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,260
i guess it's

202
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,720
this guy

203
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,320
OK so so one way to do it

204
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,410
like this

205
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,890
in there

206
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:23,070
and minimize it is a function of four variables i'm back to the beginning of

207
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,570
the last lecture

208
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:29,800
n is for

209
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,700
you can you imagine doing that

210
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,380
i've decided what these functions are

211
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,660
so those are fixed my trial functions

212
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,510
the ones i'm trying to

213
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,550
what i don't know is the fourier coefficients

214
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,880
so i plug it in

215
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,590
to the

216
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,780
o thing that i'm trying to minimize and i minimize on but i've only got

217
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,180
four variables so i've there

218
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,220
the rayleigh ritz that's associated with the names of rayleigh ritz

219
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,660
galerkin had another idea

220
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,530
galerkin work

221
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,220
with this week form

222
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,740
galerkin and said OK

223
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,660
now i'm looking at this

224
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,860
this of this whole thing and element me put zero in yellow two

225
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,280
we're seeing the whole

226
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,820
weak form

227
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,260
in the yellow

228
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,900
give us the right solution

229
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,960
it's not estimating the right thing but this a small bias

230
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,540
but since we can

231
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,620
prove that

232
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,350
that this stays finite

233
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:44,790
then since we only comparing algorithms relative to each other in the scale on which

234
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,490
we are doesn't really matter so this means that we can

235
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,450
throughout proof we we know that although it's

236
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,000
biased we can still use it

237
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,000
OK so let me just show you some plots

238
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,160
this uncertainty in the value

239
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,780
the max

240
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,140
deviation from the unit matrix

241
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,980
in all directions

242
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,100
if we

243
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:27,530
compute take state the TV set of algorithms which is the temporal decorrelation algorithms and

244
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,420
compare the root mean squared error

245
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,320
of the solution

246
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,550
so it's only make make an artificial example so we we actually make an estimate

247
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,700
of of all sources

248
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,170
and measure how good

249
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,180
this estimate is in the root mean squared error sense

250
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,700
and then we plot

251
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,120
against this this uncertainty measure

252
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,060
we hope to be on the line in the dying

253
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,280
because this means that the uncertainty measure that we have constructed ourselves by means of

254
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,890
bootstrap is actually

255
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,440
giving us something like the root mean squared error

256
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,940
and then you see

257
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:16,880
actually if the blind source separation algorithms that we're using for this bootstrap thing

258
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,300
if it

259
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:26,500
doing small arrows then this uncertainty measures is a very good approximation

260
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,730
remember this

261
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,250
not using any information about the sources

262
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,750
and this is just

263
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,710
knowing the sources so this really coincides

264
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,610
and this is fun other algorithms and you see

265
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,090
for a particular example

266
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:49,710
that's making a slightly more complicated artificial example

267
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,800
so let's take

268
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,290
sine and the cosine

269
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,900
some speech signals

270
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,760
white gaussian noise

271
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,090
uniform distributed noise so

272
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:09,080
in ICA we typically can only deal with one goes noise component

273
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,490
certainly gas in noise doesn't have any temporal information

274
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,180
if we

275
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,100
you know apply some algorithm i mean if we would know this if you just

276
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,310
have a mixture and we apply some algorithm that

277
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,950
it takes high order statistics into account then of course the algorithm that takes high

278
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,300
order statistics into account would be able to distinguish between this one

279
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,110
one of those

280
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,460
these two

281
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,250
and and also these

282
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,290
these guys

283
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:48,600
the temporal as the time information algorithm would be able to distinguish would be able

284
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,970
to pull this one this one

285
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,390
these couldn't because there is no temporal structure

286
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:00,380
but in any case all these algorithms would give us some projection directions and we

287
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,770
you know be forced to believe if we wouldn't have means to assess the quality

288
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,260
so what does it look like

289
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,250
so this is now

290
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,850
with jade

291
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,140
and this is the estimated sourcing so you see a sign and the cosine sigma

292
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,420
and they form very same stable subspaces

293
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,740
OK so so this is the the matrix s that i that we had before

294
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,650
on the slides that s was composed of of all these angles

295
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,750
i j

296
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,950
that we have computed also

297
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,250
so so what what does it mean it means that

298
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,190
most of these things are very

299
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,390
you know the

300
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,450
so there are two subspaces one or two that the sine cosine and five and

301
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,520
that's the goal since

302
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,640
i said in the beginning it's impossible to to distinguish between more than one goes

303
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,850
and so with some creativity

304
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:15,110
they may well have some benefits for helping to improve the performance of search engines

305
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:21,900
OK i'm going to continue where i left off with logistic regression and so

306
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,440
we're talking about

307
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,850
the probability of a label y

308
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,700
this label y

309
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,930
conditions on the input x

310
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,130
and then we have the parameters alpha

311
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,420
data and the model

312
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,140
is that the logarithm p of one minus p

313
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,410
is linear so it's alpha plus

314
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,950
some of the j

315
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,310
beta j

316
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:08,400
some useful terminology so p is the probability of the event y and it's probably

317
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,630
y equals one

318
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,010
and then peel one minus p is called the odds

319
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,840
log p of one minus p

320
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,320
it's called the

321
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:25,720
the log odds so this model says the log odds is linear function and this

322
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,860
is a reasonable function because

323
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,820
the probabilities are bounded between zero and one

324
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,110
so odds then

325
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,580
going to take a value between

326
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,780
zero and positive infinity

327
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:47,870
and logos take values between negativeinfinity plus infinity and

328
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:54,160
that's the possible range of values of the linear function and so

329
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:59,970
it it wouldn't be mathematically coherent to make the probability be linear function of the

330
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,790
and so linear functions of the simplest sort of functions so and so

331
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,890
if we want simplicity want linear function

332
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,410
but then in order to map the range from negative infinity plus infinity to the

333
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,920
range zero to one

334
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,010
then the logo then among

335
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,270
the log odds or the inverse translational logodds is the simplest way of doing that

336
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,410
so this is really the

337
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,700
justification for the money

338
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,510
form of the logistic regression model that it's linear which is the simplest possible and

339
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,030
then with the transformation

340
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,000
something and this

341
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,960
if you have here

342
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,420
the log odds

343
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,210
and this is the zero point

344
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,410
and here you have the probability

345
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,480
which ranges from one to zero then

346
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,640
the log odds of zero

347
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,350
corresponds to a probability of point five

348
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,430
so the point five o point five is one of one is zero and this

349
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,140
function so the driver it's sigmoid shape it along stretched out as shape

350
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,720
it is a monotonic

351
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:26,270
so p is a monotonic function of logodds and logodds monotonic function of p

352
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,680
and so

353
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
the bigger

354
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,310
the bigger the value of this linear function

355
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,170
the bigger the probability

356
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,670
and so

357
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,650
that makes these coefficients interpretable

358
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,950
but you

359
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,930
so xj is the feature

360
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,980
x was thinking of x bar is being

361
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,720
vector of feature values remember

362
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,330
so this is some from j cause one to g

363
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,080
we have expert

364
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,100
is in heart of the d

365
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:08,420
and there's a very common special case for the features xj which is that they

366
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:14,520
are binary so effect so if xj causes xj equals one then that's a special

367
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,700
case of xj being a real number

368
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,640
and so

369
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,810
you know if if xj is real valued and baby j is positive

370
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,680
this parameter is saying that everything else being equal

371
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,660
a bigger value for xj

372
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,850
it makes

373
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,220
y equals one more likely

374
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,270
and if xj is binary

375
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,440
and pages positive

376
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,690
baby jay is really the up in the log odds you get from having the

377
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:53,940
value of the feature xj equals one set of the features exchange was zero and

378
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,510
much notice that

379
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,460
if you're evaluating this linear function

380
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,850
and you have an xj

381
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,560
to which is zero

382
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,020
you don't even need to

383
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,730
you don't need to do any multiplication because you just get something time zero zero

384
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,040
and so

385
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,170
girls incompleteness theorem

386
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:21,930
and if you don't you'll get some great articles google

387
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,240
there's plenty of lectures given the sort of course since for more details

388
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,260
every semester

389
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,200
i have

390
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,990
taken the trouble with a view of how these things go

391
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,370
on the web and you certainly find me

392
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,150
i recommend that you do that

393
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,050
still for the very detailed treatment and checking whether

394
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,850
as a colleague of mine a teacher of mine

395
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,780
but it if you want to know whether

396
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,740
you know at step seven hundred twenty one

397
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,880
inside this land really follows set step seven twenty

398
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:58,750
you know you need to go to the table like this have always assumptions clear

399
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,200
and so forth

400
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,660
that's amounts

401
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,280
can i just do some history now

402
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,340
talk about

403
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:10,110
the the historical background released this is just my sort take

404
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,170
in what was going on in the nineteen thirties so this is now

405
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,550
good luck

406
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,570
but going back even a little further to the turn of the century to the

407
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,610
twentieth century

408
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,020
the nineteen early nineteen hundreds when

409
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,270
as you probably know

410
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,740
a number of philosophers and mathematicians were attempting to

411
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:40,110
completely embed formerly our arithmetic in his mathematics in psychology

412
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,250
the most famous person ten was initially

413
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,150
it was a good called fraga got fraga

414
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,740
and he'd written a whole lot of work on this which

415
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,600
true to form now i could understand the beginning

416
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,250
simultaneously around the same time anyway

417
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,210
russell bertrand russell

418
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,230
in cambridge

419
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,120
i wrote the a book called cricket mathematica

420
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,600
in which they set out

421
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,540
what i hope to be

422
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,800
a complete

423
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:15,650
reconstruction of mathematics starting from the axioms of logic just what was effectively first order

424
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,110
and all went well for a very long time until you

425
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,500
probably we all know this kind of story backwards

426
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,710
russell discovered that internally in his system

427
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,210
there were paradoxical conclusions that

428
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,000
the set theory that he

429
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,650
maybe i'll discuss to that the

430
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,010
and here

431
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,590
well make it easy for you for six

432
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,320
well i forget my wiki

433
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,520
really intolerable

434
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,930
he russell discovered this internal

435
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,750
problem russells paradox is called tell frank about no

436
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,480
you in the right

437
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,240
fraga didn't believe it

438
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,120
and all sorts of problems were not so there is a big issue

439
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,720
another issue was over in which in mathematics with

440
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,330
very famous mathematician called hilbert

441
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,130
and hilbert was at the same time

442
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,370
but that that was packed that problem

443
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,800
can say that set theory power from the sort of packed

444
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:23,270
erica stabilising and work with something else we used to get right you

445
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:29,000
and hilbert was attempting to prove things left right and centre through what are called

446
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,850
ideal arguments

447
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,870
that is sort of large-scale reductio

448
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,030
if you want to show that some kind of algebra has a certain property

449
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,590
while has a certain particular object in the basis set

450
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,860
vectors for the algebra from the algebra from which you could reconstructed for instance

451
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,130
if you want to do that

452
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:55,370
cool well invent this construction is also will suppose there is no such thing

453
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:59,050
and i'll show that whole thing leads to contradictions that whole situation

454
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,320
no we actually build the object

455
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,210
in building mathematics heating exhibit the number

456
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,290
that's that was sort of quite worked tall people so this is on the next

457
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,500
slide here

458
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:19,270
hilbert along with others have proposed the complete axiomatisation of mathematics

459
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,490
he was

460
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,000
we see whatever myself

461
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:32,170
the methods the techniques that help used were had this kind of existential nature

462
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,540
i'll show that something doesn't exist so this leads to contradiction so after all must

463
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,850
exist because

464
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,680
the kind of thing seemed contradiction fair enough

465
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,360
but that really did run counter to a lot of mathematicians intuitions

466
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,630
in this particular example here

467
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,490
mathematician called go down

468
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,630
who had

469
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,570
complained about this proof

470
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,260
that a certain sort of algebras had basis

471
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,840
so well that's not mathematics that's just

472
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,400
you know actually building you

473
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,280
constructing something and i guess that constructive

474
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,130
the idea

475
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:11,130
in mathematics is really inherit from geometry really starts

476
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,590
from the same thing as we all learned in school

477
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:16,860
let's see what we can do for a given the triangle let's take the triangle

478
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,110
and the lines that he lines out there

479
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,750
let's compare angles where constructing

480
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,500
so that sort of stuff my

481
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:29,220
a lot of sense to london the moving into this existential round didn't seem right

482
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,610
proposed that

483
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,990
we might try and get around this

484
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,670
you can see the criticism

485
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,930
it wasn't much moved by he said

486
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,460
well maybe you are trying to prove something like this

487
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,840
well point happens in these things

488
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,620
suppose there is some property phi

489
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,630
that i can prove in my ideal role

490
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,100
OK what you guys are worried about is that might not be provable in the

491
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,400
real world the real world of constructive finitistic methods mathematics

492
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,880
so what about i prove

493
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,770
super theorem around

494
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,710
this says

495
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,470
but everything i can prove my ideal existential approach is going to work in the

496
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,610
real world

497
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,910
in the real world

498
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,150
as you call

499
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,350
and this was proposed quite seriously it was a big program work

500
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,630
i spend a lot of time trying to classify what the real role was going

501
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,780
to make it very very small

502
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,460
k very simple

503
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:33,540
so the result would be correspondingly more exciting and strong

504
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:38,930
this was the context of all the work that we're about to talk about

505
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:44,000
the next part of this little these next few slides i

506
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,960
somehow failed to put in my little proof that

507
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,660
just use of the network generates something like twenty five about

508
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:57,040
one of them is possible for is actually responsible for

509
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:05,870
doing all this stuff we talked about before cleaning and all the good stuff dealing

510
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,830
with service don't respond all the

511
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,520
parcels of pragmatic

512
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,660
and then produces

513
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:20,610
targeting abilities produces insights into our users of these products have approved products which products

514
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,240
to invest in which stipulates

515
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,840
it's really a legal right it's it's

516
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,550
it's the space

517
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,880
typically use commercial databases because they don't scale you have to

518
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,300
build your own

519
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,100
optimized for that purpose

520
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:44,160
so it's pretty impressive challenge actually and i learned a lot from it

521
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,020
so that you use

522
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,520
i would like to

523
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,720
the four numbers numbers changed much

524
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:55,060
the distributions of the same internet sixteen percent but this is when you ask people

525
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,310
spend their time

526
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,830
online analysis is a bit about

527
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,880
the business side of the channel

528
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,210
that's roughly

529
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:07,220
in today's numbers about sixteen seventy percent of the time on internet

530
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,510
so the time is on

531
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:12,260
traditional media remember ten years ago there was

532
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,470
so the number was still

533
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:21,480
a lot of time spent things like newspapers magazines and TV shrinking in favor of

534
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,530
you ask another question which right

535
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,130
business of this which is this is what meant

536
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,050
well the advertisers dollars

537
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,640
and you know it is there is a very this can

538
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,410
i even though

539
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,640
hispanic something like six percent sixteen percent of the time on the internet in numbers

540
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:44,480
only about ten percent of the dollars go online

541
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,960
so this ship it's going to happen

542
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,270
it's it's

543
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,140
enough to

544
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,970
right advertisers who spending time

545
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,290
and eventually

546
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:59,130
you know without any of the online companies doing anything that mark is going to

547
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,500
i mean it

548
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,680
as we decided to get

549
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,970
the power of interactive media

550
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,620
that slice of the pie would actually grow

551
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,620
much more dramatic meeting people actually spend more time

552
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,360
and i believe internet will actually take more

553
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,130
index j

554
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,150
of advertising dollars why

555
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,830
because i give you some examples

556
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:21,650
but it's

557
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,400
in my opinion is one of the most powerful

558
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,020
marketing vehicles

559
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:31,650
because it does a lot more than others and now it's not

560
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,850
you always have to advertising

561
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,910
but what i'm trying to explain to you is that people have in the market

562
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,550
is really understood

563
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,420
how useful the internet can how to

564
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:50,530
so starting out i think about the internet business i started

565
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,460
asking somebody

566
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,010
naive questions like

567
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,440
what the advertisers what it so a simplified case

568
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:03,290
it is you for the top we all awareness which is when you

569
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,620
so that's just to make somebody where the company exists you have a problem

570
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,880
and the final is sort of the robot

571
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,660
i purchased you get consumers actually selected products

572
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,850
over the years continued to

573
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,160
now i think i

574
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,880
as a lot about this business especially

575
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,930
it's definitely in

576
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,100
has business about a billion dollar business problems

577
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,790
which is a graphical

578
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,490
those are designed to create awareness talk about

579
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,720
we also have a significant business

580
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,440
which is almost a million dollars

581
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,620
at the bottom

582
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,610
which is more direct marketing

583
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,210
that's the search advertising

584
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,160
by the way businesses in the US alone are over two hundred million that actually

585
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,260
marketing is over two hundred fifty billion just in the US

586
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,310
and on line of that money is only about

587
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,110
ten billion

588
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,010
so what

589
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,970
ten is about over two hundred million in the US brand advertising

590
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,380
that that's

591
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,020
it's the second all over the place

592
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,090
in the middle

593
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,790
well as marketers

594
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,850
so what

595
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:22,710
thank you

596
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,960
you established awareness but they didn't like

597
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,580
so that's called consideration

598
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,330
so is that the consumer spends most of the time

599
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,400
so was yes

600
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:37,360
said OK so what do we do with consumers into consideration phase

601
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,500
when i go

602
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,830
was blanked

603
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:46,510
don't actually have any solutions for people who are into consideration is which if you

604
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,630
think about it

605
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,990
is the majority

606
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,730
of the time

607
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,390
the majority of the

608
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,410
of your own life time spent in the middle of the middle of

609
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,780
imagine that this hopefully this time

610
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,540
the evolution of of life

611
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,170
this strategy and how we can become drive business

612
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,010
mister to start saying well if that's the most rich areas

613
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,880
one the working on ways

614
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,890
o two

615
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,510
and convince them to move up the

616
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,400
give you an example of that

617
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,920
finally go to market only think about convince them to move lower final into this

618
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,350
which in my opinion is going to make

619
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,470
well i'm not much much larger even

620
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,700
anybody that so all the

621
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,780
all of which it is not

622
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,970
and new ideas

623
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:42,600
so five minutes talking about data

624
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,290
and that's

625
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,190
he is

626
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,640
and after about

627
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,640
just interested in general some observations about the site

628
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,680
i mean that much

629
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,500
is getting a hell of a lot of tension

630
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,170
marketing dollars

631
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,560
microsoft has a search product if you know

632
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,800
search product most of you don't know

633
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,870
who has the search product is probably the only

634
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,570
that has the search problem

635
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,870
what about

636
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,920
because of its unique in one sense to me

637
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:34,130
and somebody has to find something that is right that interact

638
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:39,700
and when you something for for that moment in time i actually have a lnstitute

639
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,110
because they have a glimpse intent

640
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:45,100
i can manage to use

641
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,120
at about ten to hundred times that

642
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:54,050
that if i were to just do genetic sort of reaching out the math one

643
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:57,400
ten two hundred times better understand about two orders of magnitude

644
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,070
that difference

645
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,950
a lot

646
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,640
companies like ours

647
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,470
into the k

648
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,140
so for the ones that i for one for the ones that are equal to

649
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,420
to zero are not one minus and the then this is

650
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:13,130
the number of ways in which you can choose

651
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,980
OK among

652
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,490
and you have to some that

653
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,540
all the cases

654
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,050
o which

655
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,340
there are enough one

656
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:27,020
two by piece

657
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,540
i mean you can

658
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,530
prior to re write it down but

659
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,780
this is exactly

660
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:38,310
summing over all the cases for which this is true

661
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:46,030
looking at all possible number of ones in the sequence of zeros and ones

662
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,940
and actually i mean this is not necessarily easy to work with

663
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,180
and you can add values of bounds on this quantity

664
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,090
one of them being have been

665
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,710
again looking at the case zero one side of these being minus eight that they

666
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,600
had in the

667
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:09,580
but better than having you can have what is called bernstein's inequality

668
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:14,400
we're actually occurs in the in the same between

669
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,310
all of them

670
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,490
including this one and thing is that have been does not take into account

671
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,350
the probability that the losses is

672
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,440
zero one

673
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,790
it does not take into account the

674
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,760
this is one for any possible value of p and actually

675
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:36,390
the this kind of deviation is reached when is the worst which is one half

676
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,150
that's the worst case

677
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,150
but then when he is is dependent on how we can have better bounds

678
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,250
including this one standing which has

679
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,240
this key one minus factor

680
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:53,170
he one minus p turns out to be the violence of bernoulli random variables is

681
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,640
the variance of

682
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,650
these guys

683
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,850
we enter

684
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,470
these inequalities whereas does not enter here

685
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,080
bennett is another version of a slightly more refined version of

686
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,030
and you have also this exponential which is

687
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,830
yet another version and they are kind of

688
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:23,400
decreasing order of sharks so this one is the best because that's inequality this one

689
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,190
is slightly worse likely were slightly worse

690
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,490
even worse

691
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,910
you have exactly the words

692
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,420
it's a bit more work

693
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,570
this kind of thing if we look at these for example that we see that

694
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,290
there is here and here he is the size of the deviation

695
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,950
and we said before we have of gaussians kind of behavior

696
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,400
four things right where it the minus the squared kind of thing

697
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,280
here we see that

698
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,320
twenty small we need of the gaussians behaviour

699
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,420
when t is large then these terms

700
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,390
and then we have e to the minus

701
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:07,750
instead of into the minus the square which is much more but right much more

702
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:11,560
i mean decrease to zero much more slowly than e to the minus the square

703
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,360
we have the gumption behaviour

704
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:18,640
for small deviations multi

705
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:24,040
and these guys can deviation as corresponding virus you one be

706
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:28,200
and the light division we have actually what is called this last year

707
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,350
we have this e to the minus t

708
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,740
independent on the the the violence now he does not enter here anymore

709
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:40,490
so the terms are heavier than go

710
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,010
of course we can provide both cases

711
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,910
with the with the gumption was largely financed by this increase the the size of

712
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,130
the currently we can enclose what is but that bit

713
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,490
and this

714
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,830
how it looks

715
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,420
it's easy to see but within the next bout

716
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,150
these are the actual values of these are

717
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,140
computed with this some formula

718
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,360
and then you are all these about

719
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,830
the binomial

720
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:17,490
so for the binomial it this one that's the exact value than we

721
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,290
then bernstein green

722
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,550
well they are more-or-less equivalent

723
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,160
and this is for the worst case people

724
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:25,950
o point five

725
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,890
o point q or

726
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,560
for the worst case p

727
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,210
well the

728
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,270
you know most of them are

729
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,330
the same so i have these OK

730
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,440
so if you look at the case

731
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,800
even painter

732
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,880
if we look at the most cases like people is point one then

733
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,790
easy to see but

734
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,910
this is still

735
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,410
the exact values

736
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,580
and then

737
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:56,140
what is this

738
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,080
this one

739
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:00,270
you been which is

740
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,870
the subculture here

741
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:02,740
so that's

742
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,040
so i think the worst but then the other one and two because they take

743
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,490
into account the violence

744
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,480
they two

745
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,790
the closer to the actual values

746
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,460
and that's for the

747
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,450
kind of

748
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:19,030
small values of the deviation and if we look at the larger values we we

749
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,760
zoom in these

750
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,690
this week we're going to talk about cardiovascular physiology and the

751
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:32,430
cardiovascular system which includes the blood the blood vessels

752
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,290
and the heart

753
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,220
we're gonna

754
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,220
focus on several features this is obviously

755
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,150
a big topic not only understanding the basic

756
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:48,470
the physiology of the cardiovascular system but what can fail on the cardiovascular system in

757
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:54,340
disease and cause cardiovascular disease is the number one or two cause of death

758
00:42:54,360 --> 00:43:00,200
in the western world and so it's it's a serious and important topic for medicine

759
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,050
and it's also something that i realised you probably all know something about

760
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:08,830
and so we're going to try to look at things in a slightly different way

761
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:14,040
to look at them the way that engineer biomedical engineer might look at the cardiovascular

762
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:22,320
system to try to understand the relationships in particular between pressure

763
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:28,650
blood pressure which is the force that moves blood around the circulatory system and flow

764
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:34,630
the actual movement of blood which is what's essential for distributing oxygen and nutrients and

765
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:39,470
everything else that we know that we that we move around in our circulatory system

766
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:43,900
so i'm going to talk briefly about the anatomy of the heart and circulatory system

767
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,980
will start by thinking about the whole

768
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,790
i'm going to talk in some detail about about how

769
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:57,160
differences generate flow in starting with a very simple

770
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,870
and building up to some of the complexity that we have within our cardiovascular systems

771
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,250
and one of the most amazing things about the cardiovascular system is its ability

772
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,920
to change

773
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,750
the pattern of blood flow

774
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:16,550
such that organs that need more blood can get more blood

775
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:21,410
it's not just that there is a static system where blood is flowing throughout the

776
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:25,620
body and flows at the same rate everywhere all the time it increases in one

777
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:32,660
region decreases another in response to physiological medium we'll talk about that sort of engineering

778
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,750
that the that the cardiovascular system uses to accomplish that

779
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:43,270
and then the next week we'll talk about what will talk in some detail this

780
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:48,570
thursday about how the heart generates the pressure is needed to move the blood and

781
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:52,570
how you can create this flow with the relatively simple

782
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,570
but durable machine the heart

783
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:00,000
and the next tuesday will talk about

784
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:07,380
cardiac conduction electrophysiology how the how the heart regulates its it's beating in order to

785
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,950
generate orderly pattern of pressure

786
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:15,390
a generation

787
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:22,010
so this is a cartoon of the cardiovascular system not showing the blood except by

788
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:26,670
the colors here but showing the heart in the centre of this diagram is the

789
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:33,660
and surrounding it is sort of a schematic diagram like you might see for plumbing

790
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:39,660
in in house but certainly not in anatomical detail this drawing isn't of how blood

791
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,040
flows from the heart

792
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,720
to all the other regions of the body

793
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,730
and let's just now i know that you that you that you've seen diagrams like

794
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:54,030
this before you understand the basic connections between things but let's just go through them

795
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:59,420
briefly and you have to start somewhere because this is a sick it's it's a

796
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:03,570
closed system right started one point and you go around and you come back to

797
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,650
the beginning and end and so

798
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,770
if we start

799
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,370
in the

800
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,170
in this side of the heart

801
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,060
this is the left side of the heart

802
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:18,260
and there are two chambers on the left side of the heart the adrian

803
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,580
and the ventricles

804
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,750
and you see the blood flows into the left side of the heart is coming

805
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,180
from the lungs the blood has come from the lungs and so it's full of

806
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:31,760
oxygen and this diagram is indicated is red and if you follow the arrows

807
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:35,260
here the blood flows from the lungs into the left adrian

808
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:36,820
into the left ventricle

809
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:37,790
and out

810
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,100
through a large vessel called the order

811
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,990
because so a fairly simple

812
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:49,160
so far two chambers in the heart blood flows through these two chambers

813
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:51,060
first then ventricle

814
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,030
and out

815
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:57,170
through the aorta so if i was able to measure flow

816
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,240
at this point here in the order

817
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,280
i would measure the total

818
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,160
the rate of flow of blood out of the heart

819
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,600
this is linear algebra r

820
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,500
lecture nine

821
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:13,600
and this is a key lecturer this is where we

822
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:18,570
get these ideas of

823
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:24,120
linear independence when a bunch of actors are independent

824
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,330
or dependent that's the opposite

825
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,150
of the space they span

826
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,760
a basis for subspace

827
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:37,310
the basis for a vector space that's the central idea

828
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,660
the dimension of that subspace

829
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:47,520
this is the day that those words get assigned clear meanings

830
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,690
and emphasise that we talk about

831
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,940
a bunch of actors being independent

832
00:47:54,950 --> 00:48:00,090
i wouldn't talk about matrix being independent a bunch of actors being independent a bunch

833
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:04,180
of vectors spanning the space a bunch of actors

834
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,100
being a basis

835
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,230
and the dimension

836
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,630
is some number

837
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:14,680
OK so what are the definitions can i begin with the fact

838
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,020
a highly important fact that

839
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,410
i didn't

840
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,790
call directly attention to

841
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,790
suppose i have a matrix

842
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,430
i look at a x equals zero

843
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,680
suppose the matrix has a lot of columns

844
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,100
so that

845
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,900
and is bigger than and so i'm looking at an equations

846
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:45,540
i'm sorry and equations a small number of equations and

847
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:50,600
and more unknowns i have more unknowns than equations

848
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:54,400
let me write that down more unknowns than equation

849
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:59,740
unknown axes

850
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,510
then equations

851
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:09,800
then the conclusion is that

852
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:13,430
there's something in the null space of a

853
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,150
what other than just the zero vector

854
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,710
the conclusion is are some non-zero

855
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:28,200
so a x is zero there are some special solutions and why we know why

856
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:32,390
i mean it's sort of like seems like a reasonable thing

857
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,270
more unknowns than equations

858
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:42,020
then it seems reasonable that we can solve them but we have a clear algorithm

859
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:47,640
which starts with the system and does elimination

860
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:51,430
gets the thing into an echelon form

861
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,120
with some

862
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,700
and pivot columns

863
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:01,960
and possibly some free columns i don't have pivots and the point is here there

864
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:07,830
will be some three columns the reason so the reason is

865
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:10,300
there must be there will be

866
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,780
three variables

867
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,090
a least one

868
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,180
that's the reason

869
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:27,490
we we now have the complete

870
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:33,530
algorithm complete systematic way to say OK we take this is the matrix equals zero

871
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,960
we roll reduce

872
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:40,620
we identify the free variables and since there are n variables

873
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,360
and at most m pivot

874
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,530
there will be

875
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:49,670
some free variables at least one at least n minus and in fact left over

876
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,460
and those variables i can assign

877
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:55,020
non-zero values two

878
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,150
i don't have to set those zero i can take them to be one or

879
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,330
whatever i like

880
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,550
and then i can solve for the pivot variables

881
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:06,460
so that gives me this is the solution to a single zero

882
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:10,430
and it's the solution that isn't all zeros

883
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,810
crew that

884
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:17,590
the important point that will use now

885
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:19,020
in this

886
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,280
so now i want to say what does it mean

887
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:27,470
for a bunch of vectors to be independent OK

888
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,140
so this is like

889
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,960
the background that we know

890
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:33,410
now i want to speak about independence

891
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,600
let's see

892
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,730
i can give you the

893
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,980
the the

894
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:50,210
abstract definition i will

895
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,150
but i would also like to give you

896
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,590
the direct meaning when

897
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,360
the question is when

898
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:09,460
x two up to support i am n vectors

899
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,530
now i have to give you

900
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:20,130
or linearly independent

901
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,960
i'll all often just say

902
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:24,480
and right independent for short

903
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,070
if OK

904
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:31,520
let me give you the full definition these are the vectors in some vector space

905
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:33,960
i can take combinations of them

906
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,920
the question is

907
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,660
do any combinations gives zero

908
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:44,090
if some combination of those factors gives the zero vector

909
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,970
other than the combination of all zeros

910
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,000
then they are dependent

911
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,070
they're independent if no

912
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:01,790
the zero vector

913
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:06,770
and then i have all have to put in an example

914
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:15,700
combination so what do i mean by that

915
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:22,960
no combination gives the zero vector any combination c one x one plus the two

916
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,910
x two class one class c and x and

917
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,440
is not zero

918
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,650
except for the zero combination this is when all

919
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,110
the city's

920
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,330
all this these are

921
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,810
then of course

922
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:50,460
so so pivots means not zero whereas if I had only see this 1

923
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,490
continue mentally

924
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:58,020
heavily for me just what we were doing this so that's 1 of the pivotal

925
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,720
B 3

926
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:03,420
well the 1st derivatives of 1

927
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,360
and then what's the 2nd pivot for B 3 also

928
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:16,130
apart faster you're giving the want OK the 2nd parameter that once and I believe

929
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,410
the 3rd pivot is a 1 also

930
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:23,610
that ensure that because the product of the pivot is that determinant

931
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:30,480
that the way you refuse to talk about this and the determine element in the

932
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,680
right place now I'm looking here is what I show is where sorry yeah the

933
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,980
benefits are 1

934
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:44,350
and 1 and 1 3rd rate goes down I just believe right and I'll come

935
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:53,180
what is the pivotal this when the do these pivots all correctly 1 of the

936
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:58,550
pivot for that matrix as well as you said 1 and then 1 and then

937
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:01,270
0 which I don't accept

938
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:06,460
so I think I'll so the parents are well I never figured out how to

939
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:11,370
try to do the pivots are 1 and 1 and I'm willing to write 0

940
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,880
what can I put

941
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:20,960
will just a blank or something OK because I don't know I will call that's

942
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:26,180
OK and now what can we do the payments for this 1

943
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:32,590
well we can start anyway what's what's the 1st

944
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,240
to and what's the 2nd pivot

945
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:41,160
3 halves

946
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,630
well we didn't here

947
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,680
we got the 3 halves here and actually

948
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,610
this matrix starts the same way

949
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:56,920
so and when you're finally the pivots if you know if you're looking for the

950
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:01,370
2nd have all you need to know is that part of the 2nd derivative is

951
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:07,690
3 halves and actually the next experiment will turn out to be 4 thirds and

952
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:12,270
the next 10 but after that would be 5 4 and 6 and so on

953
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:17,570
have the fond of playing with these matrices between now and next

954
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:24,680
the cell templates are 204 this 3 by 3 the parameter 2 and 3 halves

955
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,640
and then the next 1 will be 4 thirds

956
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:32,090
I want to have mentioned where in the book

957
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:36,970
you might look for some some of so we so today's lecture is

958
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:48,660
most closely connected to section 1 . 2 in the applied maths but but

959
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:53,570
really what I guess I'm saying is you might look at some of these exercises

960
00:56:53,570 --> 00:57:01,110
in that section as sort of additional questions about it this this time OK

961
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,370
so we have the idea of elimination

962
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:14,890
I wanna say 1 more thing about elimination

963
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,090
that we got from the matrix

964
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:22,630
to the upper triangular 1 there was no problem

965
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:25,170
0 but then

966
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:29,470
I wanna get there with matrices

967
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,770
related cut the

968
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:35,810
the can't I mean if we have a large problem I can't like

969
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:42,770
list all the pivoting operations they want to fit information probably some matrix which we're

970
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,310
multiplying this by

971
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:47,870
to get

972
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:53,620
so that it can can you tell me what that so I want say OK

973
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,600
that was much too much riding on that 1

974
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:06,090
and just go from the made from 1 matrix to the other and not worry

975
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:11,350
about all about keeping up with the right hand side Matlab deals with the right

976
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:16,150
hand side later

977
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:21,350
so I'm going from this matrix and what I want to do is multiplied by

978
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:23,940
a suitable matrix

979
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,900
that produces the answer leaves the 1st row unchanged

980
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:33,980
tell me what the 1st row of this matrix out of the

981
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,900
if you I want to

982
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,540
multiply this is my

983
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:43,790
elimination matrix you could say this is my matrix that that does the step that

984
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:47,670
carried out in

985
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,710
what does well rather priorities you can already tell me what the 1st row has

986
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:54,850
to be

987
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:56,170
and it's

988
00:58:56,230 --> 00:59:01,980
1 0 that takes 1 of that role 0 that rose

989
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:06,520
what OK now what about the 2nd

990
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,420
OK the 2nd row was what did what did we do to get the new

991
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:16,250
2nd rows of the new 2nd row with 0 3 had

992
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,790
what what did we do

993
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:22,090
we took half of the 1st role

994
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:25,260
bless all of the 2nd row

995
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,060
so this is iYou're are elementary

996
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,500
will produce

997
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:42,380
that's OK

998
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,400
that's we're saying we're seeing at these were saying elimination carried out by military

999
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:55,270
I but the the beautiful place the beautiful way to describe it is that

1000
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:59,270
what that over on the other side

1001
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,850
and have k equal something

1002
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,120
so what I'm

1003
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:06,460
what I'm

1004
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,850
saying here is that the key ideas of linear algebra

1005
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:16,540
so this is not solved part

1006
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,210
can tell you linear algebra hearing impairment in that small space

1007
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:30,190
a slow but don't tell anybody it's so simple right and so the key idea

1008
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:34,270
of elimination so everything you do in linear algebra

1009
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:40,460
all the big operations elimination is the first one Gram Schmidt

1010
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,120
orthogonalization of vectors is another 1 eigen values is another 1 the singular value decomposition

1011
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:49,870
of the big 4

1012
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,400
and each of those is described by

1013
01:00:53,480 --> 01:01:02,060
factorization as k equals breaking came down into a product of special

1014
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:09,870
and I'm going to speak for the moment about the elimination

1015
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:18,520
and the usual way the elimination is as l times

1016
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:23,100
lower triangular times upper triangular let's get let's do that

1017
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:28,510
so can we get to that did you see what's we have the k

1018
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:32,460
and we have the

1019
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:38,900
what 1 has isn't ready here is that I've got the on this side and

1020
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,380
I wanna move over to be an L

1021
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,480
on that side is that alright so so I'm just going to take that and

1022
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,140
this is very intriguing because again the only difference was the fact this was the

1023
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:53,850
the other thing that we found is just this is qualitatively different sense of the

1024
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:59,100
emotional relationship that people have with the robot people would name the robot is examples

1025
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,070
of the names of people give to the robot

1026
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:06,780
they were close happens starts with personalized and it turns out that we can pick

1027
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:09,630
up the robot a lot of people come out to the car and say goodbye

1028
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,260
to the robot

1029
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:16,720
they did not do this with the computer

1030
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:20,950
so again this is something very evocative going on here

1031
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:25,590
so the last little bit then i want to talk about is totally another related

1032
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:32,820
the robots just as a communication medium in the cell can grow by being intriguing

1033
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,260
way to help people

1034
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,470
communicate mediated

1035
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:38,220
the robot

1036
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:41,950
so why is it interesting what we know if you look at human human face

1037
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:45,570
to face interaction the body place a profound role

1038
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:50,470
in being able to make eye contact touch partial changes sharing this with

1039
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:53,650
all of these things that we don't get the result we don't get to scrap

1040
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,840
don't give you any other kind communication technologies that we have today

1041
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,400
you get ask maybe with these teleconferencing system that you don't get out you really

1042
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:06,440
don't get good eye contact so really robot because of body in your space

1043
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,720
could potentially really be the next best thing

1044
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:13,590
two really being is intriguing to think about robots themselves as communication medium

1045
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:16,010
and i think one very intriguing idea

1046
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:21,010
is to really think about robots as potentially a distance learning technology

1047
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:22,820
especially for very young

1048
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,670
children so

1049
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,760
we know there increasing data showing that

1050
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:33,630
it's critical for the learning in the first five years of age to prepare children

1051
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:38,380
for kindergarten and so forth and that if you start kindergarten behind you tend to

1052
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:43,300
stay behind so in some sense you can imagine anyone so distracted takes improving our

1053
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:47,180
our student product at the end of the twelfth grade be to improve the product

1054
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:52,240
going into kindergarten so really starting think deeply about how my technologies play a role

1055
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:57,200
in early childhood education i think is really critical really interesting and i think robots

1056
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,010
have a very special role because if you think of the way that young children

1057
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:04,180
learn so children five years of age and maybe around five they might be willing

1058
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:07,940
to abide the computer but not necessarily want to spend hours sitting behind a computer

1059
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,650
children even younger than that

1060
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:15,030
i mean they learn from physical presence social interaction social scaffolding and that's the main

1061
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,590
i have three young children four years and younger i know the fact that there's

1062
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:22,260
a lot of time as a lot of icon there's a lot of sources covers

1063
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,950
a lot of interaction how children learn and i think robots can be very tricky

1064
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:30,570
technology by which an adult could essentially jack into a robot to provide the same

1065
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:35,380
kinds of learning interactions the bring into children who would necessarily how those interactions otherwise

1066
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,420
or to you know to to tell the second language so there's a whole bunch

1067
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,650
of things i think we can look at

1068
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:43,280
so why robot will again

1069
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,650
we're designing a robot over here you can see the huggable

1070
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:49,490
it looks like a q teddy bear

1071
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:54,820
really it's very sophisticated robots twenty cameras in the i microphones and here's speaker in

1072
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:58,970
the mouth of full-body sensitive skin is being developed to the robot consensus being tickled

1073
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:03,700
had touched insofar as inertial measurement units the the revenues has been carried down there's

1074
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,950
a computer inside of wireless communication

1075
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:12,200
and there's a degrees of freedom for expression through gesture facial expression as well be

1076
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,860
able to share attention so again trying to make this is this is socially situated

1077
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:22,030
at communication technology as possible and again the core ideas through the internet from anywhere

1078
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:25,820
in the world potentially an adult can go through a web interface to jack into

1079
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:27,630
that's with

1080
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:31,990
child that you can share story together you could play together you can do language

1081
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:35,530
when you get do many many different kinds of activities so again really about bringing

1082
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:37,840
people together mediated through

1083
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:43,820
a robot so i want to do another demonstration living dangerously today we try to

1084
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:44,840
live demo

1085
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,570
i really do that

1086
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:13,420
i have gone

1087
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:23,130
i today

1088
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,550
we can only be people

1089
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,420
all right so we have a little bit of

1090
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:39,420
the people of interface

1091
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,070
so this is what you can see here that the yellow box is the field

1092
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:43,740
of view

1093
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:47,530
like from the video camera behind the ball in the box basically work

1094
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:51,470
alan you the operator can use to direct the gaze of the robot as drive

1095
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:55,150
box around this time he was in the there to be able to track the

1096
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:58,820
object to eye contact to look at the attention of objects that you want to

1097
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:02,440
you also have the virtual model of the

1098
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:05,110
here that's running out if you want to be

1099
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:08,950
able to be here

1100
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:10,780
the one

1101
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,610
but i was working

1102
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:16,450
OK so you can see the interface here

1103
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:19,130
and i don't know if they have not been able to use the head

1104
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:20,570
one that

1105
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:27,880
all right then i want to give up some information

1106
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:31,950
there is an animation so as an operating in about a lot of different gestures

1107
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:33,280
and expressions

1108
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:36,280
with the remaining place themselves

1109
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:40,700
OK as a sort of the notion of expressive sounds as well

1110
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,670
so this is currently in in development energy you want to show the wearable

1111
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:48,380
interface you can to control the there

1112
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:50,330
so as

1113
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:53,100
we're going on with our definitions

1114
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:59,490
return summarize a lot of these

1115
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:02,380
definitions into an notation

1116
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,500
chemical location that will be very important

1117
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,650
so for instance

1118
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,460
if i'm talking about

1119
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,630
three moles of hydrogen

1120
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,340
and one bar hundred degrees celsius

1121
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,630
i'm not going to write

1122
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:19,880
given three moles of hydrogen and one part three

1123
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:22,810
but what i'm going to write it in

1124
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:27,990
compact notation you write like this three moles of hydrogen

1125
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:29,400
which is same

1126
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,740
one bar

1127
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:34,820
one of the results

1128
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:38,330
this notation gives you everything you need to know about the system

1129
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:40,000
how do the number of moles

1130
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,640
tells the phase

1131
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:44,120
it tells you what kind of molecule it is

1132
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,610
and gives you two

1133
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:49,430
you could have

1134
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:53,840
if i am on the temperature you have violent pressure

1135
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,440
this tells you everything

1136
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,860
i don't need to write it out in words

1137
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,970
and then if i want to

1138
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:03,980
tell you about a change of state or make this let's first of mixture

1139
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:05,440
suppose that i want to to that

1140
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:07,190
to give you an extra life

1141
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:11,950
this is a homogeneous system with two components like

1142
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,740
five moles of h two which is a liquid

1143
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:16,330
one bar

1144
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:20,190
twenty five degrees celsius us

1145
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:22,710
five more c h

1146
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,730
link where one bar

1147
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:33,150
twenty five degrees celsius

1148
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:36,370
after this describes roughly something that

1149
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:40,090
is fairly common commonplace it's hard to provide

1150
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:44,600
half water and half ethanol

1151
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,860
that describes

1152
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:47,570
the macroscopic systems

1153
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:53,170
you're missing out purity so will flavor molecules are going to

1154
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:55,990
but basically that's that's the home and homogeneity

1155
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,770
describe two component homogeneous

1156
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:02,150
then you can do all sorts of predictive

1157
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:04,040
and stuff with that

1158
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:07,440
all right

1159
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:09,840
festival sequences and now we want to show

1160
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,120
the notation how do we go from one equilibrium state light

1161
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:20,060
this describes to another equilibrium states

1162
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:26,740
so we take our tricolor basically just put equal sign

1163
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:30,630
people signed means

1164
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:33,380
so go from one to the other sort of talk

1165
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:36,180
three models of our three moles of hydrogen

1166
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:38,130
richard s

1167
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:39,610
five are

1168
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:43,800
and one hundred degrees celsius

1169
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:49,210
and which is nice problem is they so i'm not going to change something new

1170
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:50,950
you can do

1171
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:54,630
an expansion that's

1172
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:58,150
all right we can drop the pressure vines you go up

1173
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,280
i don't need to tell you the volume here because

1174
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:03,120
you've got enough information to tackle ryan

1175
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:06,420
number remorse stays is the same

1176
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:08,280
the closest

1177
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,620
as doesn't come out

1178
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:16,640
those against another pressures is less temperature is less than some sort of expansion on

1179
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:21,270
one equilibrium state to another equal signs

1180
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:22,710
go from this data that

1181
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:26,530
it's not a chemical reaction where we don't have an hour

1182
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:28,860
because we could go back to this

1183
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:31,810
back and forth between

1184
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:34,660
connected this means they are connected

1185
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:38,450
when i put this i have to tell you how they are connected to tell

1186
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:39,940
you that i had

1187
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:42,660
going to solve the problem for instance you want to know how much energy is

1188
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,250
going to get out from doing

1189
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,750
this expansion

1190
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:48,140
how much energy you out

1191
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:52,020
and how far you're going to be able to drive the car with this expansion

1192
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,460
so i'm going to tell you

1193
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,380
how you doing the expansion

1194
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:58,970
because that's going to tell you how much energy you're wasting

1195
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:01,770
during that expansion was back to the second law

1196
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:06,540
nothing is efficient you're always wasting energy into heat somewhere when you do

1197
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:09,890
the change involves mechanical change

1198
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:11,850
all right side to tell you the pattern

1199
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:16,210
and i go from one state to the other

1200
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:20,240
and the pattern is going to be the sequence intermediate states going from the initial

1201
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,840
state final state

1202
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,580
so for instance if i draw graphs

1203
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:29,400
of pressure on one axis

1204
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:32,370
and temperature axes

1205
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:33,990
my initial state

1206
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:36,530
is that the temperature of a degrees

1207
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:41,710
and five bar

1208
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:44,000
that will be used in the

1209
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,730
the pattern discovery

1210
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:50,910
what is important is that there is a constraint OK these descriptors are exactly this

1211
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:54,040
subset of these descriptors

1212
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:58,040
or can belong to the set of this we can define the with the background

1213
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,060
knowledge so

1214
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:05,460
they can they can belong to do to this difference

1215
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:07,620
the but

1216
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,830
knowledge is defined as the tool

1217
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:11,830
link with there's some

1218
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:17,460
no on the believe it is provided by gets for example for example in close

1219
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:23,000
relation and the case that agent original relation between two objects is made to order

1220
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:30,960
for reflexivity properties close to exceed say on x y x y indicates that close

1221
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,100
to y axis just before symmetry

1222
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:40,520
what i am looking in this case we deal with the is a hierarchy of

1223
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:47,250
needs to moment and can define the following code i could be specifying going to

1224
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:50,170
happen and the set of all

1225
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:58,040
the child of these little evidence on which is the syntax we to represent the

1226
01:13:58,210 --> 01:13:59,660
i ching

1227
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:06,190
OK so there are threshold can be defined the that that they found for example

1228
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:11,000
in the case of the decision rules are treating the support and confidence of the

1229
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:15,850
traditional school in this case we have the name of the parameters that to uconn

1230
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:22,660
went to specify the keywords threshold and the idea that is associated to these

1231
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:24,890
fish crucial to

1232
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:31,480
are there are some i would to require some sort of bias in the hypothesis

1233
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:37,160
space and in this case we can use some specific critique networks to explore these

1234
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:43,540
spaces so we can specify a preference christina and so minimize maximize income and minimize

1235
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:49,580
the number of an example money money maximizes one and so on and it's possible

1236
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:54,560
to specify the value some tolerance as in this case

1237
01:14:54,560 --> 01:15:00,810
OK for an example of what are we we use it is the system is

1238
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:02,410
the math but to

1239
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:07,710
we have to install it in the system and is a mark of a part

1240
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:16,310
of that is so its surrounding being elephant even from tree and OK the effrontery

1241
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:23,770
is the parties crossing the south so the silent out of blue

1242
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:29,140
the blob in this image or in this case the

1243
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:36,540
task to allocate is too low an operational definition of the concept of landscape that

1244
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:43,290
one to landscape as recognised as a sign that is characterized by these are

1245
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:48,870
landscape that associated with the presence of the valley and the valleys these OK i

1246
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:53,620
can learn to operational future for this concept then they can use these operational definition

1247
01:15:53,670 --> 01:16:00,710
to query newmark in this case the expert acidic recognised this allows positive examples of

1248
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:05,670
landscape y and we say that to some other examples that are negative

1249
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:11,790
some other sizes are negative examples for these specific

1250
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:16,960
concept and this is the key to have formulated in this case we select on

1251
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,170
the side of the market the nineteenth of of the month and we intend to

1252
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:27,980
mine classification we did this battery morphological and so for the class landscape quite to

1253
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:36,160
same we use these descriptors for generating the discrete description of all the cell cell

1254
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:41,690
actin and can specify this script the same descriptors so that should be used in

1255
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:47,440
the mining step in the first example we have and background knowledge and the defence

1256
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:52,000
secretary will be was that they are specified you are in this case the mining

1257
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,890
is performed with the operating system

1258
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:59,930
while especially

1259
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,790
but it's a relation that can be extracted from one

1260
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:10,080
the data in its and so the

1261
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:15,330
here the extension to their actual line triangulation it is most but i must be

1262
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:19,440
equal to the distance and so on through

1263
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:27,060
we are seeing with descriptors so we can specify the set of character that should

1264
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:32,390
be effectively used in the mining sector and in this case that in this way

1265
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:33,300
so the

1266
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:34,630
average velocity

1267
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,370
during this for second trip

1268
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,730
it's zero

1269
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:40,410
you may not like that

1270
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:42,400
it may go against intuition

1271
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:43,390
of course

1272
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:46,570
i couldn't agree more issues but that's the way we define velocity

1273
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:52,700
speed is defined differently speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector

1274
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:57,510
and the speed therefore always has a positive value and i'll show you know what

1275
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:01,570
is the average speed

1276
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,260
zero and four

1277
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:09,670
that is the distance that it has trebled in these four seconds

1278
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:14,150
but first goal for the first second it goes from policy six two plus three

1279
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:15,630
so it already travels

1280
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,630
three metres

1281
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:21,760
then in the second second it goes from plus three to minus three so we

1282
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:24,680
one hundred six meters

1283
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:26,400
and then in the thirty seconds

1284
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:30,180
it's lazy it doesn't do anything so

1285
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:31,930
the distance traveled is zero

1286
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:35,070
and then in the last one second gets very active

1287
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,860
and it travels nine metres

1288
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:43,560
note issues OEC plus signs here and all minus signs it would make no sense

1289
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:44,660
and this

1290
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:47,190
cos in four seconds

1291
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:49,950
so that is

1292
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:51,500
four and a half

1293
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:57,450
meters per second for the average speed is four and a half meters per second

1294
01:18:57,510 --> 01:18:59,780
but the average velocity

1295
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:02,930
is zero

1296
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:04,560
we could now

1297
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:06,090
make a plot

1298
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:08,140
of the

1299
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,880
as a function of time

1300
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,250
let me put here

1301
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:16,100
four and a half

1302
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:18,710
but i just have enough room here

1303
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:21,860
to make the velocity plot

1304
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:23,240
as a function of time

1305
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:24,980
making new ones

1306
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:28,930
this is my time axis

1307
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:32,880
and this

1308
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,050
the velocity

1309
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:40,380
one second

1310
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:41,670
two second

1311
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,590
three seconds

1312
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:46,220
four seconds

1313
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,610
this velocity is in meters

1314
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:53,480
per second

1315
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:55,130
i go up here

1316
01:19:56,940 --> 01:20:00,580
plus ten

1317
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,080
minus five

1318
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:08,450
use minus six

1319
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,740
so what do i do now i know that the

1320
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:13,320
velocity during the first second

1321
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,420
minus sixteen

1322
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:17,060
for linear

1323
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:21,730
and so the during the first second

1324
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,650
this is the

1325
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:30,890
as a function of time it started zero you can see that

1326
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:34,630
and when it is here it has the velocity of minus six meters

1327
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:37,070
the second

1328
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,400
during the second

1329
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:43,340
second it remains minus six meters per second

1330
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,900
during the second second

1331
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:51,120
the velocity is not changing

1332
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,320
it stays there

1333
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,190
during the third second

1334
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:57,310
the velocity

1335
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:01,530
john all of a sudden two zero you see how non-physical

1336
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:05,670
so all of a sudden during the thirty seconds it becomes zero

1337
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:09,940
it has to somehow connection of course between the two to make the physical

1338
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:13,130
so in a very small amount of time that will have to occur

1339
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:17,860
that's why you get a huge acceleration at that point

1340
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:22,260
she also get an acceleration here at this point because there's also change in velocity

1341
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,840
and then during the four seconds

1342
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:27,730
the velocities plus nine meters per second

1343
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:31,730
and so we jump up

1344
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:32,640
it is

1345
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:41,880
and so

1346
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:43,900
we have here

1347
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:45,500
during the last second

1348
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:47,390
and again this is not physical

1349
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:48,790
it has to be somehow

1350
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:50,760
the transition

1351
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,240
so here you see

1352
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,870
the velocity as a function of time

1353
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:57,530
now comes an interesting question

1354
01:21:57,570 --> 01:21:59,400
is it possible

1355
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:01,660
so if i gave you this

1356
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:03,370
but this is a given

1357
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:04,890
you can see that

1358
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:08,100
could you convert this back to that

1359
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,580
and the answer is yes

1360
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,540
but i tell you what the position is

1361
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:16,310
t zero at t equals zero

1362
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:22,400
and that is sufficient for you

1363
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,150
to use this information

1364
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:27,790
kind of idea this afternoon in my lecture but

1365
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:32,810
the idea is very simple start off again with the set of all hypotheses and

1366
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:38,680
while there is more than one viable hypotheses you select that just any

1367
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:43,570
unlabelled feature for query but the one that's going to be in some sense maximally

1368
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:49,090
maximally informative so what if are my hypotheses again our plus one minus one valued

1369
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:53,670
by trying to find an exit minimizes the absolute value of the sum of all

1370
01:22:53,670 --> 01:23:00,730
the hypotheses responses if that's if the value of this this absolute sum is zero

1371
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:02,190
means half saying

1372
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:07,220
plus one after a minus one and so that would eliminate the largest fraction at

1373
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:08,340
each time

1374
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:14,960
find query for which is the most disagreement among current hypotheses aquarium at that point

1375
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:18,390
and then again you just reduce the hypothesis space so this is just a bit

1376
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:23,280
more aggressive than the callout for them in that callista taking any

1377
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:28,450
query for example that there was some disagreement on this our trying to pick the

1378
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:31,360
one where there's this maximal disagreement

1379
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:35,030
and there's quite a bit you can say about this type of algorithm talk about

1380
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:36,960
that afternoon

1381
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:41,880
OK so just a little bit about what some flavours of active learning and analysis

1382
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:47,760
there's many different ways you might vision using this one is query synthesis where you

1383
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,470
can actually construct

1384
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:53,740
desire queries or questions to this would be one one case here would be suppose

1385
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:59,490
you could design experimental conditions to see what happens if i set various variables in

1386
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:04,320
my experiment to some value what's the response that the outcome of experiment so in

1387
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,910
many cases like that we can actually designed queries

1388
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:11,970
pool based active learning would be a situation where you have a whole

1389
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,290
a large collection of unlabelled examples and you can

1390
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:23,630
selectively picked examples from that pool for labeling and stream based approaches are what i

1391
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:25,290
was talking about a moment ago with

1392
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:29,900
OK now we monitor stream of unlabelled examples as they come along and if you

1393
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:35,770
find unlabelled example at some point the uncertainty your request label otherwise i'll skip over

1394
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:40,500
it just wait for another more uncertain case

1395
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:41,950
and then there are

1396
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,490
ways of trying to

1397
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:50,350
quantify how many unlabeled examples are queries you're going to need i'm not going to

1398
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:54,590
say too much about this but from the query learning literature there's something known as

1399
01:24:54,590 --> 01:25:01,600
extended teaching dimension which is sort of a combinatorial parameter that relates the hypothesis query

1400
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:08,040
space there's no notion of the disagreement coefficient which which measures the growth of the

1401
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:14,290
region of disagreement this region in feature space where the hypothesis are disagreeing and then

1402
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:20,560
there's the neighbourly condition which is more geometric relationship between the feature space in the

1403
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,940
hypothesis space which i'll talk about this afternoon

1404
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:28,920
so what if there is noise mismatch or just a couple things and that first

1405
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,950
of all if there's no is how become noise tolerant there are

1406
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,450
a number of ways of approaching this i'm just going to talk about a few

1407
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:41,920
generic lines one way to deal with noise is to come up with service stochastic

1408
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:47,470
notion of the version space and here we would consider all hypotheses that could be

1409
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:53,650
explained by just noise alone so you can imagine i have a bunch of hypotheses

1410
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:58,470
and after selecting some data may maybe none of them are perfect but some of

1411
01:25:58,470 --> 01:26:00,550
them could be explained away just by

1412
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:03,670
random noise like here's another is really couldn't be

1413
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:08,350
explain that way they're just more systematically wrong

1414
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:13,410
the second kind of approach would be repeated squaring maybe you could run the procedure

1415
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:18,170
like an hour this generalized binary search and every time you make query you just

1416
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:21,940
repeat that same query a number of times until you're very sure

1417
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:27,070
of what the correct label should be in that case and then finally there are

1418
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:33,460
ways of serving waiting your hypotheses as in accordance with how well they predicted on

1419
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:39,680
the features and examples you've seen so far and to put more weight on the

1420
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:44,460
ones that seem to be performing better unless we don't others and that's that's sort

1421
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,680
a more gentle way of

1422
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:51,540
of handling this kind of idea for stochastic version space

1423
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:55,690
so that's noise and we'll talk a lot about some of the

1424
01:26:55,770 --> 01:27:00,550
the next part is about specific examples of how to deal with that another issue

1425
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:02,380
is this

1426
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:04,790
the fact that active learning is greedy

1427
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:08,020
and it can be a bit myopic and converge to

1428
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:11,260
things missed things overlook things and so forth so what do you do

1429
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:17,020
particularly if h stars ninety eight so that class of all the hypotheses are concerned

1430
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:20,470
so when we had do to make this point so

1431
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:23,050
active learning

1432
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:25,460
he is using your idea

1433
01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:29,820
and the structure of your space of hypotheses in order to guide how it's like

1434
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:35,960
samples so they can discriminate among the hypotheses are entertaining if you start off with

1435
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:41,450
the wrong with the model is incorrect suppose you're assuming a linear separator type of

1436
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:48,320
classifiers hyperplane classifier but the actual decision boundaries much more complicated you could actually end

1437
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:53,160
up staring yourself in in very bad direction and converging to a suboptimal

1438
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:56,200
linear separator even though there is

1439
01:27:56,250 --> 01:28:00,530
presumably some linear separator which is the best among all linear separators so how do

1440
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:06,400
you avoid this issue this is what's called agnostic active learning so if h stars

1441
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:11,730
not in the collection of hypotheses are considering making new least guarantee performance equal to

1442
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:15,460
that of passive learning and there are a lot of

1443
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:19,370
different ways you might achieve this i'm is going to have suggested one this

1444
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:24,950
relatively simple and in general the idea would be to split your sample budget into

1445
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:29,850
three parts one third of the data you would use some active learning modes serve

1446
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,480
aggressive way of collecting information

1447
01:28:32,710 --> 01:28:36,720
is another thirty totally passively so you get two

1448
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:45,100
hypothesis one from the aggressive active procedure one from the underground non-aggressive passive procedure and

1449
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:49,840
then use the final third of your samples to discriminate among those to see which

1450
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:53,750
of these two is better by just sampling in the region of disagreement between those

1451
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:59,410
two hypotheses and you can show that procedure like this will tend to give you

1452
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:01,120
the performance

1453
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:06,670
of active learning that serve enhanced performance whenever it star is in

1454
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:12,020
the hypothesis that you're considering but it will sort of if it's that's not the

1455
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:15,970
case still do at least as well as passive learning to some constants and so

1456
01:29:15,970 --> 01:29:21,100
forth and so that's one way you can make things agnostic just kind of hybrid

1457
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:24,180
of passive and active learning

1458
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,300
OK so let me i've talked about

1459
01:29:28,430 --> 01:29:31,700
the classification problem we just say that again let me give you a sense of

1460
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:35,440
some of the other settings where we can use active research question

1461
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,730
this is one

1462
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:59,420
well so so so so the question is how exactly do you divide the sample

1463
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:02,920
budget let me and let me kind of try to answer the questions

1464
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,400
number two

1465
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:08,330
as a user talk

1466
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,500
take the raw

1467
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,750
injected into a mouse

1468
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:18,880
what happens

1469
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,880
let's about

1470
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:24,820
because these are invariant

1471
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:29,750
it's just do some simple controls

1472
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:33,130
let's take this move bacteria

1473
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:35,800
auto claims

1474
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:38,440
keep them up to very high temperature to kill them

1475
01:30:38,450 --> 01:30:41,230
how do we know they're dead

1476
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:46,340
the great triplet mapping growing more that there there that so take he killed and

1477
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:53,390
you can verify in the lab that they're killed he killed smooth

1478
01:30:53,490 --> 01:31:00,370
checked that that they really were killed inject them into the mouse and what happens

1479
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:04,440
the because i mean the bacteria i

1480
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,190
last of all

1481
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:11,090
we take the utterly harmless rock

1482
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:15,140
the utterly harmless

1483
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:18,580
he killed smooth bacteria

1484
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:23,370
we inject them into the mouse

1485
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:25,420
what happens

1486
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:26,860
it dies

1487
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:34,250
that is result

1488
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:37,610
because the rough bacterial life killed this mouth

1489
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:40,110
this the bacteria that have been he killed

1490
01:31:40,150 --> 01:31:41,710
well not kill this mouse

1491
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,040
but together

1492
01:31:43,050 --> 01:31:45,580
they killed mass

1493
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:49,640
this is very puzzled

1494
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:51,460
what was even more puzzling

1495
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:54,320
it was when you autopsy the mouse

1496
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,880
you can isolate from the mouse

1497
01:31:56,940 --> 01:32:00,110
smooth virulent live

1498
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:05,860
but you didn't put any

1499
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,380
very strange

1500
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:12,570
so this actually yields

1501
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:17,130
smooth sailin bacteria

1502
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:20,250
despite not having put me in there

1503
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:23,860
during on bacteria somehow

1504
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:26,190
we were able to create

1505
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:30,390
smooth and very one bacteria not notwithstanding

1506
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,950
now having put any in

1507
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:34,440
so of course

1508
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:37,110
then attempted to say

1509
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:39,270
well what was it

1510
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:44,050
that allow this to happen so you could try putting in dandruff bacteria with dead

1511
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:47,940
smooth bacteria that doesn't do anything he does something alive together

1512
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:52,320
live rough bacteria you could then say let me take that the dead

1513
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:56,550
virulent bacteria and storefront shading it biochemical e

1514
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:58,840
and asking what fraction

1515
01:32:58,850 --> 01:33:03,900
all of that material from the dead bacteria allows us to

1516
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:07,360
to have this property of being able to now

1517
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:13,560
produce real bacteria to kill mites and just how utterly tedious and painful experiment is

1518
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:15,560
you take the dead bacteria

1519
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:20,050
you fractionated into lots of different biochemical fractions for each fraction had to test whether

1520
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:21,170
has the property

1521
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:24,340
that should have about of mice

1522
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:29,670
this is a very tedious procedure i mean it's it is it's you know you

1523
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:33,800
can understand how important the as a is how how important it is to come

1524
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:38,220
up with easy ways to do things in order to be able to accelerate progress

1525
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:44,060
griffiths tried hard and roughly began to purify fractions and get information about what the

1526
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:48,190
fractions were but in fact this work really never did lead to a clear conclusion

1527
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:54,560
that to tell people that there was some material which got named the transforming principle

1528
01:33:54,590 --> 01:34:01,770
this is almost like an old alchemical kind of word a principle being a and

1529
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:03,950
and a particular chemical

1530
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:09,820
composition of matter what you don't know tissue called a principal living principles to make

1531
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:12,910
up so what was the transforming principle

1532
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,400
well it really took

1533
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:23,400
work about fifteen years later by a mccarty in mccloud

1534
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:27,060
to sort this out

1535
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:29,210
when every mccarty mccloud

1536
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:32,870
it was the same experiment basically

1537
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:35,980
except minus the mice

1538
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:38,440
what they found was

1539
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:41,490
you could take

1540
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:44,670
dead bacteria

1541
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:51,520
combining the dead very on back the dead smooth bacteria

1542
01:34:51,530 --> 01:34:53,940
combine it with the

1543
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:56,690
live ralf bacteria

1544
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:04,390
by combining it in the right way in the test tube

1545
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:08,320
you would be able to play it out on the patch reply and sees smooth

1546
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:11,580
understanding the data are placed in this

1547
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:16,380
the sensation of the ontology

1548
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:20,890
OK i'm actually here we can make use of the link is not on that

1549
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:24,370
applications are not industrial not that the solution but

1550
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:27,220
thing solutions OK

1551
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:31,580
and in general we know a lot of things already even in the con to

1552
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,680
so few that because of the first thing that we know is that the pig

1553
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,270
alley we can not

1554
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:38,740
i assumed to be able to

1555
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:39,980
the main

1556
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:43,250
o in relation to the two sounds

1557
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:47,240
and let me the some concept last year

1558
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:52,700
this is considered obsolete due to poor it's considered to be very nice

1559
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:54,390
and actually

1560
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:59,250
what little shown is that we need to rely essentially on queen is that we

1561
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:01,840
make and the sources so we can not

1562
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:07,460
mathematically content there's also concept in the global view but we have to

1563
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:11,020
queen over the sources two things in the long run

1564
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:16,410
OK in that you

1565
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:19,600
in provides us with a

1566
01:36:19,610 --> 01:36:22,960
by these kinds of mappings OK by this kind of mappings

1567
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:30,600
mapping where we have a query over the sources that these maps

1568
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:33,660
two one element of the ontology

1569
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:38,870
this is the most kind most used kind of mapping in that integration

1570
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:45,460
then there are also other things for example we map one relation in the source

1571
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:50,670
to a query over the ontology became very nice and elegant mathematical tool

1572
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:54,500
OK however in practice is of no use

1573
01:36:55,490 --> 01:37:00,120
as we see here in a moment of the data that no one you have

1574
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,150
been the sources are either

1575
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:07,040
OK so these are operational databases these are not clean things OK to clean things

1576
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:07,790
up here

1577
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:08,740
not here

1578
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:09,760
it's so

1579
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:12,890
this is the kind of idealised work

1580
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:17,350
and in fact what you can do maybe it's to make the two of them

1581
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:19,870
in a being a query over the sources

1582
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:25,370
in marked with three over ontology is the most sophisticated kind of mapping has been

1583
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:28,900
one important thing

1584
01:37:28,970 --> 01:37:35,020
we are dealing with incomplete information OK even in in standard thinking of that i

1585
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:40,040
integration we are dealing with incomplete information and this is good news for us because

1586
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:47,790
for incomplete information they are being to deal with incomplete information are particularly

1587
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:50,550
a good in doing this

1588
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:54,640
on the other hand this means that the way we do pretty answering of system

1589
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:59,120
to make this we have to compute the answer key is going just say

1590
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:01,920
actually computing connection

1591
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:04,390
as we have seen can be very costly

1592
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:09,290
OK computer set that all the ontology can be very costly

1593
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:15,620
and so that's why we are going to use like a like a the language

1594
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:21,140
for the ontology OK so so as to reduce the cost of its OK so

1595
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,880
to make it happen feasible

1596
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:28,520
so the solution that we all we are proposing here in the following we think

1597
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:35,490
the sources we've them and presented as relational sources insist on the technology

1598
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:38,990
we take all these multiple sources

1599
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,120
OK we use if it is shown

1600
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:46,650
to see them the single relational database OK

1601
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:49,770
this is also standard technology and what we do

1602
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:54,700
we make use of the allied to describe the domain in the ontology over here

1603
01:38:55,400 --> 01:39:00,090
and in this way we are able to exploit effectiveness of query answering for if

1604
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:02,530
you live in particular we exploit the

1605
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:07,150
the complexity low complexity but also we exploit the fact that we can do the

1606
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:09,660
right thing in not only shape

1607
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:11,990
relational queries OK

1608
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:14,100
SQL queries to

1609
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:16,250
these that federation tool

1610
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:19,960
so this is the basic idea

1611
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:22,720
we don't

1612
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:26,970
not doing something missing steel

1613
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:31,020
and the point is that even if this is now a

1614
01:39:31,030 --> 01:39:36,440
can be seen as a single database is still extant in independent from the ontology

1615
01:39:36,530 --> 01:39:42,260
OK it's all we need to really look at them up so how are we

1616
01:39:42,280 --> 01:39:47,490
the data from the sources and see them as instances in the ontology this is

1617
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:49,370
the critical problem OK

1618
01:39:49,370 --> 01:39:52,710
properties of this optimisation problem

1619
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:58,790
it was the first case it easy point p of five zero

1620
01:39:58,890 --> 01:40:01,120
if on the other hand

1621
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:06,670
it's the point which satisfies this inequality

1622
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:09,430
the if i can be non-zero

1623
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:13,340
so the point appears in the expansion of the solution

1624
01:40:13,370 --> 01:40:17,300
and in this case the point is called support vectors

1625
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:20,820
so just to be completely clear the support vectors

1626
01:40:20,830 --> 01:40:23,410
the points that

1627
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:25,860
lie exactly on this line

1628
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:31,170
where this quantity here takes the modulus one

1629
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:32,430
and those who

1630
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:35,370
you can have non zero five

1631
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:39,920
they don't have to but usually they do

1632
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:42,250
and i would support the

1633
01:40:42,330 --> 01:40:44,600
and and

1634
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:49,030
the nice thing about having this expansion of the solution is that you can then

1635
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:53,660
plug in this thing here into our form of the decision function so remember the

1636
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:56,370
decision function is similar to

1637
01:40:56,390 --> 01:41:02,470
well actually the decision function simply say

1638
01:41:02,510 --> 01:41:07,720
i have to take this function here wx plus b and check whether positive or

1639
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:11,660
negative so i decided i want to say plus one this i want to see

1640
01:41:11,660 --> 01:41:14,930
minus one so i take the sign of this

1641
01:41:14,980 --> 01:41:16,460
function here

1642
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,600
and then

1643
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,180
i plug in my

1644
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:23,980
the support vector expansion assigned of this function like in w

1645
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:29,110
gives me this equation here again i'm using the fact that the products are linear

1646
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:32,020
and the nice thing about this is that

1647
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:35,410
now with reduced it to the dot product between

1648
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:38,100
training and test points

1649
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:39,960
so this is something

1650
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:43,120
now we can do in the feature space if we want to win we have

1651
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:45,390
methods for computing this

1652
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:50,120
not only based on the input points but also based on points living in

1653
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,730
dimensional feature space

1654
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:55,110
so this is the solution

1655
01:41:57,430 --> 01:41:59,970
i'm actually going to skip this one

1656
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:04,430
and i continue and substitute

1657
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:06,180
these two equations

1658
01:42:06,210 --> 01:42:10,960
they got by taking the derivatives with respect to the primal variables

1659
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:14,260
these equations into the like one function

1660
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:17,520
and i can eliminate the primal variables

1661
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:20,430
and after a little bit of algebra

1662
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:24,510
and that's again i would recommend this as a little exercise

1663
01:42:24,530 --> 01:42:25,430
not now

1664
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,270
but maybe

1665
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,430
in the break of time

1666
01:42:29,710 --> 01:42:33,080
six maybe ten minutes it's

1667
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:38,410
straightforward it's just a little bit to be if you're not used to doing

1668
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:42,300
such calculations you have to think about it but the

1669
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:46,550
it is straightforward calculation so you substitute these things

1670
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:52,320
and then you will find that the result depends on the i five so remember

1671
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,850
is said we have to

1672
01:42:54,030 --> 01:42:58,470
minimize with respect to primal variables maximize with respect to do there was no we

1673
01:42:58,570 --> 01:43:00,380
eliminate the primal variables

1674
01:43:00,390 --> 01:43:03,320
so all that's left is the function of the dual variables that we have to

1675
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:05,980
maximize with respect to these two variables

1676
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:10,670
and it's so nice function here it's a quadratic programming

1677
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:15,700
by which i mean something that depends on

1678
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:18,820
five quadratically linearly

1679
01:43:18,830 --> 01:43:22,730
so here we have the quadratic parts

1680
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:26,150
and again the nice thing is this quadratic part

1681
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:28,640
the only thing that depends on the data points

1682
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:32,690
and it only depends on the data points through dot product

1683
01:43:32,690 --> 01:43:34,290
again this is something

1684
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:38,920
we can do in terms of functions

1685
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:42,820
now we have both the decision function

1686
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:46,820
the function that we actually to maximize in order to find the coefficients of the

1687
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:48,050
decision function

1688
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:52,650
expressed in dot products so we can use the kernel we can use everything that

1689
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:54,830
we've learned yesterday

1690
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:58,170
OK now we are just so beta to go to zero

1691
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:04,370
so we just let beta be set equal to one of a number of

1692
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:06,190
and just like in again

1693
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:08,350
OK what you see here is essentially

1694
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:14,700
except these terms here so what you see here is essentially out roles optimisation objective

1695
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:19,840
when you minimize the subjective essentially minimizing this barrier function

1696
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:21,910
and at the same time peter

1697
01:44:21,930 --> 01:44:26,760
also decreases because these these first go to infinity

1698
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:33,830
so this is the connection between minimizing the exponential and solving the linear programme

1699
01:44:33,870 --> 01:44:35,870
so essentially adaboost role

1700
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:43,370
barrier optimisation technique in order to solve the linear programme

1701
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:44,840
other questions for that

1702
01:44:44,850 --> 01:44:47,180
this is the last slide protection

1703
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:56,820
everything q

1704
01:44:56,870 --> 01:45:07,170
OK so then for the next part

1705
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:12,080
so this part is about extensions and applications

1706
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:16,750
more talk more about the application the the extension is not so much about applications

1707
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:22,070
and of course there's also the relation of posting with support vector machines i mean

1708
01:45:22,070 --> 01:45:28,100
you've seen posting somehow maximizes the margin and support vector machines also maximize margins might

1709
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:32,570
ask what is really the exact relationship

1710
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,210
good so let me remind you

1711
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:42,340
support vector machines solve this optimisation problem so there's a bit simplified i removed the

1712
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:44,910
bias and are able to soft margin OK

1713
01:45:45,050 --> 01:45:50,450
so it right they try to find w so not norm of the hyperplane that

1714
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:54,920
classifies essentially all points correctly with a margin of at least one

1715
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:57,550
i mean with the distance of at least one

1716
01:45:57,590 --> 01:46:02,890
so we can reformulate this optimisation problems maybe somehow

1717
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:05,130
replace this one with role

1718
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:09,800
OK and then picks the one norm and two norm of w to one

1719
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:13,800
OK so he simply say OK so we don't want to minimize the number of

1720
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:17,890
w thinks the norm of w but on the other hand the big then we

1721
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:24,020
cannot have one here we have to have very here and then we maximize this

1722
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:31,180
very so this is actually equivalent if i think music equivalent if role is greater

1723
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,730
equal greater than zero

1724
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:37,310
and this is the equivalent

1725
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:41,360
OK let's say this is in d dimensional space

1726
01:46:41,370 --> 01:46:45,680
and i'm using the style j of x and here is this is just adjacent

1727
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:49,140
to mention so i just want to write this

1728
01:46:52,810 --> 01:46:58,390
so in boosting the try to find this a linear combination of hypotheses OK

1729
01:46:58,630 --> 01:47:05,090
and essentially boasting adaboost on TV and so on the basis of this optimisation problem

1730
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:10,740
so it looks very very similar so also maximize margin here we also have this

1731
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:11,950
form here

1732
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:16,630
it's just instead of the pi j we just have hj

1733
01:47:17,230 --> 01:47:20,550
and the other is marked here so and here we have not the two norm

1734
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:23,970
equal to one we just have the one on equal to one

1735
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:31,950
and the dimensionality of the space is equal to the number of hypotheses

1736
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:34,100
OK so

1737
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:40,020
boosting the the user pages space which is generated by the hypothesis space and support

1738
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:45,460
vector machines we just use a feature space which is generated by by the kernel

1739
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:49,690
very similar everything is everything is a

1740
01:47:51,150 --> 01:47:53,620
but even more explicit so

1741
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:59,060
essentially for any hypothesis that we can generate the feature mapping pi

1742
01:47:59,110 --> 01:48:04,150
just the this definition what we can even generator can also given the hypothesis space

1743
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:08,690
we could generate suggested by taking the sky park and that the feature space

1744
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:11,190
can explicitly defined it

1745
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:15,410
OK i guess that should be pretty clear

1746
01:48:15,610 --> 01:48:19,110
and also like from from the kernel we could in principle if if you know

1747
01:48:19,110 --> 01:48:21,140
if you would know the feature map phi

1748
01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:25,250
then you could extract the the future i mean the the base process it

1749
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:28,560
just projecting one-dimensional

1750
01:48:30,190 --> 01:48:33,990
so in support vector machines we have the two norm

1751
01:48:34,130 --> 01:48:35,930
so that's the euclidean distance

1752
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:39,990
so we try to maximize the distance of the points to the hyperplane with the

1753
01:48:39,990 --> 01:48:41,230
two norm

1754
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:46,630
in support in boosting the use it if we constrain the one that is equivalent

1755
01:48:46,630 --> 01:48:53,110
to maximizing the l infinity distances so and so when use the one norm here

1756
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:58,410
plus the q norm suckitude i'm sorry that's for the

1757
01:48:58,410 --> 01:49:03,990
constrained so let's say you're constraining with the q norm you maximizing the

1758
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:07,170
p not became the PAQ was really like this

1759
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:15,250
so we'll see table three we have the infinity norm that infinity distance is maximized

1760
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:20,540
given that

1761
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:27,350
so you've also seen the bounds which have been derived for support vector machines boosting

1762
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:33,000
also they look very much similar so this is the risk of the so empirical

1763
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:37,500
all this expected risk of the function that empirical risk and then we have this

1764
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:41,170
bound here also in terms of

1765
01:49:41,190 --> 01:49:42,520
OK that's margin

1766
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:47,370
and boosting we have the empirical margin risk and then we have very similar formulation

1767
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,540
so in both cases is independent of the them

1768
01:49:50,540 --> 01:49:53,600
dimensionality of the space

1769
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:55,640
OK one more important thing

1770
01:49:55,650 --> 01:49:59,580
so what's called the machines seen the represented here

1771
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:03,190
so that tells you that the optimal w

1772
01:50:03,230 --> 01:50:07,830
the optimal way vector to live in the span of of all the examples

1773
01:50:07,830 --> 01:50:10,180
and then the corresponding

1774
01:50:10,210 --> 01:50:14,300
operation is going to be just multiplication of of these two matrices right this is

1775
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:18,870
what's going to happen if you first let x one xn you in the next

1776
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:20,370
two years

1777
01:50:21,170 --> 01:50:22,860
this is of course

1778
01:50:22,870 --> 01:50:27,690
this compound operation is of course

1779
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:30,880
the group element x two times x y

1780
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:34,810
and that has the corresponding matrix growth two

1781
01:50:34,830 --> 01:50:36,580
x y

1782
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:45,440
so the fundamental thing that these matrices are going to have to

1783
01:50:45,490 --> 01:50:49,940
o baby by virtue of being associated with the group is

1784
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:57,110
this multiplicative property that grew x ten times for x one because really

1785
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:00,560
x two x one

1786
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:03,700
one way to look at it is that the matrices really kind of model the

1787
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:09,690
and so you have a group which is the abstract mathematical objects it has the

1788
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:13,560
multiplication law

1789
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:15,610
one way to make it more

1790
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:21,850
concrete is to associate with each group element the simplest type of mathematical object you

1791
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:22,980
can think of

1792
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,040
that can capture non commutativity

1793
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:32,070
and the that type of object matrices so this is just way of bringing groups

1794
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:36,800
down to to each group element i associate matrix that behaves the same way as

1795
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:41,790
the group elements to this is exactly what the representation is

1796
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:49,090
the representation is a mapping from the group two

1797
01:51:49,110 --> 01:51:52,570
the set of the by the complex matrices

1798
01:51:52,590 --> 01:51:56,340
obeying this fundamental multiplicative

1799
01:51:57,490 --> 01:51:59,680
so for example if you do this for the

1800
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,620
quaternion group

1801
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:04,150
you get out the famous dirac matrices

1802
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:10,680
which dirac introduced in the late nineteen twenties to model the states of spin one-half

1803
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:12,800
particles such as electrons

1804
01:52:18,050 --> 01:52:23,650
again a mathematician sees structure and the question you asked is what are the kind

1805
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:28,510
of fundamental types of structured so here i told you that each group can have

1806
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:36,190
you can think of many possible representations what are the really fundamental types of representations

1807
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:43,720
one thing that you notice pretty fast

1808
01:52:43,740 --> 01:52:47,040
is that if you take any representations zero two

1809
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:53,310
and the conjugated by matrix and that's cheap way of getting a new representation for

1810
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:56,190
so if i give you one representation

1811
01:52:57,130 --> 01:53:01,970
then you can get this whole sequence of representations i just by conjugation by matrices

1812
01:53:02,010 --> 01:53:06,470
and that sort of doesn't count since direct representations which are related by such as

1813
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:09,490
similarity transformations are called equivalent

1814
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:15,610
another way to get more complicated representations from simpler ones it's just take the that

1815
01:53:15,610 --> 01:53:16,970
direct sum

1816
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:23,140
so this is what is happening here two representations are one and two and

1817
01:53:23,150 --> 01:53:26,950
and putting them in this block diagonal form but i get out obviously obeys the

1818
01:53:26,950 --> 01:53:28,930
same multiplicative relations so

1819
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:37,340
o itself representation even if i can't if i conjugated by matrix t

1820
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:43,020
in this case through is called irreducible representation is clearly not fundamentally that it breaks

1821
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:46,690
apart into some of these smaller representations

1822
01:53:46,830 --> 01:53:53,400
what's going to be important to us are complete sets of an equivalent irreducible representations

1823
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:59,110
so there is some amount of freedom in choosing this usually because

1824
01:53:59,140 --> 01:54:06,460
you know you you defining these irreducible representations modulo this equivalence relationship so each equivalence

1825
01:54:06,460 --> 01:54:12,000
class you can choose which representative you want which representation you want to

1826
01:54:12,670 --> 01:54:13,900
you want to take

1827
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:18,410
but mathematicians spend a lot of time describing

1828
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:24,170
complete system the african continent irreducible representations for particular groups is itself often the major

1829
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:28,510
task and we see that the that it's important to

1830
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:32,830
to solve this task because because there

1831
01:54:35,140 --> 01:54:41,770
many things that we're going to do in the future depend on taking individual elements

1832
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:43,640
from such set

1833
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:49,370
i'm not going to

1834
01:54:49,390 --> 01:54:55,660
are not going to to explain why this is the case but it often proves

1835
01:54:55,670 --> 01:54:58,750
to be convenient to use unitary representations

1836
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:00,900
where the inverse

1837
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:08,890
so the representation matrix corresponding to the inverse of an element is just the

1838
01:55:09,390 --> 01:55:14,920
the commission conjugate of the matrix corresponding to the element itself

1839
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:21,600
so in the following i will also will always assume that are particular set of

1840
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:26,420
interconnected we saw representations consists of such unitary representations

1841
01:55:29,850 --> 01:55:36,440
the fundamental theorem very early on in representation theory representation theory is that you can

1842
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:37,810
do this sort of

1843
01:55:37,870 --> 01:55:40,890
reduction into irreducible was four

1844
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:42,390
any representation

1845
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:46,980
and the reduction is going to be unique of course up to the ordering of

1846
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:52,100
the of individual terms in the decomposition

1847
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:57,210
so if i give you a general representation of a group then

1848
01:55:57,230 --> 01:56:00,480
you can reduce it into some

1849
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:04,890
from your favourite set of an equivalent irreducible representations

1850
01:56:05,170 --> 01:56:07,770
and you can essentially only do it one way

1851
01:56:09,730 --> 01:56:15,920
asking how representation introduces into some other disabilities a well-defined questions

1852
01:56:15,980 --> 01:56:20,710
the final trick that we need from representation theory has to do with taking direct

1853
01:56:20,710 --> 01:56:26,060
product of representations so that's another way in which you can get more complicated representations

1854
01:56:26,060 --> 01:56:30,500
from simpler ones and it's easy to see that if you take two representations and

1855
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:35,440
just take the kronecker product of direct product and then what you get is

1856
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:39,040
also representation but usually it's not

1857
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:44,690
so you ask how does that reduce into a sum of irreducible

1858
01:56:44,710 --> 01:56:47,620
well there is some sequence of irreducible is that

1859
01:56:47,660 --> 01:56:50,830
you get out and also

1860
01:56:50,850 --> 01:56:55,100
some matrices here which affect the right transformation

1861
01:56:55,370 --> 01:56:59,500
so this is called the collapse gordon series and these matrices clapped recorded

1862
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:04,230
matrices and this is the famous problem in representation theory kind of right at the

1863
01:57:04,230 --> 01:57:08,230
beginning when you start exploring the representations of a given group

1864
01:57:08,350 --> 01:57:11,580
which is often surprisingly hard

1865
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:18,460
the physicists will be familiar with the club's one coefficients of rotation groups and
