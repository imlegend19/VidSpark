1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
the people actually call which is like the ratio of true positive over the true

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,050
positive class

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,660
false negative

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,760
this is similar to partially an for the specific class

5
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,990
and of course the precision how many times yes

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,770
but out of everything that to predict how many times he made

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,220
a correct prediction this DP

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,770
over the people SFB

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,550
in order to get the good

10
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,840
trade between these two values people use f

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,190
in the measure

12
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,940
most typical ways to

13
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,230
use this formal here however the more general formula

14
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,260
is using the factor better

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,270
and in this case if you could if you have better equal to one get

16
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,550
this formula however if you want to and this is equal

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,260
the between recall and precision if one to put more weight into recall all precision

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,210
can change this parameter

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,430
also your so familiar that

20
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:01,550
people also use terms and metrics like that actually the falls alarm right

21
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,900
so it actually is defined in the same way as

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:10,280
recall it it is basically how many times i predicted something correctly

23
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,490
false alarm rate is basically trying to say how many times i see i'm saying

24
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,410
that something is and always but it's not is actually the normal

25
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,020
and as the trade between these two

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,330
values people usually construct our sicker and seek review

27
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,060
on the x axis using false alarm rate

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,480
y axis using it actually an ideal our seeker should be something like that for

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,430
the false alarm you can to achieve one hundred percent it actually

30
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,440
but this is usually positive in your life as you can imagine in most real-life

31
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,460
our secrets look something like this

32
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,220
so these are the typical

33
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,620
four hours

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,160
and of course the

35
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,700
people also trying to measure the area

36
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,210
under the curve as

37
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,680
as a metric to evaluate different it classification thing so anomaly detection techniques

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,850
in recent years people were also trying to

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,020
improve the measure of area under the curve by proposing

40
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,750
to compute how big our the class first making

41
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,620
so basically instead of

42
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:22,160
providing the measure for the test data that you're dealing with these basically giving go

43
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,380
impression how good generalizability the model has so i think there are

44
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,620
april and produce here proposing different

45
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:35,870
variations of area under the curve

46
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,570
OK and i mentioned earlier there are different applications of anomaly detection prevention network intrusion

47
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,400
detection their applications of different fraud detection like credit card fraud insurance fraud

48
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,660
in health care informatics and medical

49
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,970
the agnostics

50
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,480
we also have the problem of one likely to industrial them infection may have different

51
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,070
engineering systems that may experience some false

52
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,940
in image processing inredis will anomalies are extremely important to the text of some events

53
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,510
like the life back into the report something suspicious

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,860
and finally there is a topic of

55
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:21,980
a lot of affection text line

56
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,370
so in intrusion detection as i said

57
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,790
you're trying to monitor

58
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,200
the computer network

59
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,690
in order or computer system in order to

60
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:43,490
and the natural for certain intrusions intrusions usually defined as attempts to bypass the security

61
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,100
of computer or of the network and

62
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,610
the typical challenges in metric intrusion detection world

63
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,560
some of them did most of

64
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,590
industry they actually the current state of the art and character in the state of

65
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,310
the art

66
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,450
introduction to the most of people who think signature based intrusion detection systems

67
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:07,150
most of you have either divides can more than that is taken for the viruses

68
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,230
you you know that

69
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,630
you often have to go to the actually it's done automatically by the software is

70
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,070
going to the web site trying to download all the information so the viruses

71
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,420
and then it uses this definition is to

72
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,490
to to detect all devices and computers

73
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,260
so it means that is really important to have the behavior of each nucleon some

74
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:34,180
average everything so that's why microscopic approaches are not able to reproduce

75
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,410
these effects which

76
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:41,300
are trying to send only six nicholas difference which are very important

77
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,220
because you have really changed

78
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,100
in the limit scheme

79
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,220
just often

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,890
if you look at the angular velocity of a rotating nucleus you can calculate

81
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,800
these rotational angular velocity is

82
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,510
then to the forum nineteen wrong per second

83
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,510
i had a very powerful washing machine and it's only one one thousand three hundred

84
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,930
round per minute so it's really really

85
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,680
very high angular velocity

86
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,410
so that's why it's so you need a very strong interaction that with jack all

87
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,660
the part

88
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,700
i will conclude with the summary of this talk today

89
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:36,410
so i first introduce a macroscopic description of the nucleus in terms of illiquid

90
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,370
presented the fact that you have these data by taking a formula with different terms

91
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,640
it's able to describe the gross feature of the nicky i

92
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,280
but for many many properties you need really introduce

93
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:01,140
microscopic description so you need to consider the nucleons and the interaction

94
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,360
there are different

95
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,470
two kinds the shell model

96
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,340
where you have

97
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,570
and in car and particle which are p

98
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,860
but you take into account all the the exhibition from this particles limited and you

99
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,600
have the countryside which is the mean free

100
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,860
you have all these particles

101
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,370
but they do interact with the mean field so you have the restriction of the

102
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,620
interaction that take into account

103
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,530
conclusion many nuclei are found deformed in their ground states

104
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,720
and then this i really think that the information

105
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,990
this something that is obtained through express with very

106
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,140
but it's something that is really

107
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,620
important to do

108
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,030
to explain experimental results because the spectroscopy

109
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,260
strongly depends on the deformation

110
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,680
thank you very much

111
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:08,620
so this

112
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,260
when john for

113
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:50,100
if you have a question also how making modifications the greatest

114
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,570
you don't get

115
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:03,780
the other

116
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:12,200
there was a question at the beginning of my lecture that i told fellow to

117
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,660
ask at twelve o'clock

118
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,470
but then he sees somehow disappeared but i think it would actually be worth discussing

119
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,300
surface OK can i can i have a go that

120
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,430
generate some

121
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,660
OK so sometimes the feedback can become catastrophically lower

122
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,740
and painful

123
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,570
but let me just proceed the recall yesterday that there was the question

124
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,890
of an example of the use of bayes theorem

125
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:41,140
and i think that my answer that i get yesterday was not completely appropriate because

126
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,200
i gave effectively frequent

127
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,050
the example of the use of bayes theorem

128
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,180
so this was that this was the

129
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,550
i said that suppose i have two types of events signal and background and signal

130
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,860
events i have the distribution of some variable x that's like that

131
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,300
and for background events i have some distribution like that and i use bayes theorem

132
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,320
to derive

133
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:08,120
the probability that the event was a signal event given a measured value of x

134
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,280
is that bayesian user bayes theorem more or frequentist base there

135
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,550
the idea is is the following is that each event

136
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:24,220
being signal or background is itself a characteristic which changes randomly when i look at

137
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,200
different events so the hypothesis is that events the signal event because the event background

138
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,300
events is itself the outcome of a repeatable

139
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,740
procedure so this really is the frequencies used

140
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,010
of bayes theorem

141
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,140
for single given event i can also ask the question what is my degree of

142
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,990
that this one event is the signal a signal event and then that would be

143
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,510
equivalent that would be the same formula that would be a bayesian user base there

144
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:55,140
but i think the question what to do with the following suppose my hypothesis is

145
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,030
the value of the parameter some parameter theta

146
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,180
and this is a parameter whose value i don't know and i want to try

147
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,860
to estimate its value by making some measurements and suppose i have

148
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,120
probability function

149
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,090
which tells me what the probability to get to a certain measurement outcome x is

150
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,300
given the values data

151
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,840
and what i would like to do is i would like to get the posterior

152
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,120
probability for

153
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,370
given x and i use based

154
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:31,050
so tell that is equal to the probability for x given data

155
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,490
times the prior probability for data

156
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,220
and then this would have to be normalized

157
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,840
in some way

158
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,240
normalized so that the area under the

159
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:48,390
resulting probability distribution is a unit so now the question is

160
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:54,620
k of x y x is just like computing the inner product between phi FXI

161
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,100
and five x

162
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,750
so this is why it's it's very simple the kernel trick is a very simple

163
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,080
it it's

164
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:11,770
of obvious obviously restaurants very strong mathematical tools but it's if you just want to

165
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,600
use it if you want to construct your own

166
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,620
kernel method which is a little late because there are a lot of things that

167
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,160
have been done in this area but still you can try to to find a

168
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,770
new kernel kernel

169
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,420
i don't

170
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,520
whatever you want

171
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,710
the idea is that you just have to find the product first you have to

172
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,850
express everything in terms of dot product

173
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,040
once you're done with that then you know that you can do

174
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,160
you don't you can cook kernalized everything

175
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:52,520
and the optimal classifier now is just expressed as a sum of for i k

176
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,960
of x i x

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,790
plus b

178
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:05,420
so i'm going back to the very simple classifier talked about at the very beginning

179
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,140
remember that we have the

180
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:13,190
right point we have the blue point i think i take the heat

181
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,290
the mean of the red points mean of the blue points i draw a line

182
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,120
that passes through the middle of those two points and i say that all the

183
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,830
that fall on one side of plus

184
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,460
o point our positive point and the others are negative points

185
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,040
what we had before is that we knew that

186
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,980
instead of these we have the

187
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,580
classical inner product

188
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,670
and now i don't change anything

189
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,830
except that i did my my my little trick with the kernel trick

190
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,980
i replace the inner product that used to appear here by

191
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,940
k of x i x

192
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:57,250
and the value of alpha i is unchanged is still the same value as before

193
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,190
and the values of b easily be changed because if you remember

194
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,440
b is expressed as

195
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,440
the difference of the square norm of c-minus and c plus

196
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,100
and if you you you do the computation

197
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:16,170
you see that actually the versions of the square north sea minus is

198
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,460
so if you want to see

199
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,560
how it works

200
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,640
you have

201
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,620
c-minus that is equal to

202
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:39,040
that is the definition of minus

203
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,270
if you take the norm

204
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,140
the squared norm of this

205
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:55,250
you just

206
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:02,330
and so using the linearity and everything that you know about the inner product so

207
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,480
and here you happy

208
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,080
because you have not products

209
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,890
and you say OK instead of that

210
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,210
i'll use

211
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,310
and that's it

212
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:43,020
so this is how i get these these are like that

213
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,920
so now i didn't i didn't specify any any particular are kernel

214
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,250
and i'm going to

215
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,600
to show you

216
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:01,690
classical kernels that are usually there are used are that are well known and

217
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,960
that are used when you work with the vectors

218
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,060
first he got some kernel

219
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:14,540
usually when you try to do a kernel you when you first meet with kernel

220
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,640
methods and you want to try your first kernel algorithm what you're going to use

221
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,020
it for the gaussian kernel

222
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,940
because because it works

223
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,100
it's apparent arrest kernel because you have these is sigma here

224
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,560
that be

225
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,000
parameterized properly but usually

226
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,790
you can manage to to find good value and are you happy with your first

227
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,100
kernel kernel methods

228
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,270
the corresponding and he then implicit h

229
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,670
of infinite dimension

230
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:00,310
again i'll come back and this a little bit later on actually at the end

231
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:08,120
of the talk when i talk about more theoretical things and more theoretically grounded things

232
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,900
the polynomial kernel

233
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,730
it is very simple

234
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,640
it's just the usual dot product between u and v plus constant and to the

235
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,100
power of the

236
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,250
so you can see that the usual inner product

237
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,730
which she which correspond to the situation where c is equal to zero and is

238
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,020
equal to one

239
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,940
so the usual inner product is just the kernel as well

240
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,560
another kernel that has been used with support vector machines even though it's not

241
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,120
it's not necessarily a mercer kernel that is

242
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:49,620
you cannot say what kind of the mapping is a society with which is exist

243
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,870
is goes with with this kernel is the punch

244
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:01,230
so either it's not the tangent kernel which is the hyperbolic hyperbolic attended tendered rules

245
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,580
so it is that you can

246
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,210
i don't know i've never worked with it but i know that people have

247
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,620
what i want to do what we want to show you here is is how

248
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,290
can for for some examples of kernel

249
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,600
kernels how you can identify

250
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,980
the mapping that goes with the kernel

251
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,960
but you choose for instance

252
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,440
you take the polynomial kernel k defined here

253
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,900
so this is just the square of the inner product is not very very it's

254
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,190
not very elaborate cytochrome so you take the square

255
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:53,730
and this corresponds to the situation where c is equal to zero and is equal

256
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,250
to two

257
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,120
in the previous definition

258
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:05,080
and you can you can identify mapping that works there is a mapping such that

259
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,250
when you take the kernel between u and v then you have that k of

260
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,040
u and v is equal to phi of to the dot product between phi of

261
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,620
u and five v

262
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,890
so the the function phi

263
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,350
the mapping phi that's why i proposed to to look at is

264
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,350
this one you take x that is made of two coordinates its of x one

265
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,460
and x two and you build

266
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,620
three dimensional vector

267
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,120
that is

268
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,850
x one square

269
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:47,350
visualizations of what's happening in the in the LDA situation

270
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,810
right so OK so

271
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:57,130
we have place the dirichlet prior on mixing proportions in each group and we want

272
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,380
to take k to infinity as we have seen every where we take it in

273
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,960
infinity each document now is going to be

274
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,650
the infinite limit is going to produce a dirichlet process mixture model

275
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,420
and let's see what happens

276
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,520
so we have the dirichlet process mixture model in document one and then we have

277
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:23,210
another dirichlet process mixture model for the document to and because the documents

278
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,710
and because the python basically drawn i i d from this

279
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,980
from this dirichlet distribution we're going to have two independent draws

280
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,130
the same dirichlet process but there are still two independent ross

281
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,120
so in

282
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,580
document one we're going to have to set of atoms is given by the dirichlet

283
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,880
process and i'm going to go to the set of atoms

284
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,850
and what's the problem here the problem is that

285
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:57,600
if the base distribution is small so in this case the base distribution is itself

286
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,600
a dirichlet distribution

287
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,130
and it is a small distribution over probability simplex then this set of atoms

288
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,460
i will never overlap with this set of atoms

289
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,730
and i recall that the location of the atoms are the topics in

290
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:21,790
in our corpus so the set of topics that is used to describe document one

291
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,460
we not overlap with the set of documents with a set of topics that is

292
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,000
used to describe document two

293
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,130
and so

294
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,790
there's no sharing of topics across documents so that's

295
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:37,000
where this thing fails it's it's not sharing topics across the different organs which is

296
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,500
what we really want

297
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,730
just think

298
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,170
so this is the sort of so what's the solution to this the solution is

299
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:53,440
actually very straightforward the problem is that our base distribution given by this red line

300
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,940
in this most distribution is one where if you opt in

301
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,980
multiple draws from an is roster

302
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:10,150
so gaussians if you can draw lots of different samples because it and

303
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:14,560
every time you get a different number opt similarly here

304
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,150
and this so

305
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,920
the problem is the issues small so we're going to make it not small just

306
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,710
making discrete distribution

307
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,940
and in the discrete distribution we will

308
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,710
be forced to reuse

309
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,210
the topics basically so we we can make the base distribution discrete and that will

310
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,710
solve this problem of no sharing of clusters

311
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,420
and what the what distribution over

312
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,290
discrete distributions can we use

313
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,010
dirichlet process based on the first thing that comes to

314
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:56,800
right right so we can place a dirichlet prior on the key common base distribution

315
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,980
of this to dirichlet processes

316
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,980
OK so that's what we're going to do

317
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,860
we can do the following so

318
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,510
we're going to have a g zero which is drawn from a dirichlet process

319
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,800
and g one and g two

320
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,500
going to be i i d draws from the same dirichlet process

321
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,620
but the base distribution

322
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,960
now it's going to be g not

323
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,940
this is going to be are discrete distribution

324
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:25,390
so this can solve some problems in this thing is called hierarchical dirichlet process for

325
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:29,180
the obvious reason we have a dirichlet process on top of

326
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,000
the dirichlet process is a hierarchy

327
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,930
so let's visualize what's happening so is going to be drawn from a dirichlet process

328
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,380
so it's going to be an infinite sum of

329
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,620
of of atoms

330
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,460
so this is given by the blue

331
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,800
text here

332
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,220
and then both g one and g two

333
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,880
the locations of the

334
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:58,670
of the atoms in both of them are going to be drawn from g not

335
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,360
so in particular each of the stakes in g one will be one of the

336
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,290
six the location will be by the high could could differ

337
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:13,170
and the location of the sticks is basically corresponds to a topic so the topics

338
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,760
in document one will be shared with the topics in document

339
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,390
the new rules

340
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,860
far for the whole corpus

341
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,770
yes so you can think of

342
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:38,120
zero as this as first drawing the self topics that describes the whole corpus

343
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,860
and for every document

344
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,590
it will used exactly the same set of topics but you will have a different

345
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,020
probability of picking each topic

346
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:54,130
the red line is the base distribution the at the top

347
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,720
that thing here

348
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,040
OK so

349
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,650
so this thing has

350
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:07,040
been applied to document topic modeling

351
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,020
perhaps a shift

352
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:15,860
shawn little result here so what's quite nicely so you know you now do you

353
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,150
have to choose the number of topics so you can vary the number of topics

354
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:24,790
from one two hundred or something and you can see u-shaped curve where on the

355
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,020
left we have

356
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,520
high and low probability on the right we have no property and in the middle

357
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,430
we have high probability

358
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,540
this is

359
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,760
and the fitting of one overfitting on the other side there's a regime where

360
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,050
the number of topics is just about right

361
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,750
and the HDP basically was able to find

362
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,140
the number of topics

363
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,260
we can also apply this to infinite hidden markov models

364
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:58,000
welcome to the next slide so

365
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:02,080
so here is basically the infinite hidden markov models so we have a hidden markov

366
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,250
model here

367
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:07,460
OK so this our observations x one two x tau

368
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,500
and these are hidden states

369
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:14,620
change together as a markov chains that one goes to that too goes to the

370
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,560
tree and so on

371
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:22,670
and in the typical hidden markov model this that's only a finite number of states

372
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:26,180
in the model so we have the ten states

373
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:31,150
so we need to describe the the transition probability from each of the ten states

374
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:35,150
to each of the ten states so it's is matrix ten by ten matrix

375
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,300
whether rule some to one

376
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,980
and met

377
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,000
of you are not can

378
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,730
familiar with computer vision

379
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,410
to school

380
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,030
very few about five

381
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,380
for those of you who are familiar with

382
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,770
computer vision

383
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,490
how many of you are not familiar with

384
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:07,400
three d reconstruction motion or epipolar constraints for those things

385
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,280
about half

386
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,770
so this is what this problem is to imagine that i take a video sequence

387
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:21,660
and i walk around and take immediate and i'm looking at the world athletics imagine

388
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,030
that this could be in the

389
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:29,000
this is what i assume i assume they don't have a GPS or any other

390
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,040
sensor my camera so i have no idea where to those pictures

391
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:36,560
now i just give you all the pictures and i tell you

392
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,370
can you please

393
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,860
tell me what the position of the camera was twenty two those pictures

394
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,300
and can you please tell me

395
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,020
or make a three d model

396
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,680
from these two

397
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,430
the pictures

398
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:56,700
and this is of course useful for building models of those things but it's also

399
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,500
very useful in robotics for instance you can put a camera on helicopter

400
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,470
they could fly

401
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,570
and the helicopter can be the map of the terrain around and

402
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,390
so that he can navigate and avoid running into things we can put into a

403
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,840
so the question is how do you do this

404
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,380
and the traditional way of doing this is that you

405
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,340
take your pictures and you extract set of points or corners or point of relevance

406
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,660
for instance in the building typically you be corners in the wind

407
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,350
but this is done automatically is not that you manually click

408
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,030
although many experiments we do that for showing the performance there is that somehow you

409
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,480
can get corners in the first image and somehow you can get corners and the

410
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,530
second in image

411
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,030
and by looking at how these points move as a function of time

412
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:50,430
you can figure out what the camera positions where as well as building activity

413
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,670
of this

414
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,460
so this is what called motion the camera positions and structure is essentially what are

415
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,930
the coordinates of the points in three d space

416
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:04,480
is that more or less clear

417
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,560
the next level is well this is this is nice and this has been a

418
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,270
research problem in computer vision for the last thirty years but

419
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,160
this only applies to buildings

420
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,840
so have now look at a parking lot and there are many cars are moving

421
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,320
one applied because he

422
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,870
one part of the EU's moving one way and another part of it is another

423
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,410
way what if i want to apply to people

424
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,530
then there will be many motions or want to apply to images of water it

425
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:41,070
will work at all because the water is not known words that in sense

426
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:46,150
so the next problem and this is something that's been very popular over the past

427
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,610
few years is well

428
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:55,180
how do i ft multiple motion models to different parts of the image maybe here

429
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,880
the trees is moving faster than the background in media could segments

430
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,990
the tree or in this case you have a car

431
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,870
and the camera is also moving in what i need to do is

432
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,600
two reconstructions of the same time one the car one background but the but

433
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,670
i know how to construct with the camera was located but also what is the

434
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:21,020
position of the cart relative to the camera because now i have two motions at

435
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,720
the same time but

436
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,740
is challenging because i don't know which pixels move according to which

437
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,490
motion model event that then it will be

438
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,300
the standard problem so this is the same thing as fighting two lines if you

439
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,660
the models are a lot more complicated i have to feed

440
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:44,830
rotations translations calibrations and there's project predictive so there's a lot of riemannian geometry and

441
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,880
projective geometry involves just to solve the problem for one group

442
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,470
but now i have also the segmentation but so is the combination of

443
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,190
differential geometry

444
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,290
for the

445
00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:01,740
motion itself and algebraic geometry for the segmentation on own

446
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,720
so this is the problem

447
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:10,340
given a video sequence determine how many motion models should defeat

448
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,130
what are the

449
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,880
parameters of emotional

450
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,420
so if you convert

451
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,430
you want to convert from finite to centigrade or the other way around

452
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,990
in foreign

453
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,590
nine fifty

454
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,590
time and temperature in celsius

455
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:36,280
plus thirty two

456
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:39,400
if you take long temperature

457
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,710
twenty degrees centigrade

458
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,370
i was grown up with

459
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,140
europe everyone uses centigrade there

460
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,380
then you can see that

461
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,070
in terms of finite

462
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,070
that comes

463
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,000
sixty eight degrees one point

464
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,690
nine fifty times twenty

465
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:03,250
thirty six and thirty two

466
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,900
minus forty degrees centigrade

467
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,260
it's the same

468
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,990
minus forty degree fine

469
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,200
check that

470
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,060
twenty two scales cross-over

471
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:20,900
almost the entire world uses set celsius scale it's part of the metric system

472
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,250
united states is one of the very very few countries

473
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,980
we're still in the robbers one way

474
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,520
uses degrees fahrenheit this is really a pain in the neck by these for me

475
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,900
i have very little feeling for it i just happen to know that room temperature

476
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,700
sixty eight because that's the way i set my

477
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,880
was that my home that's about all

478
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,130
i can think in terms of degrees fine

479
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,110
there is no limit to

480
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,380
high temperature but there is a limit to

481
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,760
low temperatures is an absolute

482
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,390
this absolute zero below in which you cannot go is about minus two hundred seventy

483
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,530
and if you take a system that cannot transfer energy

484
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,630
to any other system that is in thermal contact with

485
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,580
then it is at that lo was possible

486
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,000
this is the way we define it

487
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,200
about minus

488
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,880
four hundred and sixty degrees find

489
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,630
so we now have a third scale which was introduced by lord kelvin

490
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,630
british scientists

491
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,400
a lot of research on heat

492
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,500
and he introduced the absolute scale whereby uses the

493
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,270
the lowest possible temperature

494
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,610
as zero degree

495
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,770
but the increments in terms of

496
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:43,310
increase of one degree uses the same as the celsius scale

497
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,580
so an increase of two or three degrees kelvin is the same as an increase

498
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,650
of two or three degrees centigrade

499
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,400
so if we now compare the three scale

500
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,500
and calvin

501
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,970
then twenty degrees centigrade will be

502
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,800
sixty eight finite

503
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,710
and that would be

504
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,130
two seventy three point fifteen

505
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:10,720
plus twenty let's round often make two ninety three

506
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,720
and if we take

507
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,810
then we would have minus two hundred and seventy three point one five let's leave

508
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,730
that offer now

509
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,750
and its proximity minus four hundred six

510
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,310
we almost always work was degrees kelvin

511
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,600
in physics

512
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:33,600
and we'll discuss that in more detail friday

513
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,340
most substances

514
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,710
x band

515
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,470
when you heat them

516
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,970
and if we start with an object

517
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,630
which has length l

518
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,620
and i need

519
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,610
about thirty degrees

520
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,160
it gets longer

521
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,720
by the amount of

522
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,660
and delta l

523
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:01,610
can be expressed in a very simple way

524
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,590
it is all five

525
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,650
times l

526
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,770
time delta t

527
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,840
of size called the linear

528
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,200
expansion coefficients

529
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,130
and the units i

530
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,480
one of degrees centigrade

531
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,920
one of the degree kelvin is the same

532
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:29,270
because it's it's increments matter

533
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,140
very values for all five

534
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,310
different great deal

535
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,330
give you some values for of

536
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,910
if copper

537
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,380
the grass

538
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,520
if you buy rex

539
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,470
if in four

540
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,110
and i'll give you few and their own unique

541
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,380
ten to the minus six

542
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,000
o degrees centigrade

543
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,220
we will use some of them today

544
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,660
price is about nineteen

545
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,910
operators seventeen

546
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,310
three point three in four

547
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,660
o point nine and steel is roughly twelve there are many different kinds of steel

548
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,240
in four

549
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,620
it was a great invention notice it has a very low expansion coefficient is very

550
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,700
in the nineteenth century even today

551
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,100
to make instruments

552
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,930
very precise like clocks

553
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,420
clocks affected by

554
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,550
the expansion of the gears

555
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,920
so the invention of in far which is a

556
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,040
of sixty four percent

557
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,950
ireland thirty six percent nickel was invented by

558
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,550
physicist dr

559
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,480
in eighteen ninety eight for this discovery he received the nobel prize

560
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,950
in nineteen twenty

561
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,380
this something how important it was

562
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,380
get it

563
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,280
l or that has a very

564
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,410
low expansion coefficients

565
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,520
if we use these numbers

566
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:02,510
let's look at the expansion of for instance a railroad

567
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,150
whitaker railroad

568
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,590
and we take this stretch of rail

569
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,650
which is a thousand metres

570
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:14,830
we take the view i this is the expansion coefficients

571
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,340
and we compare called a small extremely cold recall there was a hot summer day

572
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,790
a cold winter day minus fifteen degrees centigrade

573
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,790
and a hot summer day left thirty five degrees centigrade

574
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,030
so delta t

575
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,630
would be about fifty degrees

576
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,790
so what is the alpha l

577
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,850
well that would be

578
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,840
twelve times ten to the minus six

579
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:47,960
times ten to the third

580
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,220
i'm fifty

581
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,080
there i i made an attempt to define something which was a little bit misguided

582
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,950
so instead of defining efficiency the way you've got it right there are going to

583
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,010
what what's

584
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:04,800
called something different for refrigerator which is called the coefficient of performance

585
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,790
so it's the following

586
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,090
we can define the

587
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,760
the coefficient of

588
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,460
written as a

589
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,000
here too

590
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:00,550
in other words we you know it's it's how much heat

591
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,430
can we

592
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,330
pull out of the cold reservoir

593
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:10,260
for whatever amount of work that we're gonna put in order to do that

594
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,510
of course would like that to be as big as possible

595
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,240
but of course this is just

596
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,670
q two

597
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,810
over minus

598
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,190
q one

599
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,620
plus q two

600
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,660
but just to be clear

601
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:39,040
the work in

602
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,500
so let me just rewrite that is i just want divide by q one everywhere

603
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,150
so i mean right this is huge two

604
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,360
q one

605
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,590
one class

606
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,020
q two

607
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,080
or q one

608
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,390
i want to do that because we know that q two or q one is

609
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,850
negative t two or t one so this is negative he two

610
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,610
thirty one

611
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,540
one minus the two

612
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,690
over t one i can

613
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:21,850
can solve those and multiply through by

614
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,470
t one

615
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,490
so this is just going to be t two

616
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,290
over t one

617
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,090
minus two

618
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,950
coefficient of performance

619
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,100
OK so it's a measure of how

620
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,550
well we can do

621
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,310
to run the refrigerator so

622
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:55,530
you know what the second law is doing in words it's putting these restrictions on

623
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,650
how well or how effectively we can convert

624
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,510
you heat into work in the case of the engine or work into

625
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,480
the heat extracted in the case of refrigerator

626
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,680
and it

627
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,240
it follows qualitatively

628
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,720
from just

629
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,810
your ordinary observations about the direction in which things go spontaneously right you know that

630
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:21,100
he isn't going to fall from the whole body to a hotter body without putting

631
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,440
some work into make that happen

632
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,150
and so

633
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,450
will be able to follow that further

634
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,340
and c

635
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:32,900
really how to determine the direction of spontaneity

636
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,460
for me

637
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:38,680
a whole set of processes really in principle for any process

638
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:41,360
when analyzed properly

639
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,960
OK so the first step to doing that is i want to just generalise our

640
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,690
result so far for kano cycle

641
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:54,380
you might think well OK but this is a pretty specialized case right we formulated

642
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:58,040
one particular kind of engine

643
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,690
and see how we can

644
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,410
analyse what it does

645
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,190
come up with relations

646
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,980
same value for efficiency and other quantities

647
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,220
how general is it

648
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,190
well let's take a look

649
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:20,510
what i wanna do

650
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,990
is make

651
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,440
a new engine

652
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,080
which really just consists of two engines

653
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,640
side by side

654
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,400
one is our carlo engine as we've seen

655
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,630
and the other is just some

656
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,060
any other

657
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,450
reversible engine

658
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,900
generalise or

659
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,280
engine results

660
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,930
the car park reservoir and

661
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,400
drive bigger we know it has to be be anyway since

662
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:05,600
we can extract heat from without changing the temperature

663
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,280
and on this side

664
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,660
we're gonna

665
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,130
right out of

666
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,740
an engine and we're going to say this is a common knowledge

667
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,540
on the side of it

668
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,650
we have

669
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,790
q one prime

670
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,870
we're going to have w prime

671
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,270
we're going to have a few

672
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:32,190
draw the arrows in the positive direction and

673
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,460
in these cases

674
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,330
or in the define directions i should say

675
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:43,370
are colder

676
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:48,200
OK so so here is just an engine that like what we've already seen and

677
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,540
i'm going to

678
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,630
specify that this is the car no

679
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,520
engine which is to say all the results that we just derived hold for this

680
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,990
and side by side

681
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,730
we're going to run another engine

682
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,340
so it's got

683
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,400
q two

684
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,360
it's got cycle

685
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,790
and it's gone

686
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,000
q one

687
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:21,270
so this is some other

688
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,140
it runs using reversible

689
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:37,460
i can define the efficiency of each one of them right efficiency for the

690
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,060
one on the left is

691
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,810
minus w over

692
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:44,680
q one efficiency prime for the one on the right is

693
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,230
nine w prime

694
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,100
over q one prime

695
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:55,890
now i want just assume

696
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:00,810
that in some way they're different so let's assume

697
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,350
epsilon prime

698
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,790
is greater than epsilon

699
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:14,770
so in other words like this efficient this this engine is running less efficiently than

700
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,000
kano engine

701
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,080
it's also reversible and

702
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:24,560
now since it's reversible we can run it forward backward

703
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,480
we could run this one backward

704
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:36,500
and we can use the work

705
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:41,190
i told you about the use of next new superconducting linac for these techniques in

706
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,020
crisis that

707
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,480
using accelerators for protontherapy carbon ions

708
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,370
the b-side to the single most probable

709
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,170
and i think of laws

710
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:58,150
for carbon ions in the light of the latest developments of the superconducting inside and

711
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,790
i tell you about

712
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:06,210
the thing which is the next fast cycling accelerator for carbon ions say

713
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:12,410
this is a need of the future accelerator in my mind a future accelerator growth

714
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:17,060
for creating moving organs you see this you have to what you have to force

715
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,370
open you don't suppose somebody has the tumor in the lung

716
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:23,670
one by the human pose

717
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:28,600
and and you don't want to be those allowed to board the needed to cover

718
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,140
the two because this means that the healthy tissues so you want to follow the

719
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:40,940
tumour and ways of knowing whether two ways nowadays many different techniques nobody knows which

720
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,940
is the best but then we may know where the tumor his but then when

721
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,290
you send the beam of protons carbon ions

722
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:54,960
you would like the one the walls these places and if it comes

723
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:59,520
in site why women who want to increase the energy to pass through even to

724
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,170
get the important to you understand that with the technology developed for LSE impairment of

725
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:10,080
control computers and so on this in principle is feasible because this is not the

726
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,460
target is not going the whole thing is that human beings so must be more

727
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:19,850
careful now according to see but still is faces but then you must have machine

728
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:24,140
which does that and you see the solution which has been tested by

729
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:30,330
a our colleagues in downstate is change energy by moving

730
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:34,640
and that's all because the end is the beginning of this accident is fixed

731
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,140
he moved this acts so

732
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:42,190
and then you the energy develops and luckily is easy with magnus can with these

733
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:48,080
and if you use this compensation you can give a good move in in front

734
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,580
of like this the symbols that you will

735
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,620
static this is an improvement on the front

736
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,210
but of course we want to implement and of course my point i point to

737
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:02,690
point to go into this new kind of accelerators which not exist is but the

738
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:06,350
solution if you could then the energy

739
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:12,420
but at to do with a millisecond instead and moving organs electronic if you machine

740
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,980
which is not fixed energy for a long time as a single cycles and but

741
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,920
you can and this is the idea

742
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:25,650
behind what we call a particular entail cyclinac cyclotron class in iraq

743
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:30,920
for image guided hadrontherapy see those decided or single cycle

744
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,620
you know what it is with a computer controlled source

745
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,080
which has been which comes out

746
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,270
charles short

747
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:45,000
the two five mike nichols' second lengths two hundred hertz for instance which gets into

748
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,270
many models

749
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:50,580
which are powered by generators and you get to be

750
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,710
in fact the being is

751
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:59,100
very short in electoral in but and you know it is very short few microseconds

752
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:03,560
and it additional weight is typically hand two hundred or so you get times a

753
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,850
second about

754
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,890
and now imagine that you can vary the power in this model is

755
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:11,830
and you can get any

756
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,520
energy you want

757
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:18,330
i changed a few milliseconds the same times it takes to move laterally and we

758
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:23,620
also want to do so you get this way of making it the conformal treatment

759
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,730
of moving objects in the city and it behind all this development and the development

760
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:33,790
of the data of past that if age is this i would have been working

761
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:35,520
on this for thirteen years

762
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,020
and this is what comes out only image

763
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:44,040
we call it either institute for the annual stick-in-the-mud therapy which is a cyclinac foucault

764
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,390
of the sources a cyclotron

765
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,060
of thirty

766
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:52,690
the most useful the pharmacy is the site of a major new at the beginning

767
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:56,080
you can do it by night a lot to modify this baby

768
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:00,500
use it to accelerated and you have here the energy available

769
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:06,540
so me and to understand and you can buy very fast and this is something

770
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:12,070
that building the first being built in this month's period we've made a prototype it

771
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:17,230
works building the first unit and this is built by company which is called the

772
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:21,560
publication of the text is made is in this spin-off company

773
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:24,120
which would be light

774
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:28,890
and there's an agreement with IBA to deliver both this and again because the game

775
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:33,370
is equal to the ones practically equal to the ones used by you by other

776
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,250
questions so this is the first bus cycle

777
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:39,580
called machine then we designed for

778
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,170
a fast cycling machine based

779
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,040
on a superconducting cyclotron designed by

780
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,210
colleagues in

781
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,520
and idea

782
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,540
which is called sent

783
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,980
which is used

784
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,520
accelerating courtney carbon ions

785
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:03,150
two and energy such that one i do not last seventeen centimeters so

786
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,940
this is the use of sand filters

787
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,940
for the second one has the patience yet but then it is only three hundred

788
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,940
million people look at these three thousand six hundred people

789
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,870
so you can go more than seventy centimeters and no

790
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:18,910
you can now

791
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,540
this is unique

792
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:26,410
strictly come bottom and you can get to city centre for carbon ions and having

793
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,810
again this possibility of varying the energy fast

794
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:35,220
this idea of combining this cycles with the line that gives you the possibility of

795
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:40,460
very fast fast cycling both portals and carbon ions

796
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,060
there is solution

797
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:47,120
which is still in design this big proposals for carbon ions is very difficult to

798
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,370
conceive a new type of machine

799
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,830
i think about three types of machine

800
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:56,810
at the beginning but was slide every know every speaker speaks from you here is

801
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:01,940
like because it's the only part the tools otherwise you do that in forty five

802
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:06,460
minutes and they not have so it is not true there is another type there

803
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,880
i hope this is quick

804
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,390
what are the

805
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:17,160
the some new settings in semi supervised learning one thing i think it is going

806
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,740
to be interesting is this online customizable west learning center

807
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,820
so imagine

808
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:30,460
here's robot to mars rover sent to mars and a it's taking pictures it's taking

809
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:36,530
with so high african frame rate that not all pictures can be sent back to

810
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,740
hours to get labeled for

811
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,560
from scientists so let's say this is the first picture is sense back and people

812
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,150
sense factories people say OK this is not an interesting picture so let's say it's

813
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,520
trying to classify images interesting that

814
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:59,030
so if you have this example which is a label which is zero

815
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:03,510
and the second image maybe you didn't get the chance to send inspectors so there's

816
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,510
no labels

817
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:06,750
and so on and so forth

818
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:11,260
then at some point it takes a picture and people

819
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,080
back at our so says OK this is interesting

820
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:18,670
so you have a positive example and so on so many

821
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,760
images will be unlabelled

822
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,300
and furthermore

823
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,670
there's another twist

824
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:28,030
after taking many pictures of these kind of object people

825
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:32,110
back hours my say OK those are no longer interesting right so the same kind

826
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,900
of facts might not change its labels

827
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,090
so what we have we have a learning problem on the reverse side to try

828
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,150
to decide whether an image is interesting or not

829
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:47,130
the number of examples throws

830
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:52,800
there might not be they also arrive sequentially

831
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:56,440
and you may not be able to store them all so cannot hold them more

832
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,030
most examples will be unlabelled

833
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:05,760
if you will be labeled so therefore its semi supervised learning but in this online

834
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,400
criminals setting

835
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,880
there's maybe there's no even no idea assumptions such that

836
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:19,300
the joint line joint distribution can change over time

837
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:28,590
so here's exactly the setting at

838
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,860
time step t

839
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,570
there's some

840
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:33,190
two story picks

841
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,590
o point

842
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:37,990
xt and on the line label

843
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:40,730
but this is not necessarily i i d

844
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,280
so it's going to show xt to the learner

845
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,070
the learner has the classifier to maintain so

846
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,400
at time t it's f t

847
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,690
it will predict ftxt

848
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:56,550
then we use a small probability

849
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:59,260
the world is going to tell the learner what

850
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,010
the true label white he is otherwise it will not

851
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:04,650
however so the

852
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,970
i remains on labels

853
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:11,610
and then finally the learner has to update

854
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:15,090
it's classifier fifty two fifty plus one

855
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,940
now with x

856
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,740
he or and potentially widely if not scale

857
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,630
but we also wanted to update the classifiers even if what is not given

858
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:29,840
and this repeats forever

859
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:38,420
as one example of this setting let's look at one particular

860
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:45,800
semisupervised learning algorithm which is manifold regularisation we've seen before

861
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,630
so let's recall what

862
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:52,550
the objective for the for that is so here you have

863
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:55,030
the this is labelled

864
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:57,420
the last term so delta function

865
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,530
this basically says is quite he labelled or not

866
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:04,210
big t is the total number of input but only a small fraction of that

867
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,670
we have delta y equals one

868
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:08,550
and those data points

869
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:13,460
you want to measure the loss of your prediction and the true labels

870
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,530
and you have this long term

871
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:20,050
then you have this across energy term which is

872
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,820
pairwise between a

873
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:25,690
now this is what we call the patch

874
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:28,320
loss function because it assumes you have

875
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:32,920
all big key example was their one and only vote in front

876
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:39,570
what we want to do is to say that we can not do that because

877
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,260
we don't have all the data in front of us

878
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:49,940
instead we can use something else which looks similar but it's an instantaneous loss

879
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,630
this loss has the subscript t

880
00:55:54,260 --> 00:56:00,210
and if you look at that you know this could coefficient is really just

881
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:03,590
the term at time small t

882
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,110
and you have the same norm

883
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,110
and here

884
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:08,280
instead of

885
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,990
complete graph term where you have all pairwise

886
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,110
here you have

887
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:24,670
xt to all previous ones but nothing else

888
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:31,730
now there's an interesting property that this

889
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:37,840
that risk is the same as the average of those instantaneous risk

890
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,780
the way we define it

891
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,050
and what that gives you is the way to do

892
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,570
learning comics learning

893
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:53,130
in a very simple manner but still have some theoretical guarantee

894
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,590
in particular

895
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:55,900
we're going to

896
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,730
instead of

897
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,340
solving the

898
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,650
minimizing the

899
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,110
bach objective

900
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,090
we're going to

901
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:09,460
try to minimize the instantaneous

902
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:10,860
loss function

903
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,260
at every step but just by a little bit we're going to do gradient step

904
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:20,840
to try to minimize this instantaneous risk

905
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,240
so that's what we will do well

906
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,570
the former gradient descent

907
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:31,510
and the step size we perform this gradient descent has to be cared to certain

908
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,880
there's one thing that we need to

909
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,150
remember that the accuracy is not defined in this case

910
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:43,380
because we don't have IID samples

911
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:49,380
the accuracy can be arbitrarily bad close to one if the world keeps changing the

912
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:53,360
correct mapping so that's not the correct quantity to look at

913
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:57,760
the correct quantity to look at is instead how well

914
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,280
your ass

915
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:04,490
performs small as he at each time step

916
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:07,400
performs on those instantaneous risk

917
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,880
when you add them average them together

918
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,590
and you want to compare this

919
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,010
we is

920
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,530
the batch

921
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:16,650
loss if you

922
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:20,690
i had the luxury of all data points and select the best one to minimize

923
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,050
if you want to look at the difference

924
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,420
and here's the argument

925
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,610
if the world keeps changing the underlying concept

926
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:34,880
f star here the batch loss will be bad because there's no single

927
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,190
function that can

928
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:41,810
so one day i was this early this intermediate degrees it would like to combine

929
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:45,240
so we have two come

930
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:50,980
so i also talked about generalizing comes and he talked about what the kernel learning

931
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:54,400
so we try to find a linear combination of

932
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:58,430
so we have the combination coefficients here one

933
00:58:58,450 --> 00:58:59,470
what you can

934
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,080
and then i would like to find the optimal combination of fish and you can

935
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:08,550
do this by solving slightly more complex optimization problems which is called a semidefinite programming

936
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:13,350
for second order cone programming and they can find the coefficients

937
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:14,730
alpha coefficients

938
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:19,690
what's more pictures and the coefficients what kind of the same time

939
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:23,860
so it's a globally optimal solution

940
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:26,220
this is one way of right

941
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,990
another way was to

942
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:34,860
extent have joint feature maps so you not only have come along the x

943
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:38,040
the input but we cannot on the outputs

944
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:39,960
so we include the labels

945
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:42,490
in the future

946
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:45,970
the phi functions

947
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:52,250
and there different ways of using this points the conditional interviews or type of about

948
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,490
maximum margin

949
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,400
structured output learning

950
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,830
here the idea is that the

951
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,910
try to learn a function

952
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,840
f of y given x

953
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,560
which scores segmentation why

954
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:08,960
well given x

955
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:17,490
and in this function we can predict label just by maximizing the function of all

956
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:18,850
possible y

957
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:24,540
OK so you have some all possible labellings and just take pretty with the labeling

958
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,830
which has the maximum score

959
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:31,730
one of the training what can we do so we can

960
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:35,310
so we end sequences sequence here

961
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:37,770
in particular of the

962
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,640
and now we would like to f

963
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,600
such that

964
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,480
score for the true labeling

965
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:48,170
it's much larger than the score of the problem

966
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:52,950
so on compute difference you have this kind of optimization problem would like to find

967
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:54,410
the function f

968
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:59,330
such that this difference here this is the score the the true labeling minus the

969
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,810
on april labeling

970
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,000
is large so greater than one

971
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,500
in a few cases the allowed to be smaller than one

972
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,460
but but this expect

973
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:12,160
and we have one constraints from leaving

974
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:16,260
because they can be exponentially many different probably

975
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:21,040
i mean for instance when you consider segmentations of sequences so there might be really

976
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,790
i mean different many different possibilities of place

977
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,860
OK so

978
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:30,580
other questions with

979
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:34,700
i'm going to use this in the applications later but again

980
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,310
so how can we solve these kind of problems so would like to solve this

981
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:45,240
so now i used actually so you

982
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,710
he was still had the function f you

983
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:51,920
now i'm using the kernel function the joint feature map between

984
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:56,800
between x and y and the trying to come up with a linear function here

985
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:00,460
and we try to maximize the margin between the true in the wrong

986
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,190
the idea is that

987
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:06,600
solve the optimisation problem what small set up from labeling

988
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:11,680
it may be just one from leaving the beginning we solve the optimisation problem

989
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,150
this the number of constraints still small

990
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,560
using this solution

991
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:22,640
you can find other constraints other labeling which

992
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:24,630
don't satisfy this constraint

993
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:27,860
b at what will come

994
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,050
we iterate this

995
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,490
the constraints are not satisfied

996
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:36,580
the size of given node the siblings of g would be a and b are

997
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:41,200
a and b all siblings meaning of the same generation of the same for the

998
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:46,800
same yes father the notion of so this one is an ancestor of of this

999
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,800
one and this was a descendant of this once you've got all this sort of

1000
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:54,720
the cavalry there's one curious vocabulary on which people don't agree on which is do

1001
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,260
we should we use for the sun all almost daughter

1002
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:02,240
OK so i mean have seen both and there's a strong movement so we do

1003
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:07,640
not want to use father-son mother-daughter would be better

1004
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,700
i will not enter into debate

1005
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:17,720
there are more definitions and there are cases where people are interested in having particular

1006
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,470
binary trees

1007
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:23,600
some which are going to be said to be for four means we don't like

1008
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:28,930
dangling branches where there is only one of the two siblings so that means that

1009
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,050
we will have either zero or two children

1010
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:34,430
that's when you're going to say the tree is full

1011
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:35,970
and perfect

1012
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:42,160
or complete usually after complete here where i disagree with with mister wikipedia complete binary

1013
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,490
trees is when you fall and at the same time all the leaves are the

1014
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,120
same level

1015
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:54,140
OK see you've got a very nice trigger trees obviously not just interesting for us

1016
01:03:54,140 --> 01:04:02,120
i mean there are essential for people working with with data structures because that's not

1017
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:09,870
still is the best way to deal with variance in a complicated variance nowadays too

1018
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:18,010
stop the data and be able to access is as fast as possible

1019
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:23,530
OK some things about algorithms trying to return to what we've already said all strings

1020
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:26,850
you can edit you can use an edit distance

1021
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:31,620
OK which you can compute the variance people are not quite agreeing on what should

1022
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:34,300
be the right edit distance

1023
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:39,550
you do have tree kernels which i said that people have from problems agreeing on

1024
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:44,160
what an edit distances one tree can it's also say it is not at all

1025
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:49,140
as easy not at all a simple to be able to to do tree kernels

1026
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,090
and get them to work

1027
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:57,640
you can of course to find patterns in trees and try work with these the

1028
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:01,320
general rule of the rule of thumb is that if you've got all the trees

1029
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,660
so so i mean the world really matters and the trees in the first few

1030
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:09,430
stargate for whatever you can do on strings you can do on trees

1031
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:11,140
his agenda

1032
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:16,180
there may be exceptions and basically i would work about as well the only thing

1033
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:19,370
is that you do find yourself with a lot more syntax

1034
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:25,390
in writing things in describing things because it suits it becomes necessarily much more

1035
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:27,590
and it's difficult because of that

1036
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,990
but i mean i know of

1037
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:34,830
four ordered trees no problem that would say polynomial in the case strings and certainly

1038
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:38,390
be exponential in the case of of trees

1039
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:46,100
yes about vocabulary when you've got a set of trees is usually called the forest

1040
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,660
and the sequence of trees is called a hedge

1041
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:53,300
there are a lot of variance i mean these are just some of the things

1042
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:58,180
i want to say about trees are just because yes well here with people who

1043
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:01,720
have worked well working a lot on trees and they don't have the chance of

1044
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:06,180
telling us about it during the bootcamp but there is a variant where the trees

1045
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:10,640
or or in order sort of then you can sort of makes around the different

1046
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:16,950
branches of the trees and becomes combinatorial clearly much more music

1047
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:19,430
and and difficult

1048
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:21,950
OK a quick word about graphs

1049
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:26,400
which are the next step up or we could say we've been two two five

1050
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:30,800
we've come back from that by saying the tree with some sort of attention to

1051
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,550
generate graphs

1052
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:36,950
and now what is the graph the graph can be

1053
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:42,490
something like this or something like this this would be an oriented digraph because it's

1054
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:50,530
got a little arrows little arcs and this would be normal graph without any orientation

1055
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:56,660
so an undirected graph which is the second object he saw is composed of vertices

1056
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,970
the singular is vertex and edge is

1057
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:04,070
they may be loops even if they usually of no loops in that case in

1058
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:10,260
the case of undirected graphs and the edges obviously or indirectly there's no beginning and

1059
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:15,050
no end so you would say that an edge is incident to two vertices to

1060
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:19,660
just say that it is touching at two ends on two vertices

1061
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,280
and of course it'll only be incident to one vertex

1062
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,490
if it is and

1063
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:34,160
this is the vocabulary to be some so digraph or die directed graph is

1064
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:38,470
this time composer composer vertices and

1065
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:43,940
sometimes you will also use the word edges to indicate their edges with arrows i

1066
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:48,600
prefer the word ox which is used places such as as edges

1067
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:52,470
now of course an arc is directed and and has now you don't see it

1068
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:56,890
start and that's why didn't put it in blue i was looking for the vocabulary

1069
01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:02,120
source and

1070
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,620
the station

1071
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:07,220
then to look at it

1072
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:15,570
six states would be or sink sink vertex is one where all the edges arrive

1073
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:20,990
and nobody's from the check that OK there is some vocabulary and it is worth

1074
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:25,620
looking into the vocabulary of the different things and using the correct recovery if not

1075
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:31,450
it becomes very messy the advantage of these theories with strings trees or graphs is

1076
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:35,660
in the vocabulary of using the correct when it does correspond to interaction if we

1077
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,470
don't have which is usually

1078
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:40,740
rough word right well then we getting there

1079
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:44,430
christians mixed up for example you get path in one case the change in the

1080
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:47,720
other cycle and usually circuit

1081
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:52,320
and connected is one case strongly connected not getting into this i'm just trying to

1082
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:56,070
point out the fact that there is a difference of recovery

1083
01:08:56,180 --> 01:09:02,470
OK why do we like grophs wider computer scientists like graph because they are great

1084
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:04,180
for modeling tasks

1085
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:09,220
OK when you get a problem and wrote problem from the outside world it is

1086
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:14,530
very efficient use these questions it is you will end up by drawing a graph

1087
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:19,890
to represent you will not end up by in most cases represented by string because

1088
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:25,660
the capacity of the string to model things is is not enough a truly is

1089
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:31,220
usually not enough a graph corresponds to first order logic so you're working on something

1090
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:36,700
which has a nice expressive power that is why people like coming up with graphs

1091
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:41,660
so from the modelling point of view graphs already great and it is reasonable to

1092
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:45,600
say well this is my you know i have modelled my problem as this set

1093
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,560
well you can apply the junction tree of

1094
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:55,230
this is the key observation

1095
01:09:56,620 --> 01:10:02,310
these are only be efficient for certain classes of graphs

1096
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:06,040
you can use it in q four five

1097
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:16,080
the only only be efficient for certain classes of graphs whose which was

1098
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:20,120
this is the class of what they call for about

1099
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:24,930
also called the only graph

1100
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:30,070
the junction tree algorithm actually runs scored

1101
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:33,620
also see what i call the is

1102
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:38,110
according to court first in order to understand what the core of the graph in

1103
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:39,630
the so what chord

1104
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,250
it is something related site

1105
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,290
four in the cycle

1106
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:49,750
is an edge

1107
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:53,080
connecting two nodes in the cycle

1108
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:56,270
but which does not belong

1109
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:00,100
you can see it as a shortcut decide for example if you see

1110
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:01,690
his cycle

1111
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:04,350
this cycle has no shortcut

1112
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:09,750
this cycle has more shortcut so it has no core

1113
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,850
these big cycle here

1114
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:14,500
has won shortcuts

1115
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:20,350
so these cycle has four

1116
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:23,980
now if you look at these graphs here so this graph is is not chordal

1117
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,420
because there are cycles

1118
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:29,810
but these

1119
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:34,350
the graph is chordal because any cycles of length greater than three

1120
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,020
as the shocker

1121
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:40,500
of course the cycle of length we can not have from each

1122
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:44,630
so basically you only apply for roughly with three

1123
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:47,040
for any cycle can think of here

1124
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,980
apart from the three psychologically three

1125
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,770
has a short

1126
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:53,130
the core

1127
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:55,730
so these graphical waterfall

1128
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,850
one the graph very very special types of graphs

1129
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:06,520
our technically speaking very nice things

1130
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:10,920
that's exactly what graph with a junction tree of

1131
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:14,710
before i said

1132
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,290
i said separately

1133
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:18,900
the junction tree of rules applied

1134
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,540
any type of graph

1135
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:26,630
that is no contradiction

1136
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:29,770
what if the graph is chordal

1137
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:34,100
you can add edges in the graph until it becomes chordal so if you have

1138
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,020
a graph

1139
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:41,580
which is like these

1140
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:45,100
it's not a part of that

1141
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:47,040
because has cycles

1142
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:50,350
with no shortcut

1143
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:52,880
instead of solving these problems

1144
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:59,250
in this graph i can solve the problem is

1145
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:00,810
because this graph was quite

1146
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:07,310
you know that i can apply the junction tree of the rules that

1147
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:12,850
then you can ask the question well you change the problem

1148
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:15,360
before you had this problem

1149
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:20,710
this problem which is different from

1150
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,190
he was

1151
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:23,330
a different approach

1152
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:28,150
it's much more general problems in the world

1153
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:34,900
more edges you you include the last conditional independence statements you are making

1154
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:41,250
so by including edges and making less assumptions about my probability distribution

1155
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:44,830
that's not the problem of losing information by doing

1156
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:50,500
that's the price to pay in order to be able to run the

1157
01:13:53,980 --> 01:14:00,250
exercise like this not important problem because of this issue that edges can all edges

1158
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:02,670
in the graph to make it work

1159
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:04,190
because in the worst case

1160
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,080
the fully connected graph

1161
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,500
he scored

1162
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:09,040
because any cycle

1163
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,400
greater than three

1164
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,440
has an edge has has a stroke

1165
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:19,120
so you can always add edges into making graph one

1166
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:25,980
you're just solving a larger problem

1167
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,860
so let's see the steps of the junction tree

1168
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:37,560
yes it's not

1169
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,880
this is an example of how it's not unique

1170
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,450
and this will lead to the restoration of learning and knowledge

1171
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:52,620
so followers of of bacon established the royal society in

1172
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:56,460
sixteen sixty two just after charles was restored

1173
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:59,630
to england after the period of problem well

1174
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:01,320
and there was a history

1175
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:03,280
written of the royal society

1176
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,880
a book about this thing

1177
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,300
published in sixteen sixty seven

1178
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:12,460
only five years after it was founded why did they publishing history so soon

1179
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:17,240
let's look at this that the brothers piece of this book here's the late francis

1180
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:21,280
bacon was said to be RTU minced or it

1181
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:24,510
restore the arts

1182
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:28,110
OK here's the president of the royal society the mathematician

1183
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:29,650
viscount broker

1184
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:33,900
and here in the middle being crowned with laurel is charles the second

1185
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,360
why do they have him up on a pedestal

1186
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:40,200
because they hoping to science scientists have

1187
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:42,010
before and ever since

1188
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:46,320
to extract some money out of the government to do their research

1189
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:50,540
they actually never got it from charles but wasn't for lack of trying and this

1190
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:53,130
is why they wrote the history

1191
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:56,910
to try to make the case for being supported

1192
01:15:56,940 --> 01:16:00,910
OK now let's look at all the good things that will come from science

1193
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:02,460
from the royal society

1194
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:07,280
in the background you see what that is will blow it up

1195
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:10,130
here there's a here to it on the bookshelf

1196
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:13,170
if you look really fine on the bookshelf you can see that some of them

1197
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:19,910
have title have written riding on the spine see with that one is

1198
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,150
anyway really

1199
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:30,840
what science book is a by the had

1200
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:35,500
so astronomy

1201
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,450
that's the telescope the back

1202
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:39,980
OK or over here on the wall

1203
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:45,690
but set that

1204
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:49,190
the clock was shaped like a piece of pie

1205
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:53,710
because it has the pendulum inside

1206
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,130
so or ontology making good clocks

1207
01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:59,330
OK or here

1208
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,450
what's happening

1209
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,470
it's hard for you know

1210
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,770
it's the wind gauge

1211
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:10,220
it has been inside the blows on this and you can tell from articles on

1212
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:15,050
the scale of strong wind is so meteorology

1213
01:17:15,070 --> 01:17:17,010
back here on the pillar

1214
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:23,960
but of those things for

1215
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,790
proprietorial thing

1216
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,770
now what do all these things have in common that they are going to do

1217
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,600
charles the second

1218
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,470
good clocks

1219
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:39,010
meteorology talk but

1220
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:40,590
they all have to do

1221
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,100
with navigation

1222
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:43,540
right with making

1223
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:46,740
england's strong and c

1224
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,400
now back here's another science

1225
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:56,240
that doesn't seem to have anything to do with navigation why would chemistry be important

1226
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:59,670
to charles

1227
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:02,700
to make gunpowder

1228
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:06,460
it was the chapter about gunpowder in the history of the royal society

1229
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:09,340
and appear at the top is the motto

1230
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:14,240
which is newly used in where bob which comes from this quote from morris

1231
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:18,070
and what it says is less you ask who leads me

1232
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:22,390
and what household by large that's what philosophy i advocate

1233
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:26,980
there is no master in whose words i am bound to take an oath

1234
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:29,600
wherever the storm forces me

1235
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,180
there are put in this the guest

1236
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:35,870
so it's the experiment not the philosopher that leads you

1237
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:37,420
to the conclusion

1238
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:43,280
so newly use and whereby is in the words of non

1239
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:47,840
and in fact the original name of the royal society was the royal society

1240
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:50,600
for the improvement of natural knowledge

1241
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:54,080
by experiments

1242
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:57,500
OK so we're going to see as the course goes along

1243
01:18:57,510 --> 01:19:01,610
important experiments that really decided questions and in fact

1244
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:08,080
bacon's most important kind of experiment was one that finally decides between two rival hypotheses

1245
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,520
proving the one

1246
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:14,260
and disproving the other say they do all sorts of experiments and just be

1247
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:16,760
collecting butterflies no

1248
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:21,180
i don't mean to insult people quite butterflies so finding the do

1249
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:27,410
there's something special about experiments that really are designed to answer questions

1250
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:32,740
now the bacon devised the name for such experiments and they are based on this

1251
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,790
you have a road diverges and you need to know which way to go between

1252
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:39,690
these two hypotheses

1253
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:41,880
what do you need

1254
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:43,860
you know which way to go

1255
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:45,730
you need to cite

1256
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:47,620
or this was across

1257
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:50,630
it would not be bound at the crossroads

1258
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:59,590
so the rock latin name for crosses crux you see what they call the experiment

1259
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,140
that's the origin of the word crucial

1260
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:07,400
it's the one that tells you which way to go

1261
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:08,940
OK so here is

1262
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,480
isaac newton

1263
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:13,600
and is holding something

1264
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:18,250
can you see what is holding in his hand

1265
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:22,690
you here

1266
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,620
it's the prison

1267
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:29,930
while still in prison because that was his crucial experiment

1268
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:33,860
and here's his diagram of that experiment with the prism

1269
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:38,800
he called it the experiment encourages taking the word from bacon

1270
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,380
OK so light came in through a hole in the window

1271
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:47,320
through the lens and then got banned and dispersed into the different colors so you

1272
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:51,370
get a spectrum here on this the different colours

1273
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:57,290
now there is the question how does the prism a color

1274
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:00,220
and a car

1275
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:03,660
i thought that the light was a train of pulses

1276
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:07,440
and is it goes through something like the prism or is reflects from a thin

1277
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:12,850
layer of oil on water something like that that changes the timing of the pulses

1278
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,250
and therefore changes the colour

1279
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,250
in to look at machine lessons

1280
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:18,750
at cock eventually nearing

1281
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:22,550
and we already heard talk of professor plato

1282
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,390
but deep kernels

1283
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,950
there's some work on people kernels

1284
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:29,850
by studied third problem and

1285
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:34,870
try to to come up with support vector machines multiple layers that can be training

1286
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:37,120
quite simple way and

1287
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:39,630
can be extended whereas many places you want

1288
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:43,550
so the contents of the talk progress follows first a

1289
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:49,330
big plate a little bit about support vector machines and especially support vector machine request

1290
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,550
because that will be in the pool

1291
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,400
of extracting features

1292
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,780
from input patterns

1293
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:01,340
we will continue with how the deep support vector machine looks like how this waned

1294
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,270
and we will most likely some experimental results

1295
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:08,400
both on ten regression problems and eight or

1296
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:10,130
classification problems

1297
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:17,520
so in general machine learning as you know there's a lot of applications both think classification and regression

1298
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:19,840
but also in the that control like

1299
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:22,420
my background is reinforcement learning

1300
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:27,640
i made a lot of like cain playing programs like commercial planes

1301
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:30,260
as well for like shares cameron

1302
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:35,160
also class thing out like the text is all particle

1303
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,940
like a big ball like data different methods that machine learning

1304
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:42,720
so in general use data

1305
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,870
you to give us a lot of data stored

1306
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:49,570
yeah obama data about four with data to get northwards

1307
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,310
through the formal model

1308
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:59,240
so some example applications with work for me is like seeing classification face recognition emotion recognition

1309
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:03,670
and also object recognition sorry i have also worked on this

1310
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:05,780
golf that datasets

1311
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:13,740
well about support vector machines of course data perform use much better especially when there are

1312
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:15,930
many input features

1313
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:17,770
and very few

1314
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:18,790
inputs are

1315
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,940
fed fuel examples

1316
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:23,700
then de yeah the best choice

1317
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:29,540
yeah they're like shallow models are also of support said

1318
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:35,750
well the deep architectures can perform better we have to find another notch the word for it but kind of like

1319
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:37,810
this method result in the frame going

1320
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:38,750
deep way

1321
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,490
and they're five study this problem to do this support vector machines

1322
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:46,830
so in general deep architectures have had the best results

1323
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:49,500
now many image recognition datasets

1324
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:52,350
and just jewel like millions of parameters

1325
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:54,210
because it's

1326
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:57,960
that don't use kernels that don't loofe exhibit your space

1327
01:23:58,090 --> 01:24:00,630
it's still very fast developed examples

1328
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,300
because they don't have to compute a similarity matrix

1329
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:05,530
which is kind of complicated

1330
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:08,370
life big data use kernel methods

1331
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:14,790
another thing is like support vector machines that results all fundamental law all the chosen kernel

1332
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:19,600
but kernels not flexible i mean most people just solution rbf kernel

1333
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:24,350
maybe some other grows they compare with but most the ball like if you

1334
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:26,860
look farm bio-informatics and chemistry they

1335
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:29,220
would just support vector machines as a tool

1336
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:31,760
just use radial basis function kernels

1337
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,160
and shown like sigma parameter

1338
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,630
this off like going combining kernels that kernel learning

1339
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:42,920
at all solved deep support vector machine

1340
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,370
is that kernel becomes much more flexible

1341
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:51,500
so the idea of the deep support vector machine is basically you think by many layers

1342
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,000
of support vector machines

1343
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,520
instead of multiple kernel learning way of weighting coefficients

1344
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,250
basically the wall method

1345
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,770
consists of like support vector machines

1346
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:03,410
which are like support vector coefficients

1347
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,800
and by shatters

1348
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:07,420
there's nothing our this has been shown this system

1349
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:14,330
to support vector machines requester because yeah we use the text

1350
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:16,970
features because it should be configured features

1351
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:24,310
yeah yeah basically based on the theory of structural risk averse taste developed by

1352
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,300
vapnik six is ready

1353
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:28,800
and the idea is to have a function

1354
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:35,200
of them

1355
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:40,530
the reason is

1356
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:46,410
the city hall

1357
01:25:58,110 --> 01:26:00,790
the station

1358
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,210
so far

1359
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:13,890
these all

1360
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:24,310
and this is all

1361
01:26:54,350 --> 01:27:08,870
she was

1362
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,420
you see

1363
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:29,770
i don't

1364
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:40,900
while on

1365
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:21,230
all i will

1366
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:30,530
but this is

1367
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:57,570
and not busy

1368
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:51,290
she is

1369
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:01,870
is is

1370
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:05,100
i used

1371
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:30,960
c one use

1372
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:46,810
all these

1373
01:30:54,330 --> 01:31:04,080
and you we can see this

1374
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:18,980
results of

1375
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:42,480
this is

1376
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:09,870
she is more

1377
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:11,770
so long

1378
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:17,520
he is

1379
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:57,170
is you

1380
01:33:57,170 --> 01:34:00,170
he is

1381
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:25,060
so this should be so much

1382
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:33,350
i will show you how

1388
01:35:01,870 --> 01:35:07,340
a few announcements tomorrow quiz 2 based on homework to Thursday will be the periodic

1389
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:12,870
table quiz on Member all you have to do is still in the wild wanted

1390
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:16,970

1393
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:32,260
can do the lanthanides and actinides both are test 1 will be a week from

1394
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:36,020
Wednesday then I will say something about that

1395
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:37,910
later in the week

1396
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:45,820
and I will be available 332 432 for for office hours of someone wishes to

1397
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:47,080
drop in

1398
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:53,280
last day we talked about the validation of the boar model we saw that the

1399
01:35:53,280 --> 01:36:01,660
boar model was able to correlate the observations of instrument which had been formulated by

1400
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:05,200
Baldwin and furthermore the concept of

1401
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:10,150
energy level quantization of was observed

1402
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:15,330
In the mercury is during the course of the front hurts experiment giving credence to

1403
01:36:15,330 --> 01:36:20,100
the notion that quantization of energy levels is not the property of

1404
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:26,660
1 electron atoms alone but it's something that is more broadly applicable so was validated

1405
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:33,430
and very very strong measure but there were also some contrary data and we saw

1406
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:39,210
those 1st there was the observation by Michael who back in the late 18 eighties

1407
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:46,790
and very precise interferometric measurements of the hydrogen lines and had observed that the 656

1408
01:36:47,390 --> 01:36:51,600
line associated with the transition from n equals 3 n equals 2 was in fact

1409
01:36:51,660 --> 01:36:56,450
Dublin you look really carefully defined it was not a single line 2 lines and

1410
01:36:56,450 --> 01:37:05,600
borders silent on such matters and then we had xenon who conducted the experiment of

1411
01:37:05,630 --> 01:37:12,100
hydrogen emission spectrum is a magnetic field and he found line splitting in the magnetic

1412
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:17,000
field and furthermore that the intensity of the splitting was proportional to the intensity of

1413
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:25,070
the applied magnetic field again the boar model silent about these are splitting into multiple

1414
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:31,570
levels and subsequent stock did the analogous experiment but with an electric field and again

1415
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:37,260
in an electric field line splitting observed the intensity of the line splitting varying with

1416
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:41,600
the intensity of the applied electric field so there are some problems here

1417
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:44,630
Sommerfeld came to the rescue in 1960

1418
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:51,950
preserved the the broad concept of energy levels but he put some fine structure the

1419
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:56,230
fine structure involved taking those levels that

1420
01:37:56,440 --> 01:38:02,500
quantified with the number on and assigning to those who levels and a little bit

1421
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,940
of energy with

1422
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:09,600
so that there is a plurality of orbits

1423
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:13,640
some circular in a sum little bit of circular

1424
01:38:13,690 --> 01:38:19,790
and that bandwidth he called the shelf this is the shell model in order to

1425
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:22,280
label the various

1426
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:27,110
orbitals as he called them introduced to more quantum numbers l and and we saw

1427
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:33,540
last day and then at the very end of the lecture we saw the last

1428
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,270
what you see here

1429
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:40,450
so compared the british with the german about

1430
01:38:40,610 --> 01:38:45,800
two hundred three hundred percent better

1431
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:47,770
so they really don't know anything

1432
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:53,460
but consider that this may in part be

1433
01:38:53,570 --> 01:38:56,540
this always immediately due to this twenty percent

1434
01:38:56,570 --> 01:38:59,790
production i think it's two hundred thousand

1435
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,780
the key is another example of spain

1436
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:08,040
they are slightly more realistic

1437
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:14,550
and it goes to together with the less you say that the best one of

1438
01:39:14,550 --> 01:39:15,970
the russians

1439
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:18,250
because not because they better informed

1440
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:21,120
but there are less informed

1441
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:22,730
so let's misinformed

1442
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:29,080
note spanish meaning doesn't make the golden it doesn't know anything

1443
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,930
that was the first

1444
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:34,020
and the lesson was

1445
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:36,030
one theory

1446
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:37,620
widespread way

1447
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:42,730
to communicate the effect of screening or five year survival rates

1448
01:39:42,730 --> 01:39:46,990
five years survival it's misleading in the context of screen

1449
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:55,130
there are serious correlated this mortality is but they used by medical institutions by politicians

1450
01:39:55,130 --> 01:39:56,300
and policies

1451
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:59,040
to mislead the public

1452
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,260
you are

1453
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:02,750
involved in teaching statistics

1454
01:40:02,890 --> 01:40:07,590
you need to prepare the next generation to understand these things

1455
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:12,100
and also within statistics there are some things that are more useful than it

1456
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:14,640
i would say

1457
01:40:14,650 --> 01:40:20,250
understanding five-year survival rates is more useful for the general public the confidence intervals to

1458
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,280
p values

1459
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:24,260
but in the talk

1460
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:25,600
the second

1461
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:27,600
of the three ways to

1462
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:30,550
mislead the public conditional probabilities

1463
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:37,100
so p values the conditional probability and the studies that we and others have done

1464
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:41,600
we university professors was also teach statistics course students

1465
01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:45,590
revealed that image or doesn't understand what p values

1466
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:51,540
they confused the direction of the conditional probabilities and all those kind of things

1467
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:57,890
that's also remarkable differences instance psychology known for teaching students at least for two semesters

1468
01:40:57,890 --> 01:41:02,050
in statistics and the result is a ritual mostly

1469
01:41:02,070 --> 01:41:03,540
not undistinguished

1470
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,530
conditional probability

1471
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:09,540
let's start

1472
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:12,270
with standard situation

1473
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:16,990
happens to every woman aged fifty and older

1474
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:19,570
and that's the way it's being advertised

1475
01:41:19,590 --> 01:41:26,590
ten to twenty year-olds consequences the i things that are particularly prone to breast cancer

1476
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:31,260
i'll try something with you

1477
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:36,090
i will give you know the information about breast cancer

1478
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:38,220
in four

1479
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:42,800
that's called conditional probabilities that still a medical student get

1480
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:48,860
and if ask you what you tell women who just tested positive screen

1481
01:41:48,940 --> 01:41:50,120
i hope

1482
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:54,240
that most of you are confused

1483
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:58,750
i know this is a very special audience but there's still hope to list

1484
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:00,220
many are confused

1485
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:04,320
if you are confused and you can feel what they

1486
01:42:04,370 --> 01:42:08,190
the state of most of the doctors is that of trained

1487
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:11,020
there are confused by these numbers

1488
01:42:11,030 --> 01:42:13,850
and then i will give you a different representation

1489
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:18,100
the turns confusion into inside it's just the representation

1490
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:23,570
so that avoids to send his doctors into statistics course which they would never go

1491
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:24,830
because they have

1492
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:30,090
gone to a minimum of statistical education and i learned as many doctors believe that

1493
01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:32,100
have no statistics g

1494
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:35,860
and it's just teaching

1495
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,700
so are you ready

1496
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:39,310
being the subject OK

1497
01:42:39,330 --> 01:42:44,820
you conduct screening mammography screening what you know about the population is the following

1498
01:42:44,870 --> 01:42:49,670
the chains to the women this group has breast cancer is one percent

1499
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:56,540
if she has breast cancer the probability that she tests positive is ninety percent

1500
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:57,540
and third

1501
01:42:57,540 --> 01:43:02,490
if she does not have breast cancer the probability that you nevertheless test

1502
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,780
the positive is nine percent

1503
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:09,440
so we have the prevalence of base rate of one percent is sensitivity or hit

1504
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:14,940
rate of ninety percent and the false positive rate of nine percent is woman

1505
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:16,780
she just has to pass

1506
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:19,340
she ask your doctor tell me

1507
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:20,860
you have no press cancer

1508
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,790
or what are the chances

1509
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:25,860
it is ninety nine percent nineteen fifty tell me

1510
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:28,840
but i know how to sleep

1511
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:31,970
what do tell

1512
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,060
that's all you know it screening

1513
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:40,460
you know you can just typing typing typing monkeys shakespear what not and eventually you

1514
01:43:40,460 --> 01:43:43,590
can get away something that kind of work changing the world plus one minus one

1515
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:48,050
or one move your copy-and-paste this there were i changed that name that in the

1516
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:53,690
unlikely program that from external appearances works you know place hang whatever was the

1517
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:54,740
the desired goal

1518
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:56,630
but the internally is a mess

1519
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:00,810
it's not well structured it's not well commented it's not easy to understand it would

1520
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:06,020
be easy to modify it makes a lot of decisions that really suboptimal and were

1521
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:12,540
we're really interested in producing engineers that have a good sense of design and i

1522
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:17,290
really appreciate what is involved in writing good software well designed software not just working

1523
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:22,330
software so we will be giving you feedback on both kind of the correctness functionality

1524
01:44:22,330 --> 01:44:28,920
of code but in this is important if not more so also on how how

1525
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:33,100
well we think you did designing and implementing and and writing code that is a

1526
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,970
high quality so i made a big deal out of that is something that is

1527
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:39,460
not shared by other classes and so if you someone who was self-taught or in

1528
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:42,270
a class that didn't emphasise this might feel that there's a little bit of get

1529
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:44,150
there we need to kind of make up with you

1530
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:47,430
and we can work with you because in fact this is a very individual because

1531
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:50,800
there's not one good example of the perfect style that

1532
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:54,110
in the way that a lot of different people

1533
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:56,460
express themselves in written communication

1534
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:59,380
very well but differently the same thing is true about programs right you will have

1535
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:02,710
your own unique style and work with you to kind of coach one on getting

1536
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:04,080
your style come through

1537
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:06,140
and the beautiful now

1538
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:12,590
this comes back to almost point one is well that we make heavy use of

1539
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:16,240
undergraduate section leaders as matters in this program so we have a staff of fifty

1540
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:20,340
or so undergraduates who worked with the one of six a BMX courses as the

1541
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:27,000
team and they have specific responsibilities with their section so mentoring and integrating and then

1542
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:28,190
meeting with the

1543
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:32,490
section is on their to give individualized feedback on the programs such as well as

1544
01:45:32,490 --> 01:45:37,100
just the question solving problems being in the layer thirty plus hours their most weekday

1545
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:41,920
nights about six hours and often well past midnight when exposed to cut off to

1546
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:45,970
solve people's problems helping you when you get a little stock answering your questions and

1547
01:45:45,970 --> 01:45:49,670
making sure that you can all making forward progress and that comes back to point

1548
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:53,150
one that then some universities i think where choosing to use their intercourse is kind

1549
01:45:53,150 --> 01:45:56,650
of a leader like well separate the wheat from the chaff early and let's make

1550
01:45:56,650 --> 01:46:00,260
it really hard not not provide too much support that we will make sure we

1551
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:04,620
get people we want to have a different idea the programming is hard especially when

1552
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:08,070
you're learning there's a lot of complexity the master and a lot of

1553
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:11,340
details that they can interfere with kind of moving forward and we don't want you

1554
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:14,730
to to to get stuck on something that we can very easily result three is

1555
01:46:14,730 --> 01:46:18,440
to try and make sure you have access to all staff members in person in

1556
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:25,340
email regularly in section to help get through roadblocks and keep you moving forward

1557
01:46:25,390 --> 01:46:29,510
what you need to know to be sure you knew well

1558
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:34,350
people who think that you know to be a good computer programmer you could mass

1559
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:37,970
you need to be good at logic you need to be good

1560
01:46:37,990 --> 01:46:44,310
drinking joel i don't actually if it comes down to more personality traits and i

1561
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:46,000
think any particular

1562
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:48,950
technique to scale like you know you don't need to be good at math writing

1563
01:46:49,150 --> 01:46:52,190
you know how much you know calculus and trick shows up and this does not

1564
01:46:52,190 --> 01:46:54,850
very much relevant logic that helps you know

1565
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:58,480
i think it comes down to more things like tricks like curiosity and determination hard

1566
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:04,190
work that starting early asking questions when you don't understand something try to solve the

1567
01:47:04,190 --> 01:47:07,110
problem by logic i think is very valuable and how to think about how to

1568
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:12,070
make makes that's why this case works and why that case doesn't work right thinking

1569
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:13,630
about that logically

1570
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:20,650
like the movie it all the way to think about but then i think these

1571
01:47:20,650 --> 01:47:23,840
are the skills that actually be the best and they said it best in this

1572
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:28,190
class and probably every other thing you want to tackle but there's a lot of

1573
01:47:28,190 --> 01:47:32,810
time that we spend here to master this i can talk about programming only one

1574
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:36,360
global y and you know it makes less sense but when you write it yourself

1575
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:40,420
right it's a very different experience and that's where you know being being kind of

1576
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:45,490
focused on staying on task and getting help when you get stuck can help you

1577
01:47:45,490 --> 01:47:47,100
move through that

1578
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:48,710
all right

1579
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:52,450
and questions about one-sixth but we do why do we do

1580
01:47:52,510 --> 01:47:57,040
that has nothing to say your afraid of having a voice recorder

1581
01:47:57,060 --> 01:48:00,220
world on your parents will come and see that you come to class you can

1582
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:01,820
prove it

1583
01:48:01,970 --> 01:48:02,750
all right

1584
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:07,110
my unbiased opinion about why one a six b is one of the best courses

1585
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:08,720
at stanford

1586
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:12,680
i'm not almost

1587
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:14,710
actually can be

1588
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:18,230
very useful when thinking about holistic wall

1589
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:22,330
i've got something here to decide this might imply

1590
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:26,340
and i want to know how all the pixels in my template move given that

1591
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:32,450
i want the pixels to be coherent to a certain primitive what what kind of

1592
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:36,870
saying there is that a lot of one top flight

1593
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:39,460
and i know that

1594
01:48:39,470 --> 01:48:43,300
so save translation i want all these pixels to move the same amount

1595
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:48,270
and things so if i look at these so that the pixel coherence assumption i

1596
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:50,270
can cannot that this pixel here

1597
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:54,970
given displacement i can predict pretty well because there's a high correlation between these

1598
01:48:55,050 --> 01:48:58,010
and if i look at these or in individual cases i can do a very

1599
01:48:58,010 --> 01:49:00,780
good job of predicting what the whole

1600
01:49:00,790 --> 01:49:02,280
translation should be

1601
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:04,410
in looking at individual pixels

1602
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:09,470
similarly so that's translation so you get well what about other things what scale

1603
01:49:09,550 --> 01:49:14,800
skeleton exact same thing because i worried about translation at the pixel level

1604
01:49:14,820 --> 01:49:16,610
but the damage what

1605
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:20,100
it's actually more holistic so

1606
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:23,990
i can i know that there is a high correlation between so this position in

1607
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:26,240
this position in in in in in

1608
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:31,360
an image and if i got constraint that all the movements of these have two

1609
01:49:32,110 --> 01:49:34,620
two of parametric what they scale

1610
01:49:35,330 --> 01:49:39,310
i can do a very good job here predicting this movement without having to exhaustively

1611
01:49:39,310 --> 01:49:43,840
search over scales i know that it's individual pixels related to one another and so

1612
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:47,110
i can kind of based on this really simple

1613
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:50,920
domain knowledge i can actually come up with a kind of a clever way of

1614
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:56,870
solving this exhaustive search problem and we will contact from on the same again motion

1615
01:49:56,870 --> 01:50:01,860
fields rotations and things like that and so on and so forth and so that's

1616
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:06,560
why i kind of like this pixel coherence assumption is so useful

1617
01:50:09,650 --> 01:50:13,980
and so it is the pixel coherence assumption is useful across all wall and so

1618
01:50:14,090 --> 01:50:18,120
most natural images like places and things like that

1619
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:23,220
so another is the pixel coherence assumption is good is that now let's say that

1620
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:25,610
i trying to

1621
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:29,060
the this this box detection

1622
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:31,870
and this is what template

1623
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:35,430
and this is the input image so i'm going to go into here

1624
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,480
i cannot sample every point

1625
01:50:37,490 --> 01:50:43,600
now the nice thing about the pixel coherence assumption it's it basically ensures that even

1626
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:48,850
if this this is slightly misaligned because of this most graceful degradation in the in

1627
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:50,670
the in the autocorrelation function

1628
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:53,570
i can still get a reasonable maxscore here

1629
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:58,670
actually still pretty pretty good job so as as i said above threshold appropriately even

1630
01:50:58,670 --> 01:51:02,970
though it's slightly misaligned it'll it'll it'll still do a good job and again that

1631
01:51:02,970 --> 01:51:07,440
doesn't apply to all TV signals some TV signals that might have nothing but edges

1632
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:11,500
or lots of of noise and things are slightly misaligned those two singles

1633
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:13,670
they'll be completely uncorrelated in one match

1634
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:19,470
the the assumption that i've got some sort of coherent here actually enables me to

1635
01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:22,510
get a good idea of how i should sample

1636
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:27,720
what space because i'm i've got a good idea of of perhaps how these image

1637
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:30,290
image pixels across to each other

1638
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:43,510
well yes i mean this as so there is there there are probably probably physical

1639
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:47,690
physical attributes of kind of like a national natural natural laws of physics and things

1640
01:51:47,690 --> 01:51:53,610
that kind of governing things and also perhaps it could also about you like i

1641
01:51:55,730 --> 01:51:59,590
give me something that had taken evolutionary thing to do that we we kind of

1642
01:52:00,730 --> 01:52:05,260
we did that the visual system to come to take advantage of

1643
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:08,370
what's out there in the world and what we tend to observe what we need

1644
01:52:08,370 --> 01:52:09,220
to observe

1645
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:12,640
the center and the center is a lot of information in the low frequencies are

1646
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:14,790
not so much information behind free

1647
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,330
and so could be

1648
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:22,290
and essentially or more pragmatic way is that this is the universe we live in

1649
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:25,880
let's take advantage of that of the mind so kind of chicken and the egg

1650
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:30,810
it's a philosophical question asking why like that but i think the coping in computer

1651
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:33,330
vision and this is kind of what i'm trying to say

1652
01:52:33,370 --> 01:52:37,140
that's a nice thing in computer vision is that if you look at some of

1653
01:52:37,140 --> 01:52:40,980
these redundancies in the human visual system in what's going on in images you can

1654
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:43,680
actually make you learning algorithms a lot better

1655
01:52:43,870 --> 01:52:46,690
rather than kind of going to things lively

1656
01:52:46,930 --> 01:52:53,570
again there might be slight degradation again it's still matches the c as the object

1657
01:52:53,610 --> 01:52:56,440
but obviously we can only go so far

1658
01:52:56,520 --> 01:53:03,060
if things are completely different then things start falling apart and it's county so we

1659
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:07,350
don't have to sample every pixel we can actually be smart about where sampling and

1660
01:53:07,350 --> 01:53:13,350
we can actually look at the space discreetly without losing too much information

1661
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:16,670
and this is kind of what a lot of modern-day things things OK so let's

1662
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:20,340
let's go to the example let's say about my vector p

1663
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:26,570
and p one is perhaps translation experts who is translation want to be anything could

1664
01:53:26,570 --> 01:53:32,900
be maybe rotation scale whatever you like and let's assume that i'm going to have

1665
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:36,650
their own and were concerned so obviously if i go too far outside the image

1666
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:41,890
it stops and things but at the moment our assumption is that well it's continued

1667
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:45,640
i can i can go anywhere in here is continuous i can get to it

1668
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:49,710
from the ground granularity which would take infinite computations

1669
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:53,140
so what the pixel coherence assumption allows you to do is that we make as

1670
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:56,570
but assumptions about where we judge

1671
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:58,640
and generally now

1672
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:01,590
i think people will be looking for the next slide of well OK so you

1673
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:06,370
can't get this cycling here is the kind theory on how much jump should be

1674
01:54:06,370 --> 01:54:09,850
made unfortunately a lot of a lot the time whatever

1675
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:13,600
this is essentially based on heuristics is based on what on what on what works

1676
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:18,510
so people typically ten to scale and only search images in terms of of so

1677
01:54:18,510 --> 01:54:21,410
four introduction

1678
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:24,080
and i would like to

1679
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:26,470
talk about microscopy course

1680
01:54:26,590 --> 01:54:29,690
there is no reason across nations

1681
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:33,970
today focus patient you which is given below

1682
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:34,740
and so

1683
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:37,490
last year she

1684
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:38,830
that's it

1685
01:54:38,850 --> 01:54:41,900
and maybe the SEM as you know

1686
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:45,500
this method is called i don't see them

1687
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:51,360
that means some kind of a scanning electron microscopy to use and also was a

1688
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:55,590
solution to result microscopy

1689
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:57,200
so the basic principle

1690
01:54:57,210 --> 01:54:59,340
o this you

1691
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:03,950
we have very fine being its conversion

1692
01:55:03,970 --> 01:55:06,050
and this is

1693
01:55:06,070 --> 01:55:08,160
what is this

1694
01:55:08,170 --> 01:55:11,800
it's all that means is transmitted

1695
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:14,300
the electrons

1696
01:55:14,310 --> 01:55:21,860
and on this or so this is the rules of the high angle scattered electrons

1697
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:27,190
now let's go to the exterior walls of the cylinder not six

1698
01:55:27,210 --> 01:55:28,680
so the whole signal

1699
01:55:28,690 --> 01:55:30,950
that we actually say

1700
01:55:30,970 --> 01:55:33,330
you are the high list

1701
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:35,390
get also to

1702
01:55:37,210 --> 01:55:40,580
now if look at the usually this is

1703
01:55:40,620 --> 01:55:42,350
you can see them

1704
01:55:42,360 --> 01:55:44,410
a very small holes

1705
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:49,550
we get this right inflections which are listed and is responsible for most of the

1706
01:55:49,550 --> 01:55:53,390
work which is down here i would hear

1707
01:55:56,510 --> 01:55:57,510
o bonds

1708
01:55:57,530 --> 01:56:00,000
thirty four new radios

1709
01:56:04,280 --> 01:56:06,380
so this was

1710
01:56:06,430 --> 01:56:08,070
the high heels

1711
01:56:08,090 --> 01:56:10,080
the only thing that

1712
01:56:11,070 --> 01:56:14,120
now you want to yes

1713
01:56:14,330 --> 01:56:16,480
some information on the chemistry

1714
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:21,480
so that means that this is the record depends on the average number of the

1715
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:25,040
columns of them and you get the best

1716
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:26,520
this is the right

1717
01:56:26,530 --> 01:56:28,400
i would say

1718
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:32,480
he who is not easy to

1719
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:39,460
but you see it has some kind of correlation between the atomic numbers and intensity

1720
01:56:41,170 --> 01:56:45,530
get more so

1721
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:47,830
this type of scattering

1722
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:50,400
so these kinds of france

1723
01:56:50,620 --> 01:56:55,180
greece on the inside face data that can be huge

1724
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:01,690
you to use the word because it was

1725
01:57:01,700 --> 01:57:05,810
the following is rescued elephants

1726
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:08,770
i just summarized

1727
01:57:10,550 --> 01:57:14,780
so this is a kind the of sense

1728
01:57:14,830 --> 01:57:17,720
first it you had columns

1729
01:57:17,730 --> 01:57:19,560
every number

1730
01:57:19,610 --> 01:57:21,370
this is very important

1731
01:57:21,410 --> 01:57:24,190
it is approximately square

1732
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:27,320
and there is a conflict resolution

1733
01:57:27,330 --> 01:57:32,570
here we have not been as you know in first case is

1734
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:36,210
the change of

1735
01:57:36,230 --> 01:57:39,480
it means that we have almost always

1736
01:57:39,490 --> 01:57:42,920
this is you might what is

1737
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:45,000
is independent of the book

1738
01:57:47,180 --> 01:57:50,730
and this is why call it the nation's images

1739
01:57:52,270 --> 01:57:56,700
we said we see as follows which is you know

1740
01:57:57,040 --> 01:58:01,960
is called the ones which have high atomic numbers

1741
01:58:02,010 --> 01:58:06,700
but for some reason i talked about it was the interpretation

1742
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:07,860
we see

1743
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:09,820
is not people

1744
01:58:09,870 --> 01:58:11,570
we also need

1745
01:58:11,590 --> 01:58:18,390
simulations calculations matching of the experiment is the use

1746
01:58:18,410 --> 01:58:20,370
now we can to do

1747
01:58:20,390 --> 01:58:21,930
search across the

1748
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:25,480
well first of all it was given

1749
01:58:25,550 --> 01:58:29,430
that's what you need attention to

1750
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:31,420
microscope which

1751
01:58:31,430 --> 01:58:37,780
there are also

1752
01:58:37,890 --> 01:58:40,390
actually go about this

1753
01:58:40,410 --> 01:58:42,330
four rules

1754
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:43,790
this is

1755
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:49,110
so this is time

1756
01:58:49,190 --> 01:58:54,070
that really has a very slow growth very small size

1757
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:57,200
size of the

1758
01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:01,720
so for me is roughly three to four

1759
01:59:01,740 --> 01:59:05,670
this is sort of scary monsters

1760
01:59:05,690 --> 01:59:07,770
there other

1761
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:09,630
important events

1762
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:14,780
say a procedures this kind of stuff

1763
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:16,300
first of all you know

1764
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:18,420
see history

1765
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:21,120
so we have some operations

1766
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:26,240
and see is correct structures you would get much

1767
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:28,810
this one

1768
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:32,120
so is one of the solutions

1769
01:59:33,450 --> 01:59:36,570
i would love this statement

1770
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:38,610
we have

1771
01:59:38,630 --> 01:59:45,660
and way in which means conversion which you can also spaces

1772
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:47,730
and of course the

1773
01:59:48,120 --> 01:59:50,760
he was also very important

1774
01:59:50,780 --> 01:59:53,190
now this is from the

1775
01:59:53,310 --> 01:59:54,410
it means

1776
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:55,970
we need know all

1777
01:59:55,990 --> 01:59:59,260
less scary

1778
01:59:59,330 --> 02:00:02,450
and specimen thickness is also very important

1779
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:05,070
this operation is especially people

1780
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:08,720
seven image

1781
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:10,870
i would just show the differences

1782
02:00:11,660 --> 02:00:13,440
so this is
