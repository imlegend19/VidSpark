1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
and then we also focus on that last number there

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,610
so what i'm going to do is the following

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:18,910
i going think about looking at the correlation matrix of the following vector

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,820
right so what i could do is i could take groups

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:35,020
i'm gonna make a vector is a vector in four dimensions

6
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,790
it's random vector it's got one on the first coordinate x one x two x

7
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,290
three and then i'm going to take that column vector an outer product with the

8
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,390
row vector and take the expectation of that and i'm going to look at what

9
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,290
i get

10
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,130
you have a question

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,730
right so what happens

12
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,440
we can sort of read off the first row the first row is like the

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,850
expectation of one times one that's one one times x one that's mu one

14
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,950
but if you look at how i define mu one one times x two expectations

15
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,700
mu two and u three

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,850
now the second row should look like this

17
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,760
can somebody explain why the second row should look like that

18
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:21,870
right these are all moments

19
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,910
so i think the only interesting one is why is the diagonal mu one

20
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:33,030
right because it's binary if you take expectation of x one squared

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,050
that's equal to x one expectation x one so you get you that on the

22
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,180
columns that using the binary nest when i start to get the products get x

23
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,560
one times x two i get mu one mu two

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,370
we're sorry you want to use two three so i feel this out i get

25
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,010
a four by four matrix

26
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,810
right now filled with moments

27
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,950
moments or i cherry-picked elements of my marginal

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:01,310
what can we say about that matrix

29
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,620
right to be positive semi definite

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,010
we do not guarantee this so nonnegative i can values

31
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,660
right so if you go back and look at this example that i gave to

32
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,890
you earlier this one right here

33
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,160
if you plug those numbers

34
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,510
right these numbers

35
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,140
this around plugging them into this matrix and you take the determiner just compute the

36
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,700
i can values to see it's not positive definite

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,350
or semidefinite

38
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,030
right so that's telling us that that violate

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,910
these constraints

40
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,810
that's i think the quickest way you can check this other ways but that's a

41
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,490
very quick way

42
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,700
right and that's actually very useful way because this is the convex constraints and probably

43
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,390
even mention this that when you take these are called linear matrix inequalities when you

44
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,530
linear functions of whatever parameters are interested in and you require that things are positive

45
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,220
semi definite that's like cone membership constraint you're saying in the positive definite semidefinite cone

46
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:04,240
so that's convex so you can imagine adding that constraint to LP relaxation and you

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,810
would get a hybrid you get something like step is an LP plus an SDP

48
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,200
etc etc it's better relaxation

49
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,310
so there's been some study of these things and has been more in in computers

50
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,780
are theoretical computer science in combinatorics but machine learning i don't think these things have

51
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,760
been exploited as much as they could be

52
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,240
part of the issues algorithm of course in machine learning we have very large scale

53
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,030
problems lps are very easy to solve expecially when they're graph structured so you can

54
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,870
do message passing but i think various people are working on fast ways of solving

55
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,410
sdps and so i think this is an interesting direction to look at things like

56
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,200
this and these types of constraints

57
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,890
so let me walk a bit more slowly you jumped us all crawl and then

58
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,370
so for binary problems i was exploring things like this happen that expectation of x

59
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,780
one square is mu one there's nothing specific about this approach to binary if you

60
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,870
had a general the discrete variables you can just use this you have to take

61
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,810
an indicator vector for to equal one two three you have and many states you

62
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,700
have to blow up the matrix

63
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,930
you're exactly right if you have continuous problems

64
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,720
you could again define functions of your continuous random vector and impose these kinds of

65
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,490
so there is for those of you interested this sort of a much more general

66
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,850
theory of this

67
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,890
related to what's called polynomial programming by this air jones

68
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,370
c is a series of very nice papers about semidefinite relaxations and hierarchies the sort

69
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,680
of the canonical hierarchy that works for continuous things he's not thinking about graphical models

70
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,100
he's coming from a very different point of view but his techniques certainly have nice

71
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,810
consequences for graphical models

72
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:13,330
any other questions

73
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:25,060
OK so the question is why do what did i do this weird thing what

74
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,260
i put a constant random variable

75
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,250
so the reason that i mean this is what lesser does its part of a

76
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,470
special case general scheme but the reason for that is that if you didn't put

77
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,010
the one you get the submatrix

78
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,780
right so that's OK

79
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,390
but the constraint the extra thing you get by adding this row is good it

80
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,410
helps you for instance

81
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,700
this submatrix right here

82
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,390
this two by two submatrix on these variables

83
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,680
that two by two submatrix is positive semi definite this is actually equivalent to the

84
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,600
linear programming constraint

85
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,410
right because this is making

86
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:12,580
sorry if you add one more row two it becomes equivalent to the LP constraint

87
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,910
so in general you want to i mean modular computational complexity you want to add

88
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,950
whatever you can to the SDP and this is just one rho so it's it's

89
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,200
not bad

90
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,830
the way you generalize this of course is you can see the generalisation right instead

91
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,990
of one x one x two x three i could now take x one times

92
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:35,080
x two x two times x we have to keep lifting so these these sequences

93
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,560
relaxations of people study for instance these are called lifting the procedures is called lifting

94
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,740
because you're taking your original problem and you're listening to higher spaces and getting better

95
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:52,160
so there there are nice very powerful but again there is a trade-off with computation

96
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,220
yes i think this is worth exploring more

97
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,580
i think there's some jews in these

98
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,440
now we have

99
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,020
three these of processes

100
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,380
it means here

101
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,270
have axis of

102
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,630
we have also

103
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,730
this is a very particular kind of approximation

104
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,150
fogelson would have and square root

105
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,460
we impose also a particular structure

106
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,900
she was saying that

107
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,480
like terms

108
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,400
in fact

109
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,580
the only way

110
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,960
there is hope

111
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,170
to each other

112
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,730
i j

113
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,650
the result was respected

114
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,960
of the of the system

115
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,520
so now

116
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,370
we need to look at

117
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,730
you can the try likelihood the job is going to be

118
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,730
i just want to gaussians

119
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,500
must all these

120
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,230
that's why situation

121
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:21,920
to be

122
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,270
for example the utility is the vector

123
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,560
it is

124
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,790
sigma two

125
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,250
matrix here is that the matrix

126
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:46,110
OK so now we can work out our result

127
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,900
approximation to the posterior

128
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,130
to do that by in

129
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:03,230
and that is how to choose from

130
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,250
what is actually good

131
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:10,980
that values to use these problems

132
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,100
the key idea to me

133
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,040
he is should

134
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,380
it's a

135
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,730
based on the observations of

136
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,850
what i mean

137
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,980
if you look at at the posterior distribution for

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
to size

139
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,850
it has the highest

140
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,040
this country fire

141
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,810
which tells you how to

142
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,600
smooth line

143
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,730
terms from cases

144
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,080
so this is defined by case

145
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,730
these representative

146
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,830
approximation of

147
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,750
all these like terms are approximated

148
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,670
that's not the case

149
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,560
which is exactly what i

150
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,060
what we do is

151
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,670
we can actually handle

152
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,710
the one-dimensional version of gas

153
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,830
this single it can actually be wrong

154
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,190
what's going on

155
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,610
great job

156
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,290
problem into a series of one

157
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,350
by using

158
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,250
approximation are all of

159
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,940
one thing which is

160
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,190
what is

161
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,000
activation of

162
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,770
i see

163
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,080
you might decide that

164
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,040
what is the

165
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,600
distribution over

166
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,750
if i leave

167
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,500
i observation

168
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,480
why are you here as

169
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,270
approximate likelihood terms is

170
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,940
all of this is that

171
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,960
this is things all

172
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,960
now again

173
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,100
that's the easiest way to find that look at the

174
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,000
joint distribution with all the

175
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,880
all right

176
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,830
here is part of

177
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,130
you want to find

178
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,920
they a

179
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,790
the main thing is that the

180
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,290
at iteration

181
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,310
it is

182
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,810
that's she had mean

183
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,770
so i and then

184
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,630
it was red

185
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,000
so now we we have to

186
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,650
what is the what

187
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,500
approximately wire has been

188
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,170
the last thing we need to

189
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,850
introduces the idea is to use exactly

190
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,920
we're gonna

191
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:24,540
process will habit which i

192
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,900
exact like that he

193
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,310
distribution exactly the

194
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,770
now we're going to be find

195
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,750
figure out

196
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,850
what we do best approximation

197
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,650
to use this

198
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,190
and approximate

199
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,770
i don't know

200
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:57,110
but it was

201
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,730
these are the same

202
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,500
this is that

203
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,440
so i'm here

204
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,810
like the function

205
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,580
so this is the observation

206
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,850
which one is in the underlying function

207
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,850
it should be

208
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,380
that's the

209
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,710
and like down

210
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,920
and you

211
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,710
at each something else which depends on the order of

212
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,600
o thing going on all the time all

213
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,080
now i want my like

214
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,670
you get something like this

215
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,520
looks as here

216
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,310
because like drop

217
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,690
now it's OK

218
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,270
let's try to find the best possible approximation as an approximation

219
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,100
to this day

220
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,710
sigma two

221
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,060
and now we start and with are archie

222
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,000
two p act

223
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,270
and our pi i two p while

224
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:13,380
so this is our valence electron configuration for b two

225
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:21,170
right so what would you expect the bonding water for b two to b

226
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,630
shouted out if you know

227
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,430
and i can right up there but it is one and we can see that

228
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,210
it's one because it's one have

229
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:35,060
two four minus two so what happened to the bonding water is going to be

230
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,770
equal to one

231
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,040
so let's move on to another example let's talk about carbon here again we're just

232
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,360
talking about the valence electrons so carbon has four valence electrons so we talk about

233
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,060
the two again we're going to start filling in our molecular orbitals and now we're

234
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,810
going to have eight

235
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,480
electrons to fill into our molecular orbitals so put two and sigma two as two

236
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,560
and sigma two n star

237
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,060
and now we're going to fill one-on-one into each of our pi two px and

238
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,060
two py y

239
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,100
but we still have two electrons left so what we're going to do is double

240
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,270
in terms of our two px and two py y

241
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:20,920
so let's think about what this account electron configuration is first the two

242
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,860
and again i want you to have practiced drawing out in the form you always

243
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,670
need to start with the same and then write the number of the orbit also

244
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:34,560
sigma two as it has two electrons sigma two s star

245
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,270
with two electrons

246
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:41,110
and now we have sigma two p at how many electrons here

247
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,340
and sigma two p

248
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,420
two electrons here

249
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:53,610
scuse me pi two PY thank you pi two px and py two PY

250
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,940
so let's talk about what the bonding water is going to be first CTO so

251
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,290
what's the bonding order for c two

252
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,830
two OK so

253
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,150
we have to

254
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,670
four six

255
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,940
minus two

256
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,250
so we have

257
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,690
one had

258
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,000
six minus two so that's one half of four so we have a bonding order

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,020
of two

260
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,540
for carbon two

261
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,170
so we would expect to see a double bond force the two where we would

262
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,250
expect to see

263
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:30,830
single bonds and double bond first e two a single bond for b two

264
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,920
and that is in fact what we can surmise if we look at the different

265
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,880
dissociation energies for the tube on so b two which is the single bond that's

266
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,920
two hundred eighty nine killing joules per mole the break and it takes us more

267
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,630
energy to break this double bond for carbon which is five hundred ninety nine code

268
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,670
rules from all

269
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,290
so in general what we see in this is always true for comparing the same

270
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:58,170
pattern and in general for comparing different types of molecules but we know that the

271
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,630
single bond is always weaker than the double bond which is weaker than the triple

272
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,100
bonds and obviously no bond is the weakest of all that's not bonding

273
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,150
right so let's look at now in the case where we do have two p

274
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:15,230
the orbitals that we're talking about so again what we're talking about the linear combination

275
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,110
of atomic two p orbitals an hour talking about two pv

276
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,340
so if we have a constructive interference between the two

277
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,750
what we're going to see if the atomic orbital look a molecular orbital look something

278
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,210
like this

279
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,480
to predict that this will be a sigma or pi orbital

280
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,230
right i hear a little bit of time varying current state here are quite a

281
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,310
few people think sigma this is in fact the sigma two pz orbital is what

282
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,150
this orbital is called the reason that i i think about it if you look

283
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,860
at the bonding axis here is that there is no nodal plane along the bond

284
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,440
in access

285
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,500
also it is cylindrically symmetric

286
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,040
across around the bonding axis so this is how we know that the sigma orbital

287
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,900
so some p orbitals form pi molecular orbitals in some form sigma p orbital specifically

288
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,600
it's always the

289
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:14,040
that forms the sigma orbital and the reason is at least at the minimum for

290
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:20,170
this class we always define the into nuclear axis is the axis so this is

291
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,750
always always the axis was always going to be the two p that are coming

292
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,020
together head on

293
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,900
the reason that there is increased electron density here you can see

294
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,150
that these two orbitals come together and constructively interfere

295
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:40,670
as it is and and figure out how to solve for

296
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,560
how to solve OK just so this is now a quick review of linear algebra

297
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:54,690
with apologies to those who master the subject completely in the summer and this is

298
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,410
this is I have to

299
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,430
what where my headed

300
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,060
well I have to talk about solving linear equations

301
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,490
and for what

302
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,650
part of this lecture I'll actually go through a little of the mechanic but of

303
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,100
Matlab is going to do the job for

304
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:23,150
but in the mechanics so this solving this equation by elimination so I'm going to

305
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:29,710
solve it by eliminating

306
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:37,980
so that means I do a lot of row operations right I multiply this rule

307
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:46,640
by suitable multiplier and I use it on to the next Schroeder produces 0 and

308
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:53,140
remember the key idea of solving equations as the make them systematically simpler

309
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,320
at Parliament that since spaces

310
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,730
getting shorter let medium to by 2

311
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,640
OK so take the 2 by 2 cases

312
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,240
OK so

313
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:12,560
so this is just k OK and it's got some x y equals we take

314
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,430
some whatever right hand side

315
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,600
so as

316
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,900
equals some right-hand side if 1 of 2 OK

317
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,580
OK have a system like that

318
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,540
well elimination is the way to do it

319
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,670
so what is elimination

320
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,880
it means that I

321
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,220
In words I would like to add half of that wrote to that 1

322
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,880
that would be

323
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:52,640
that would then produces this sold elimination word

324
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:58,750
and half of them the 1st equation will change to minus 1 will still multiply

325
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,930
X Y and still produce

326
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:09,060
if 1 but what will be the 2nd equation after elimination

327
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,380
so I'm going to add half of that to the

328
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,300
In order to produce said 0

329
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,270
and then when I had half of that so that's minus have added to the

330
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,650
to the left with 1 half 3

331
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:31,360
x y and here I have ever 1 plus the fact of the 2 of

332
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:36,320
if 2 is what I had and I added on half of 1

333
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,640
the right

334
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,880
again forgive me for a

335
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,580
dealing with 2 by 2 system but it's

336
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,900
see all clearly see the whole steps OK so

337
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,930
so we a multiplication

338
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,800
and I patiently copied the unknown x y

339
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,590
but that was a waste of time

340
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,650
time and space and I also followed up on the right hand side of the

341
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:12,930
due to the right hand side wanted the left but the serious

342
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:19,340
effort the thinking is all in the matrix in going from this matrix which was

343
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,600
our original matrix

344
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:29,640
so this matrix which is our matrix which we call that

345
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:35,360
good for upper upper triangular

346
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,600
so that the idea of elimination start with your matrix

347
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,800
do these row operations and end up with an upper triangular me OK

348
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,670
OK if thinking about a better give some names to some of the the numbers

349
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,600
that showing up here this number 2

350
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,720
is called the 1st paper

351
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,720
this is pivoting steps

352
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,420
so so here president change so it's still there

353
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,910
the number 2 is the 1st

354
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,470
I use it so I use that 1st pivot to clear out the column below

355
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,930
and now I'm over here

356
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,800
now I use the 2nd well I don't even actually

357
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,820
forces the last thing that I don't have anything more to do with it but

358
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:30,730
still accounts so that those appear 2 and 3 had

359
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,360
for this matrix

360
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,770
for this for this 2 by 2 this is key to

361
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,400
OK now what is that I

362
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,650
wanted to ask about k 2

363
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,400
well the same questions I asked about k 3

364
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,300
now should be easier for k to 1st of all

365
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,470
symmetric to us about all these stories

366
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:01,360
now it's it's these harder questions I'm I'm interested in is k 2

367
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:10,410
is the matrix is invertible and you don't know allowed to take it's the what's

368
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,670
I I claim that I can see from what's written on the board that invertible

369
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,900
because what

370
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,250
because once I get here I know

371
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,400
no problems I can solve the right

372
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,320
when the pivots are not 0

373
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,210
that's the test for invertibility that's not where

374
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:42,230
the pivots so invertible let me let me write that down invertible means also that

375
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:50,040
part of the non parameter never 0

376
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,050
OK but

377
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,490
i wanted it just as the set theoretic

378
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,200
all it is is to simple as that i claim

379
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,460
that i'll put evaluation

380
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,980
remember this is a maximal consistent set of formulae so the p fifty three say

381
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,380
somewhere along the line this enumeration is p fifty three

382
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,630
the been there and the negation of p fifty three is going to be

383
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,200
so what's the valuation that i put it there

384
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:29,040
happy nor p one p two on the p no p one p two dollars

385
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,300
and all i do is i second this maximal consistent set

386
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,680
and if is in a you make contribute you make it false if it's in

387
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:46,590
there you make true etcetera you see what i'm doing

388
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,720
in words

389
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:04,240
something like this

390
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,070
there is an edge from w to v

391
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,760
it's this one merely from the are in the and box

392
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,590
this one is the other way

393
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,620
all the really

394
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,550
in the

395
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,910
but diamond

396
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:51,070
so what i'm saying is unless i made the new better have diamond sign

397
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,010
OK i've already

398
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,350
it is approved there is well i not going to go through the proof

399
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,970
see if you can

400
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,310
little w and little v

401
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:22,520
i forgot to say a little w and little they are members of the big

402
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,020
w set right all consistent sets

403
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,710
sorry i should have said that

404
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,790
so t

405
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,260
is the set of all maximal consistent extension of gamma it's an infinite set

406
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,070
infinite sets of formulae

407
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,760
now what i'm going to do is take any one of those states take any

408
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,930
other of cities and i'm going to put a relation between

409
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,740
the canonical model relation

410
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,310
so this w and this these are maximal consistent set

411
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,870
of gamma

412
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,460
OK so

413
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,680
how you extend

414
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:18,530
the construction and the canonical model construction tomorrow large that's why i had done about

415
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,600
i want you to have some of which explain what's going on all the books

416
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,050
formerly from w are in the

417
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,050
the truth

418
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,570
can you see that

419
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:36,230
the membership relation here it's cashing out as truthful

420
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,650
box finding here means box Y's y

421
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,290
well wherever you go

422
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,380
five is going to be in there

423
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:52,730
so i'm going to be able to leave this membership valuation right in to bigger

424
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,040
and similarly

425
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,030
if there is a diamond signs say

426
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,350
it says well

427
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,220
there's going to be at least one

428
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,590
world which has signed

429
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,990
so the diamonds are going to be happy as well

430
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,050
that's basically the the triple technical

431
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,730
mumbo-jumbo which

432
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,750
classical logic are not going to go through the details because it takes

433
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,570
to do this it takes a long time

434
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,180
so the lemma

435
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,150
now is what

436
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,700
is the essence

437
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,370
of lifting membership

438
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,000
to what we know

439
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,970
whenever p nor using in the peano what is true that says what about logical

440
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:48,290
form can i say whenever logic formulas in it's true OK so

441
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:55,550
let's just go through if not fighting w then five million the design right because

442
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,720
we means we consistent that's that's easy

443
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,870
if i knew then this

444
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,480
so what you have to say

445
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,460
well suppose find size and i'll show flies in w inside

446
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,960
and on the reverse

447
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:16,040
and you've got the definition of maximal consistent sets that i

448
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,780
i showed you can get it and it

449
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,880
i'm not going to go through the details but the crux of these two

450
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,380
this property here

451
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,550
that's why we defined

452
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,880
because see all of this stuff is to do with truth tables all of this

453
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,280
stuff that john told you

454
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,830
i need to model stuff to go through

455
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,580
they actually got one which shows you can buy

456
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,960
what time we suppose

457
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,180
twelve thirty

458
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,950
this was

459
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,210
what do you want to see the so what you need to see what else

460
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,840
i got

461
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,190
OK so the

462
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,460
so much for for this kind of

463
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,560
inference but if you turn it again to the bottom up approach that was

464
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:27,020
mister morse and pluck the smaller

465
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:33,510
and do this he often

466
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:44,490
namely the next step was once we have obtained is kind of individuals

467
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,660
we were about to

468
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:55,030
generalized youth concept descriptions or if concept and fiona concept interesting the concept descriptions

469
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,300
pakistan done by

470
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:06,030
and inference namely these comes up some more

471
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:15,580
OK so the first we look again at the at the definition

472
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,710
so these concepts what is now

473
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,150
defined with respect to the set of input concept descriptions so this comes up some

474
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,610
of the set of concept description in certain description logic OWL

475
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,070
it's not the concept in the same description logic

476
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,900
such that it fulfills two conditions

477
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:41,590
namely again subsumes all or some of the input concepts generalize all the input and

478
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:46,940
it is again the least with respect to subsumption similar to the embassy we construct

479
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,670
a concept description of some of the best fitting

480
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,920
with respect subsumption so we cannot find another concept in the description logic that somehow

481
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,110
captures the idea

482
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,100
the common ideas of the input concepts

483
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,600
the fact so the FCS some of the best fitting concept description that we can

484
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,450
just construct in the description logic which was

485
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,390
with we

486
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,780
with which we are working

487
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,910
again i want to point out constructing the concept descriptions so it's not finding something

488
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:36,280
that's already captured t books but

489
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:40,990
really making the use of concept operators that are available in description logic to come

490
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,710
up with the best fitting description so you can think of the LCS of something

491
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,020
like it captures

492
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,640
what the concepts basically agree on

493
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,190
so expect the commonality

494
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,880
if we want to apply the LCS what do we have to take a look

495
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,670
at all but what kind of constraints to we have so again

496
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,440
the least common subsumer is implemented only four unfold which he works so we can

497
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,610
have this case where only have the name on the left-hand side and complex cont

498
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:13,050
the description on the right hand side which is then a fix

499
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,120
and here the the most explosive description logic for which

500
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:24,270
it is available as a eli and so it its extends on

501
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:28,210
the description logic we have seen so far in my demo by number restrictions so

502
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,070
that we can say that things like

503
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,280
at least

504
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,490
something has at least three

505
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,280
or has at most

506
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:40,300
five kind of role fillers

507
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,050
so this is what is

508
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,010
in favour of plcs

509
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,520
if it

510
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,040
turn back to

511
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,610
to the demo

512
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,810
we want to do this this step now

513
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:02,540
for the concerts we have obtained in the first step forward

514
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:20,200
and here we can

515
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,850
start from these concepts that we have

516
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,880
find out in the first step so this is what the bottom-up approach would just

517
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,020
and you saw if concept of feeling concept and i didn't even carla concept and

518
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:36,180
then we have this beautiful buttons here which linked to two sonic

519
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,490
we click

520
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,530
these concepts in the pattern

521
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,960
and so

522
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:52,160
authorities was one

523
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,590
so we don't want to we're not interested in in the

524
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,150
this comes from of all of them so i mean find out that person's but

525
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,250
this is of course correct is of course not very interesting it is much more

526
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,190
interesting of course to see

527
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,770
but these

528
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,650
two concepts down to because they were

529
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,510
much more like if you recall these words to concepts speaking about students which had

530
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,700
an advisor which were some kind of professor

531
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,380
so if we take a look of what we can find out what kind of

532
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,270
communities you can find out about these two concepts hard to get something slightly more

533
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:34,060
interesting was to find out that these are questions but you see also

534
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:38,230
that they have an adviser which is a person

535
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,610
also on the faculty appears slightly redundant

536
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,330
and these these persons are professors

537
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,420
while working for certain organisations

538
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,750
and i see also way

539
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,900
or you get an idea why

540
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,980
line is only squared

541
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,530
we can go

542
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,270
almost end of story

543
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,590
i'm going to rewrite it a little the only french in his book rewrites it

544
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,190
again in different ways

545
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,460
the last to work with QC put cues in there

546
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,830
i'm going to devote divide upstairs and downstairs by omega squid

547
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,740
and when i do that i get a zero

548
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,250
get the gummi here

549
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,310
i get two and here

550
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,820
and then

551
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,750
i get omega zero squared

552
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,250
divided by omega

553
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,460
mine omega

554
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,040
please come up with

555
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,630
that's what i get

556
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,660
that's not the only way you can write it

557
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,340
that's one way you can write me check that

558
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,030
i have

559
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,460
i have zero created i have got

560
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,620
two and here

561
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:04,230
and we have this

562
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,790
so the time has come now

563
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,040
to try to see through this equation

564
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,650
remember last lecture we spend the whole lecture not to look at this time equation

565
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,630
but to see through it

566
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:22,490
and we were able to see through it the all its idiosyncrasies

567
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,490
let's look

568
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:27,850
you use increases of this average power over one

569
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:32,950
cycle or multiple cycles

570
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,970
that first

571
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:43,040
they got my infinitely large don't look even at the equation

572
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,320
infinitely large

573
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:49,380
that means is an infinite amount of friction

574
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,620
the system never gets going

575
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,160
there's no way to ever move

576
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,460
so clearly

577
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,070
the average power

578
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,020
must go to zero

579
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,160
and indeed

580
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,420
you see that the government is downstairs

581
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,490
gamma goes to infinity

582
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,930
power is zero

583
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:14,100
that's the make them as infinitely large if the mass is infinitely large an infinite

584
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,390
high inertia

585
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,620
nothing will ever get going no force will ever get the mass going

586
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,280
that means

587
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,170
the expected the power

588
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,450
goes to zero

589
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,580
and indeed you see here is and goes to infinity

590
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,390
the power goes to zero

591
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,410
let's say

592
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,340
the force

593
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,980
goes to zero were not even driving it well if we're not even driving it

594
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,650
i hope you will agree with me you don't have to put in any work

595
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,250
right nothing gets going so clearly you expect

596
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,050
that power will go

597
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,200
two zero and indeed it have zero goes to zero

598
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,920
that the power is zero

599
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,540
suppose you make or break

600
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,180
so that means

601
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:03,160
there will never be any velocity you never pick up any velocity

602
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,020
six infinitely long omega

603
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,420
so clearly

604
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,160
if nothing ever moves

605
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,320
the power

606
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,690
look if omega make zero

607
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,000
this is zero

608
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,980
this one goes to infinity

609
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,670
and therefore the power goes to zero

610
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,260
so you need no equations for that

611
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,340
just common sense

612
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:30,190
two immediately conclude that this has to be

613
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,820
the case

614
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,540
suppose you go

615
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,760
to infinity was omega

616
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
very very fast

617
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,850
if you go infinitely fast

618
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:45,010
because of the inertia of the system it can never react

619
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,970
i can never get going so i will predict

620
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,470
then the power

621
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,510
must go

622
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,180
and if you put omega infinity

623
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,320
this goes to zero is goes to infinity and so it all goes to zero

624
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,990
so all this is complete common sense

625
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,680
all of these you could have predicted without that equation but isn't it nice

626
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,880
that the equation supports my intuition

627
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,990
now comes the question if omega

628
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,870
goes to omega zero

629
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,400
that's the reason why i wrote it in this way

630
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:23,490
notice when omega goes to zero

631
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,990
when omega goes omega zero this one goes to zero

632
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,260
and therefore

633
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,530
now i begin today

634
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,010
this is by the way

635
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:40,450
regular practice on this is as close as i get to bulleted powerpoint it's all

636
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,480
i ought to have got through

637
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,560
those topics by the end of the lecture if i don't not to worry i'll

638
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:53,160
pick up where the dotted line emerges in the subsequent lectures

639
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,270
but in any case i thought i'd begin today by a

640
00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:00,950
making a few remarks about the title of our courts

641
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,490
because it has some big words and theory

642
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:09,120
and literature but also introduction i think it's worth saying word two

643
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,790
about the word introduction

644
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:11,890
as well

645
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,920
no theory

646
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:19,530
has a very complicated etymological history that i won't trouble you with the trouble with

647
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:24,120
the etymology of theory in the way in which the word has been used traditionally

648
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:31,420
is that sometimes it actually means practice and then another historical period it means something

649
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:38,560
very different from practice something typically from which practice is derived well that's the sense

650
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,480
of theory that i i like to work with on and i would over by

651
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,960
saying that after all there is a difference in which and we shouldn't too quickly

652
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,660
at least confuse the terms there is no difference between theory and methodology yes it's

653
00:42:55,330 --> 00:43:01,500
fair enough to say that methodology is applied theory on but there's great danger in

654
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:09,730
supposing that every aspect of theory has an immediate applications theory is very often a

655
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:17,870
purely speculative undertaking it's an hypothesis about something the exact nature of which one need

656
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,940
necessarily have in view

657
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:26,600
it's the supposition that whatever the object theory might be it must owing to whatever

658
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,440
intellectual constraints one can imagine be of such form

659
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,410
and at this level of abstraction

660
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:38,830
plainly there isn't all that much incentive to apply

661
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,390
thinking of that time but on the other hand undoubtedly

662
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,460
theory does exist for the most part to be applied

663
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:52,230
very frequently courses of this kind of have a text

664
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,300
a list of this

665
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,600
the riemannian error

666
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,370
a short story

667
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,770
and then once in a while they a

668
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:06,310
disquisition of lecture will parse the text will be produced and whatever theory has recently

669
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,950
been talked about will be

670
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,790
applied to the text so that you get a postcolonial reading of the riemannian married

671
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,530
something by the way which is absolutely fascinating and important to do

672
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,360
and so on through the courts now i suppose it's my

673
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:30,340
the reluctance to get into the intricacies of questions having to do with applied theory

674
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,390
that makes me

675
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,390
prefer to keep it simple

676
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,300
our text

677
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,010
it is a story for toddlers

678
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,660
called tony the tow truck

679
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:45,160
i've decided not to pass today because after all i want to get into the

680
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,160
right hands you can read it unless you take the course

681
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,880
and so

682
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:54,110
now i know a little bit we don't we don't come back to least for

683
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:56,760
the moment and that you see

684
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,670
that's mercifully short

685
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,370
and as time passes we will do

686
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:05,210
so rather interesting tricks with we will

687
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:08,730
revert as others revert to listen to this too

688
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:13,680
donna the tow truck for the purpose of introducing questions are applied there

689
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:21,580
this may suggest certain condescension both theory and taught literary texts which is not at

690
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:26,910
all intended it's much more question reminding that i reminding you that if you can

691
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:31,280
do that with this you can do it with anything but also

692
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:40,550
reminding you that after all reading reading just anything is a complex and potentially almost

693
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:46,750
unlimited activity that's one of the good things that theory teaches us that i hope

694
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,530
to be able to get across in our in in the in the course of

695
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:54,800
our part of of our varied approaches to

696
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,270
tony the total truck

697
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,530
resembles philosophy

698
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,050
perhaps in this that it

699
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:09,690
asks fundamental questions and also at times builds system that is to say theory has

700
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:16,770
certain ambitions to a total isation of what can be thought of that resembles arrivals

701
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,790
but theory differs from philosophy and this is something that i'm going to be coming

702
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:22,580
back to

703
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:27,690
you are persisting late in the in the second half of this lecture and many

704
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,620
times hereafter

705
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,200
it differs from most philosophy

706
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:37,780
in that it involves a certain and this is by no means self-evident why should

707
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:41,750
this be is one of the questions were going to be asking involves a certain

708
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,930
skepticism there seems to be

709
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,480
i doubt

710
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,750
a variety of doubts

711
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:53,560
about the foundations of what we can think about the basis of our opinions that

712
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:59,290
pervades theory seems somehow or another to characterize its history

713
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,440
now not all theory that we read in this course is skeptical

714
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:07,780
some of the most powerful and profound thought that's been devoted to

715
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:14,960
the subjective theory literature are is positive in its intentions and views but by and

716
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,480
large you will

717
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:22,290
happily or unhappily come to terms with the fact that much of what you're going

718
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:25,730
to be reading this semester is under

719
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:32,420
grid or perhaps i should say undermined by this persisting skepticism

720
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,030
it's crucial as i say that i'm going to be comeback coming back to it

721
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:40,340
but it's just the point i want to make in passing about the nature theory

722
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:44,090
turning to the word literature

723
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:49,120
this is not a theory of relativity theory music theory of government this is a

724
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,950
course in

725
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:56,800
and serious literature shares in common with other kinds of literature other kinds of theory

726
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:03,410
the need for definition that is to say may be the most central infamy infamy

727
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:09,270
possibly the most fascinating question here as it is well what literature

728
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,280
how do we know when we see it

729
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:16,440
how can we define now much of what will be reading takes up the question

730
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,570
stepping in the negative gradient directions

731
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,260
if you toss in a component which is equal to the last step to just

732
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,420
so now that know your step is the combination of the latest gradient and the

733
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,100
previous step

734
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,440
it's cool heavy ball causing this in a sense this is kind of momentum to

735
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:36,170
right it's kind of your tending to move along the same direction that you just

736
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:40,590
moved in but you tweak it a little bit with the latest great OK

737
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,350
now you've got two knobs to turn you get to choose not only alpha but

738
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:47,090
also by the so the question is by turning those two knobs can you get

739
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,220
a faster convergence rate

740
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,720
well it turns out to be easy to analyse two in the way analyses is

741
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,460
you just collapse two successive areas into a single vector

742
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:00,720
so if on this vector wk which is the dimension two n

743
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,560
and i look at what this recurrences in terms of wk well it turns out

744
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,210
it's approximately this

745
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:12,920
from wk wk plus one year approximately operate under because the linear operator b

746
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:14,350
or in matrix b

747
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:17,170
two n by two n matrix it looks like this

748
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:21,900
and there little remainder term which is due to the nonlinearity in f k

749
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:27,330
so what's be look like well b is blocked two by two matrix very simple

750
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:32,870
except that there is the hessian of f appearing here and close to the solution

751
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,170
you know this WK we small

752
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,300
b be very close will be is essentially this

753
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:45,000
our aim is to choose alpha and so that b has nice spectral properties and

754
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,810
you'll know that when you got linear recurrence and you're looking to

755
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:50,580
converge to zero

756
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:53,800
the name of the game is to try and make sure your occurrence matrix b

757
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,540
has the same value strictly less than one and is much less than one as

758
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,210
you can possibly make them

759
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,890
so we're going to try to choose alpha invaded

760
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,650
to minimize the maximum igon value b

761
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:07,590
so that's the game now

762
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:12,230
you can do a similarity transformation on the to just reduced this passionate the

763
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,330
next to just its diagonal with news that i can values on the diagonal

764
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,710
and when you look at that you can sort of now write down what they

765
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:25,350
are there is pretty much just in closed form and and it turns out that

766
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:28,260
you know it's pretty simple a little bit of simple arithmetic

767
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:31,020
to figure out what all from beira and here

768
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,990
you have to model for is that europa will baiters that

769
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:38,090
if you got an ill conditioned problem where kappa is large

770
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:40,230
batteries pretty close to one

771
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:44,370
health is going to be pretty small in general OK and so you only taking

772
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:48,870
a little bit of energy in a negative gradient direction you attending mostly to move

773
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:52,320
in the same direction as the previous step she took

774
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,300
but this is the convergence rate

775
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,760
it looks like the linear convergence rate that we were getting only but this really

776
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,170
important difference

777
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:04,390
now we just got the square root of kappa in the denominator is not cap

778
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,040
and that can be a huge difference OK

779
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,370
in fact if your goal is to take

780
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:13,520
it is to reduce your initial error by a factor epsilon so you want to

781
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,880
figure out out how many steps you need to take

782
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:21,100
to reduce here by epsilon if you've got a rate constant like this

783
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,800
it's going to take you something like kappa over two log epsilon steps

784
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,920
if you go to a concert like this the one we just got

785
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:32,860
it's going to take you recap to serve cap is one hundred which is still

786
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:36,190
moderately condition problem not too bad

787
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,310
you need ten times as many steps if you're using one of these concepts

788
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:46,340
the heavy ball method can be remarkable improvement just the naive gradient descent

789
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,540
the conjugate gradient is probably something you love you've heard of in

790
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,590
you if you take in any kind of

791
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,580
linear algebra course or optimisation course

792
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:59,640
the idea consecrated great is very very similar to heavy ball in fact you know

793
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:00,800
the really

794
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:05,440
almost identical in the sense the motivated maybe slightly differently but you can see in

795
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,410
conjugate gradient step to take is in the direction pk NP again it's just a

796
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:13,680
combination of the latest gradient and the previous step

797
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:18,960
OK and really can't agree there just different methods of choosing how to balance of

798
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,850
these two components and another set motivated a little bit differently in fact we can

799
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,150
identify with the heavy ball method by

800
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,490
noting the relationship between the gamma

801
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:33,400
in the country gradient and the baiter inevitable and we'll get you know pretty much

802
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,020
the same thing

803
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:41,450
now there are many variants of CG CG of course that originally came up as

804
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:47,630
a way to solve the linear equations with symmetric positive definite coefficient matrices

805
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:53,020
but that's the same as minimizing the quadratic convex objective and you can generalize to

806
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,050
the two main methods for minimizing general

807
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:57,970
large amount

808
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:01,410
so for those of you who used matlab if you go back slash

809
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:05,490
that's all i was doing it doing the squares but

810
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,910
it's not doing this

811
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:07,930
now you want to

812
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:12,010
it's possible for the matrix but let's look at this formula in trying to understand

813
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:17,050
a little bit even though numerically unstable to give some intuition for this one say

814
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,310
it says the location which relates y

815
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,640
that's the parameters theta here

816
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:28,060
it is the correlation between x and y

817
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:34,160
but you don't want to be confused by the correlations between the inputs themselves

818
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,990
so we have divided by

819
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:39,010
the cross correlation matrix of the input

820
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:44,780
this is exactly like the winner filter in which you have the correlation between signal

821
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:48,350
and noise is the power in the signal divided by

822
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,910
power in the noise

823
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:54,010
this is exactly the same idea

824
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,760
as we have

825
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:59,640
but of course the discrete setting here and if you want to make this formula

826
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,780
comes from

827
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,240
and you don't like to think in sort of

828
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,310
you know a continuous

829
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:09,510
derivatives and scalar variables

830
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:13,010
we can do this for the innovation and the switch to this is

831
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,580
as long as

832
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,970
we can do a whole generation using matrix algebra

833
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,330
you can write the

834
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:26,120
as just a sum over data points

835
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,990
of y n minus

836
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:32,240
it is but it's

837
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,240
and we know that the norse

838
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,280
is just

839
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,550
the product of a vector with itself

840
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,200
so this is x

841
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,080
the same thing

842
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,450
because this is an inner product we can write it as the trace of the

843
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:56,830
so this is the trace here

844
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:01,160
why big matrix y which is all of the

845
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,310
data stacked on top of of each other

846
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,530
this is the same thing

847
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:20,260
we can expand this matrix

848
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,180
one of the terms

849
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:26,350
that appearance so the term which is why transpose y

850
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:30,370
there's a term which is twice

851
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:33,580
they data transpose

852
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,470
well i guess

853
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,390
here the

854
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,080
the terms

855
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,390
which is

856
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,470
see here

857
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:55,200
so then the charge

858
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,790
which is

859
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:03,740
extract from

860
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,830
they transpose

861
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:14,080
and i now because traces only operation you can take the derivative inside the trace

862
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,050
and take the derivative of each of these terms with respect to

863
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:22,280
to date data and so when you take the derivative this term with respect to

864
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,120
data you get two

865
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,510
one here when you take the derivative

866
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:30,990
this term with respect to remember that this is the trace

867
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:35,370
and so we can always permute the cyclic products of the trace as much as

868
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:36,220
we want

869
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,790
in some particular this term here

870
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:41,240
is equal to trace

871
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:47,220
then transpose x x transpose and then we can probably one more time

872
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:53,140
the basis for the data experience of data and now we take the derivative of

873
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,080
that's the quadratic form

874
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,160
and so we get

875
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,100
and now we set this zero install repair we get the

876
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:08,160
the discrete ricci flow can be done in matrix algebra if you prefer this style

877
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,530
of their

878
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,430
a lot of people think that the style derivation is much more confusing than the

879
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:18,410
continuous about regime but it's much faster when you have lots of matrices and vectors

880
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:27,510
i i one

881
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,910
OK so

882
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:31,950
they can i'm having a disagreement about his life

883
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:35,910
OK trying

884
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:37,560
you can try

885
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,390
do some independent component analysis in your mind

886
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:48,010
remove the picture and just reveal underneath the equations you want to tell you a

887
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:53,830
little bit about the idea of sufficient statistics alex is given a research level talk

888
00:57:53,850 --> 00:58:00,030
on this time next week on the relationship between some kernel models and sufficient statistic

889
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:04,760
and feature space but just to cover the basic idea here

890
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:09,470
a sufficient statistic is a possibly vector valued functions

891
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,580
the set of random variables

892
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:16,260
and it has the the property that if the sufficient statistic of one data set

893
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,930
is equal to the sufficient statistic of another dataset

894
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:23,930
then the likelihood function of one dataset

895
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:27,350
is equal to the likelihood function of another

896
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:33,850
and in a formal way of thinking about the sufficient statistic is sufficient statistic is

897
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:36,030
a property of the model

898
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:40,950
ninety days property of model and it tells you what you need to know about

899
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,220
a dataset

900
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,760
in order to do maximum likelihood estimation under that model

901
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,830
let's go back to some of the examples here and you can begin to understand

902
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:54,280
what a sufficient statistic is

903
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,870
so for example let's go back to to the coin tosses

904
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:02,390
by calling i flipped a thousand times and written on this piece of paper

905
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:04,660
the sequence has himself

906
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,490
also which represent exactly the thousand points

907
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:11,850
and what do maximum likelihood estimation the bias of the point but

908
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:15,680
i mean nasty and i refuse to show you the diff

909
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:19,870
one summary of the data you need to ask me for in order to be

910
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:23,470
able do maximum likelihood

911
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:27,060
exactly just the number of nodes and the number of

912
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,930
once know the number of nodes and the number of and or the number of

913
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,870
cells in the total number of flips

914
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,260
you can the original data was

915
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,080
and therefore the number

916
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,680
and the number of tails is a sufficient statistic

917
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,560
for maximum likelihood estimation in the

918
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,760
bernoulli model

919
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:49,870
so that's says what property of the dataset that i'm hiding from you do need

920
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,550
to know before you can do maximum likelihood estimation

921
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,470
same thing in the multinomial

922
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:59,180
you don't need to know the whole sequence of coin dice rolls you just need

923
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:04,700
to know the number of times that i came out to three became that's sufficient

924
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,760
they were going to continue

925
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,970
wissen playing with liquid

926
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:14,250
i have an object that floats

927
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:17,810
a simple cylinder

928
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,220
floating some liquid

929
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,240
there is a year the mass

930
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,420
of the cylinder

931
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,530
it is and

932
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:28,550
the density of the cylinder is rho

933
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,600
and in length

934
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:30,850
is al

935
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:33,240
the surface area is a

936
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:34,710
so this

937
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:38,780
let the liquid line

938
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:45,130
and the flow it has a density rho fluid

939
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:48,430
i call this level y one

940
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,810
his level y two

941
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,960
this separation is a child

942
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,810
and right on top you know is the atmospheric pressure p two

943
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:59,020
which is the same

944
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,090
as it is here

945
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,600
on the liquid

946
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:04,350
and here we have

947
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,670
in the liquid

948
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,650
put is object

949
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,010
two float

950
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:17,850
we need equilibrium between on the one hand

951
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,230
the force mg

952
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,530
there is a force

953
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:30,260
up here we tackle one

954
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,040
and there is a force down here

955
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:34,810
tackle have two

956
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,760
barometric pressure

957
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:41,590
fort is always perpendicular to the surface couldn't be any tangential component because dr starts

958
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:42,730
to flow

959
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,680
and its static

960
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:46,230
and here we have f one

961
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,260
which contains the

962
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:50,890
i just added pressure

963
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,230
so p one

964
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:56,700
minus two as the last time from moscow

965
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:01,310
of the fluid

966
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,870
and y two minus y one

967
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,840
which is a ge

968
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,570
that's the difference between

969
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:11,970
the pressure p one and p two

970
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,470
for this to be in equilibrium

971
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,690
f one

972
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:21,050
miners after minus

973
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,500
you have to be zero

974
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:24,730
and this

975
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,970
we call

976
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:28,570
the buoyant force

977
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:31,670
i'm going to spell in a very strange way

978
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,800
the you all why

979
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,200
a and t

980
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,040
always have to think about

981
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,950
it's the buoyant force everyone

982
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:42,420
because every time he one

983
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,890
and it and f two

984
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:47,730
is the area

985
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,260
and two

986
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:53,320
so it is the area times one minus two

987
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:54,230
and that

988
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:56,540
real fluids

989
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:57,950
i'm doing

990
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:00,360
and h

991
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,700
and when you look at this

992
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,790
this is exactly the weight

993
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:07,850
of the displaced fluid

994
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:12,380
area times age is the volume of the fluid

995
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:13,820
which displaced by this

996
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,260
and you multiply by density that gives it

997
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,450
multiplied by g weight

998
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:25,140
so this is the weight

999
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:30,440
of the displaced fluid

1000
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:34,290
and this is a very special case

1001
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,600
of a

1002
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:39,230
general principle which is called archimedes principle

1003
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:42,230
archimedes principle this follows the buoyant force

1004
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,980
on an emerging body

1005
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,390
has the same magnitude as the weights

1006
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:51,640
of the fluid which is displaced by the body

1007
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:53,260
according to legend

1008
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,130
i q made is about this while he was

1009
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:57,970
taking it back

1010
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,830
and i have a picture of that year

1011
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:00,730
i don't know

1012
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,410
from when that dates

1013
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,630
what you see in there in the past

1014
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:06,100
which you also see

1015
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,220
are there two crowns

1016
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:11,200
there's a reason why does crowns are there

1017
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,790
i recommend lifting the thirty

1018
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:15,170
century BC

1019
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:17,720
archimedes had been given the task

1020
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,110
to determine

1021
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:23,060
whether a crown that was made for king here on the second

1022
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:27,050
was pure gold

1023
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,820
the problem for him was to determine the density

1024
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:34,030
well what's difficult what's fundamentally difficult here

1025
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,110
is that

1026
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:41,040
the obvious way find the argmax would involve enumerating all possible y

1027
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:44,520
and why is it comes from the discrete set so

1028
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,860
in principle i could enumerate all possible y

1029
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:52,440
but the number of different y is exponential so it's going to be

1030
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:56,500
in practice intractable to enumerate all possible y

1031
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:03,010
this is one dollar needs to solve the problem is

1032
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:05,830
to evaluate

1033
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:11,010
the probability of y

1034
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,490
i must

1035
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,950
we need to compute

1036
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:20,610
xe x on w

1037
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:25,890
the sum of all life crime

1038
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:29,690
of ax

1039
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:32,080
some of the j

1040
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,650
wj fj

1041
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,350
so noticed that

1042
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:45,020
so this is the normalisation constant makes probably add up to one

1043
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,850
and if i want to find out what has the highest probability

1044
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:52,050
i don't actually need to evaluate this nomination called and i can just ignore it

1045
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:53,340
but if i want to

1046
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:54,520
find out

1047
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:56,870
if i want to find out the true probability

1048
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:01,540
then i do need to evaluate the normalisation constant

1049
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:09,450
the intuitive difficulty in evaluating the normalisation constant is the same involves enumerating explicitly overall

1050
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,680
more so i'm going to

1051
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:16,830
provide algorithms for

1052
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:22,780
solving these two problems and then i'm going to provide training our conditional random fields

1053
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:29,250
which is stochastic gradient descent and that's going to be those those are the three

1054
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:32,260
basic algorithms for conditional random fields

1055
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,350
the the algorithm for these two problems it's

1056
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:45,160
well they don't there's no somehow invalid just regression with you don't have similar problems

1057
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:49,350
but the algorithm for training is similar our the four

1058
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:51,310
logistic regression because

1059
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:55,500
it's some also stochastic gradient method

1060
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:06,670
let's come back in one

1061
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,850
five thirty

1062
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:14,690
more and will be refreshed i'll be refreshed to give these algorithms

1063
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:17,380
get started on the on line

1064
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:25,600
OK much

1065
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:26,820
we want to do

1066
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:31,750
why is argmax

1067
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,830
over y

1068
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,340
over j

1069
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,440
x y so

1070
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,630
this is

1071
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:55,130
we want to do we want to do this in polynomial time but actually going

1072
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:58,220
to be i think quadratic in the length of y

1073
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:04,340
linear in the length of wire quadratic in something else

1074
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,720
is not going to expand the definition of the high level feature function

1075
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:17,910
some of the j

1076
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,710
and then some of my

1077
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,040
little fj

1078
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:30,690
why i minus one y i

1079
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,950
x far i noticed

1080
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:41,560
just to note his confused so here j is ranging over the feature functions

1081
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:42,630
and then i

1082
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:46,540
his ranging over the length of x and y so this is for a single

1083
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:52,150
test example x i is not ranging over multiple training examples going over the length

1084
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:53,630
of one example

1085
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,240
let me

1086
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:03,450
OK so

1087
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:04,970
what i'm going to do

1088
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:08,460
must just

1089
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,140
the order of these summations

1090
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:19,440
o alive are

1091
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,000
some of

1092
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,050
and then

1093
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,340
what i have is

1094
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:33,700
some of the j

1095
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:40,770
little fj why i minus one y expx y

1096
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:44,590
and then i'm going to call this

1097
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:47,690
meiji function

1098
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,380
i'm going to call this

1099
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,140
g i

1100
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,360
why i minus one

1101
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:56,890
why i

1102
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,500
there are in

1103
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:05,070
going from here to here

1104
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:10,680
this function

1105
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:14,460
as a function of y i minus one y i

1106
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:20,110
and so i still have those arguments wireless won why i but this argument i

1107
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:26,050
am just making it into the subscripts have different g function for each i and

1108
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:28,840
then x and w

1109
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:35,210
object then you would get documents from soap standard specification

1110
01:10:35,210 --> 01:10:41,270
and i think that that's the web services would be seen

1111
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:47,440
this is again about the so

1112
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:52,610
well similarly let's see if you were typing i think which very close to a

1113
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,110
solve this problem

1114
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:06,650
doesn't work

1115
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:13,130
i would need to society

1116
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:16,900
and this is just a an pair

1117
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:22,520
it didn't didn't do any of the need to close the window and

1118
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:26,550
run it again i think

1119
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,900
let's a

1120
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:40,340
much work

1121
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:44,170
if for instance would mean either of the or

1122
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:48,900
they perform at

1123
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:55,230
a for which we use in europe

1124
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:58,710
and let's see paper

1125
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:02,770
paper would be here

1126
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:06,550
remove it here then you get everything about this

1127
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:12,550
this is a nice example where we put together a little bit of this text

1128
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:19,540
mining techniques and some from ten to some back components

1129
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,630
let's continue its

1130
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:30,170
this is textarc is one

1131
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:38,020
interesting textures asia text visualisation system as well

1132
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:43,960
there we can analyse entities within a larger pieces of text so i want go

1133
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,500
here to the data can

1134
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:51,670
go to this that are text text are about common probably so this is the

1135
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:58,040
position of hamlet and here we can see relationships between hamlet and other entities which

1136
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,900
appear in the book and it

1137
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:02,000
nice little

1138
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:07,270
java applets which actually can be quite useful for some

1139
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,230
four high-level browsing of text

1140
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,820
this this one is also quite

1141
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,460
interesting even used by many

1142
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:25,780
news portals so this is one way how to visualize news stories and one the

1143
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:30,730
idea here is just if the topic is more important before on the previous positions

1144
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:34,460
we saw in the topic is more important than we

1145
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:39,960
to make a larger mountain the geographical map here we just right the topic or

1146
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:46,110
titling bigger font nothing and the topics are also categorized by the color based on

1147
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:47,880
the from which to the

1148
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,340
area news area they

1149
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:54,570
they are and the whole thing can actually you can see

1150
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:55,730
what's going on in

1151
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:59,960
quite efficient efficient way

1152
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:01,440
this is the

1153
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:02,500
picture from today

1154
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:11,750
and now i show this visualisation of this our system which we call document atlas

1155
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:19,730
which is also free to get it from this the dots plus the ideas site

1156
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:33,750
so here we visualize

1157
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:38,110
well short they must but this

1158
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:42,980
one is

1159
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:50,340
but hard to visualize project so this was actually a demonstration which we may to

1160
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:53,980
our but for european commission

1161
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:59,710
agency which was financing our project so this is a shelf

1162
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:05,270
two years of work of two hundred fifty scientists but you cannot see much but

1163
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:07,500
let me first show what how

1164
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:11,690
this can be understood so each cross here is one person and two persons are

1165
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:13,570
close or on the map the

1166
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:22,300
the work they did see what they publish similar style of content

1167
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:25,040
now if we turn on the

1168
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:30,770
document names but we will get all the people

1169
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:36,400
which are in the project now if it decreases

1170
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,800
so here we get just the most intensive once

1171
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:45,040
and we see the structure market this is interesting especially if you know the people

1172
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:50,940
that you would recognise that this or relatively if it's what you can turn off

1173
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:58,420
and we can ask question about one particular part of the of this picture about

1174
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,840
these are kind of content work which

1175
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,460
came directly from the

1176
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:09,000
documents which are visualized here here we would recognise that this is about project is

1177
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:14,340
actually a network of excellence which works in different fields of machine learning can this

1178
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,340
area here with corresponds to

1179
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:21,340
text mining can natural language processing this would be multimedia and this is small kernel

1180
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,020
methods and theory

1181
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:28,730
and so if we don't

1182
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:36,320
on this magnifying glass we can zoom in certain parts let's say here

1183
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:38,230
here it's me

1184
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,610
we can visualize so

1185
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:44,440
whatever it covered by this

1186
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:50,020
circle somehow is visualized by the most relevant keywords which are

1187
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:52,440
in this in this article

1188
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:57,960
as i said so if if you know the content of documents this can make

1189
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,360
you quite efficient

1190
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:10,070
the show also the second data set which is visualizing new stories through time as

1191
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:17,770
so here visualizing

1192
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:22,210
here we visualize a hundred thousand news from writers

1193
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:28,340
so we took hundred thousand using calculate this

1194
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,340
this this man

1195
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:37,300
on this map and the

1196
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:43,050
calculated the profile of each of the named entities which appear in these articles and

1197
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:46,230
put his name entity on the place which feeds

1198
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:50,780
which is the on the on the place where it is the best

1199
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,920
and this is this

1200
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,650
happens through time so here is the date

1201
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:58,710
so that if we we move this

1202
01:17:58,730 --> 01:17:59,920
through time the

1203
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:05,790
we learn this model using the variational approaches just described and compare we also used

1204
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:09,940
the equivalent variation approach just using the phrase states

1205
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:12,480
and we use the

1206
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:17,170
j rank algorithm the second half the which is a kernel method for jointly learning

1207
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:19,500
the content and the collaborative data

1208
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:22,700
to then ordinal classification to this

1209
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:27,930
and we also used a set of naive bayes classifier one classifier reaches

1210
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:30,550
train a classifier using the content data

1211
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,590
and order predict the

1212
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:42,360
so in first experiment we randomly held out test data and

1213
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:43,680
created the

1214
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:47,810
held out data and calculate the pharmacy on this how the data

1215
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:51,090
we found some model outperforms the other three models

1216
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,990
and i find this kind of what's the problem that motivates this look this problem

1217
01:18:58,990 --> 01:19:00,310
in the first place

1218
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,420
if you call

1219
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,350
one thing is that

1220
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:07,980
mean it's interesting combining content and collaborative data

1221
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:12,240
was the fact that after filtering alone generally works poorly when we've got a new

1222
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,170
movie or new items

1223
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:16,990
so we wanted to have a way of finding out well

1224
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,360
how to method for on in the movie

1225
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:23,350
so to do this we took the movielens data

1226
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:27,880
simulate the effects of the new movie just really being released hardly has any ratings

1227
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:33,490
so out for dataset we chose two hundred is random out of the set of

1228
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:35,240
all movies that had

1229
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,080
two hundred ratings

1230
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:42,640
and we removed almost all the ratings for these movies leaving behind three norton ten

1231
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:46,750
these two hundred movies

1232
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:50,820
this was to community that only a handful of people who reviewed

1233
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:55,820
we then predicted the remaining held out data using the former as before

1234
01:19:55,910 --> 01:20:01,200
it was found be more significant improvement in the treatment factorisation method where we were

1235
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,400
including the content and the

1236
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:06,890
richard data rather than just covered data

1237
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:14,530
and compared with the other two methods can be for combining content interpret data

1238
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,170
this is very nice

1239
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,080
we made a big assumption

1240
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:23,580
which is this how data is nice and friendly gaussians

1241
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:26,860
which always nice and convenient but it's not always appropriate

1242
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:31,360
probably a reasonable model for the ratings villains

1243
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:35,120
but there are many situations which less appropriate so for example

1244
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,350
if you have

1245
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:41,270
rather than ratings have some sort of implicit preference given by the number of times

1246
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,230
a user listening to

1247
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:47,200
online radio is listened to certain artist certain song

1248
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:52,540
and i think that's more likely to be possible distributed then distributed similarly if you

1249
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:56,910
don't have ratings eighteen just have information about whether you support or not

1250
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,290
so nice

1251
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,220
if you knew the distribution for cricket

1252
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:10,230
so stop with the bayesian exponential family PCA model which was presented by muhammad earlier

1253
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:11,850
in the main conference

1254
01:21:11,890 --> 01:21:12,940
to allow

1255
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,420
inference in the general exponentially for the general exponential family case

1256
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,770
learning most places

1257
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:23,000
so basically exponential family PCA

1258
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:23,650
is is

1259
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:29,240
it's PCA method where the

1260
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:34,260
matrix are is that since the natural parameters of the exponential family was chosen to

1261
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:36,230
use to represent data

1262
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,070
so this is shown

1263
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,250
they are unlikely

1264
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:47,150
matrix has shown but imagine this all

1265
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,450
and that is if you will

1266
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:54,380
so here we have the on matrix is

1267
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:58,920
drawn from the exponential family

1268
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:03,250
parameterized by a linear combination of vectors b

1269
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:05,980
and that is a where

1270
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:11,100
he is drawn from the family conjugate to the exponential family and a is the

1271
01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:13,400
scale set of

1272
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:18,090
scaling factors which are drawn from a gaussian distribution and

1273
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:23,790
on counting distribution we put a calcium prior on the mean and they inverse gamma

1274
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:27,240
prior prior on the variance

1275
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,360
this is based on exponential family PCA

1276
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:35,260
we can extend this to multiple HC's

1277
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:37,290
by holding the

1278
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:40,360
well we can extend this locomotive season in one of two ways

1279
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:43,220
either in the ways i've described here where we have

1280
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:49,350
two mixes of partially separating data are fully observed content data being the same exponential

1281
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:52,610
family where we hold the conjugate

1282
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:54,390
OK last time

1283
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,230
well it's on just the where

1284
01:22:58,610 --> 01:23:01,330
what you can prove the classical

1285
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:07,340
and again you couldn't prove otherwise and the negation free formula

1286
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,250
and that

1287
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:11,930
that's the real one not it

1288
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:20,110
do the truth lies etc etc etc there

1289
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:26,060
i was going to do the proof they while we're waiting for people come in

1290
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,030
most of you back areas

1291
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:29,560
i'm not

1292
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:32,490
there's the people left out there

1293
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,100
i don't come

1294
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,910
we don't need

1295
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:40,370
you or on the last day

1296
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:41,890
i think people

1297
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:48,880
it must be flagging and understand that after two weeks of this logic we can

1298
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:56,970
i have a sort of an energy drink and not taking it personal insults

1299
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:59,030
absolute crap

1300
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:00,640
maybe i should not

1301
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:05,390
in europe

1302
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:09,390
is move on to

1303
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:10,800
a different style

1304
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:15,060
action system i'm well

1305
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,780
this is the styles are really

1306
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:20,360
about by restall

1307
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,720
in his name got all the nodes on the right

1308
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:31,690
things and everything email them to you or your email cells in fact i

1309
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:36,780
a new style sorry not him around so much

1310
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:46,500
a different style of is that's more like a hybrid between in the system

1311
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:49,050
and calculus

1312
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:52,470
it's the sequent style natural deduction system so the

1313
01:24:53,860 --> 01:25:02,640
in sequent calculus against and sequent calculus the one ingenious about it doesn't

1314
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:06,080
he invented both the americans and both

1315
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:09,490
characters and the national to show how to

1316
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:11,860
drive one from the other

1317
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,420
he in in heat

1318
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:19,960
the thing interesting but the sequent calculus

1319
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:21,320
this is the

1320
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,920
don't have introduction elimination rules like you do the natural deduction system

1321
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:35,490
also about adding connectors on the right of the turnstile adding them on the left

1322
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,460
one is that interest

1323
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:38,450
is anybody know

1324
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:40,670
why it's important

1325
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:46,210
get wire sequence started

1326
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:53,300
yeah it backwards against was doing this in nineteen thirty three or whatever

1327
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,450
he was

1328
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:58,770
computers as we do is but that's that's why we are interested in them still

1329
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:01,300
but what sort of analog

1330
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,830
the computation with everything back there

1331
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:10,890
what were they thinking that something that we would as we have more often

1332
01:26:11,230 --> 01:26:15,010
i mean

1333
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:20,610
you what you implement implemented decision procedure

1334
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:21,920
that's why

1335
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,700
we are scientists

1336
01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:28,670
ten methods and this course you you have my tableau methods because for the least

1337
01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:33,610
but is the tableaux for atlas or a lot of the modal logics you looked

1338
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:35,730
give us

1339
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:42,490
right that's kind of is one procedure terminates and in the right way and is

1340
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:44,390
say all branches

1341
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:47,240
yes it's the theorem good

1342
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:49,400
that's a decision procedure

1343
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:54,920
sequence for which is large for classical logic

1344
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,580
the case is not the case

1345
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:00,950
is that what you can do

1346
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:08,290
in start from the new work your way up and slowly

1347
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:09,800
surely removed

1348
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:16,800
you end up with these what are called leaves from the tree that you build

1349
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,490
that's it into function

1350
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,170
centered on that point

1351
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:25,530
so for instance the cosine function if we use a gaussian kernel

1352
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:28,420
OK so the point is mapped into a function that we have to say what

1353
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:33,100
we mean by the dot product between functions and also we have to turn the

1354
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:37,810
space into a linear space with different steps involved in the construction but it's basically

1355
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:40,920
on elementary and i think

1356
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:42,580
we should all understand it because

1357
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:46,520
it's very basic nevertheless it's PD that a lot of people work and support vector

1358
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:49,690
machines and don't know how to construct a feature space

1359
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:54,010
OK so the first step is OK we want to we want to construct a

1360
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:55,750
dot product satisfying this thing

1361
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:59,500
you know to construct dot product we need we first need a vector space of

1362
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:03,190
in our space and then on that space we have to construct something that satisfies

1363
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,640
the conditions that the product has to satisfy

1364
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:10,940
OK so the first thing is turn it into a linear space and it's trivial

1365
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:17,750
in the sense we just turn it into a linear space by adding all functions

1366
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:19,990
of this form

1367
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,690
two our space

1368
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:31,540
so we just say OK certainly these elements have to be all space because that's

1369
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,170
what the mapping produces but

1370
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:38,510
i we'll say that also these functions i now space weather and phi are real

1371
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:43,570
coefficients real numbers and if we just require that these elements of all spaced then

1372
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:49,130
this space is automatically closed under additions because if i take two such functions and

1373
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:53,700
i get another such function just possibly with lot of some so that's so these

1374
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:56,500
are all finite sums

1375
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:58,530
by two such functions

1376
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:02,220
it's called the other one g

1377
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:12,960
a bit different expansion points here if i had two such function i will again

1378
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:17,410
get a function of this type may be with the largest some different coefficients so

1379
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:20,490
this space is closed under addition

1380
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:28,400
the space is also closed under multiplication is with the scale are things like that

1381
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:31,490
you could take all the different properties of vector spaces you'll see that this is

1382
01:29:31,490 --> 01:29:33,800
a vector space or in r space

1383
01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:39,170
OK so the next step is to construct the dot product in that space and

1384
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:43,140
it should be not just any dot product by the dot product that satisfies this

1385
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:46,030
inequality here that this equality

1386
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:51,090
now special case if we substitute this k means

1387
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:53,400
in our case it has to satisfy

1388
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:58,940
the quality

1389
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:02,220
OK so that means

1390
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:04,820
must be equal

1391
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:07,790
the dot product between the kernel itself

1392
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:08,810
in some sense

1393
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:12,310
that's why this kernel is called also called the reproducing kernel

1394
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:16,190
so we have to construct dot product that satisfies

1395
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,790
this condition

1396
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:24,140
and actually this this condition already fixes the whole dot product because if this should

1397
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:24,950
be true

1398
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:25,380
and if the

1399
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:27,490
but i have to be linear

1400
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:31,830
then there's only one way in which we can define the dot product between that

1401
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,200
such functions f and g

1402
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:36,990
so basically dot product

1403
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,550
between f and g

1404
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:51,690
OK so the product has to be equal

1405
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:59,770
this thing here

1406
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:03,970
so if you look at this you will see that special case of this is

1407
01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:09,440
if the only if you forget about the sum you just substitute single kernels and

1408
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,070
so one kernels in the next one comes centered on y

1409
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:16,670
you also don't get this and what your recovery is exactly this equation up here

1410
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:18,640
so this is equal to

1411
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:22,760
this thing here only that of called y instead of x primal

1412
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:27,000
OK so this is our definition of the dot product but we're not allowed to

1413
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,400
call it the dot product because the output products have to satisfy

1414
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:33,590
certain conditions

1415
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,880
in fact

1416
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:39,560
so instance is missing in fact we don't even know yet whether this thing is

1417
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,740
well defined

1418
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:45,890
by this i mean if we have to this these are functions from all space

1419
01:31:45,890 --> 01:31:50,290
but it could be the same function can be expanded differently in terms of different

1420
01:31:50,290 --> 01:31:53,090
kernels different coefficients

1421
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:58,060
but the dot product to be a property really of the function so it should

1422
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:01,840
should be a property of f and g

1423
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:06,480
and it shouldn't depend on what particular expansion we use for f and g

1424
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:11,940
it turns out there's a simple way of seeing that this is well defined and

1425
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:16,820
the way as follows

1426
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:22,670
let's just compute the dot product between f and

1427
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:25,430
a kernel

1428
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:29,520
sitting on

1429
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:37,410
so it directly here

1430
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:42,950
we can see OK the effort is expended in terms of alpha phi k of

1431
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:45,040
x i

1432
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:49,010
so what we can do is we can replace

1433
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,850
we can rewrite this as a

1434
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:53,980
some of the time

1435
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:55,930
some were black and white

1436
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:59,980
and you want to match between colour and black-and-white in different resolutions

1437
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:03,930
now you could probably sit down and actually make a fairly good educated guesses as

1438
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:06,890
what the good compatibility between

1439
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:08,950
features in this case will be

1440
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:12,630
they will biggest nonetheless and you wouldn't really know whether this case is going to

1441
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:14,600
be particularly good

1442
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:17,050
so the point is why not use statistics

1443
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:19,670
to help us with this case

1444
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:23,100
so i said you might have different resolutions

1445
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:25,550
you might actually have different image content

1446
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:30,670
different representation has well so for instance if i have already map of italy but

1447
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:31,910
satellite image

1448
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,890
so they may have on the one hand pixel image

1449
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:37,310
on the other cases symbolic representation

1450
01:33:37,330 --> 01:33:40,600
and i want to match those of it's not quite true

1451
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,400
you also want to have another and that scales

1452
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:46,850
if you

1453
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:48,270
you something that

1454
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:49,480
doesn't work very well

1455
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:52,930
well with low polynomial coefficient have problem

1456
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:57,920
i mean for very large graphs people use very clever heuristics and the idea was

1457
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,090
a little bit well what can we do

1458
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:02,820
actually learning things

1459
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,610
what is

1460
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:18,540
the key point is that this is essentially what will be exploited

1461
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,920
while in general the problem of graph matching is really hard

1462
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:25,760
usually when we want to apply it applied we will applied only in the restricted

1463
01:34:26,850 --> 01:34:29,930
we know what we're going to apply to we know it's an image problem or

1464
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:32,100
we know its chemistry or whatever

1465
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:39,250
therefore using an the shelf general purpose grant matcher to solve the specific problem

1466
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:40,620
should not

1467
01:34:40,630 --> 01:34:45,630
promises very good results but least we should expect that in the restricted domain will

1468
01:34:45,630 --> 01:34:48,200
be doing much better

1469
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:50,790
for instance if

1470
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,560
i think i restrict myself to very very

1471
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:58,640
small subset of grass very special property sometimes the matching problem is trivial

1472
01:34:58,690 --> 01:35:03,020
for instance if i have attributed graphs and they wanted to exact matches

1473
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:04,560
this trivial

1474
01:35:04,570 --> 01:35:08,980
especially if all the attributes are unique saying i can just really match up all

1475
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:12,050
the vertices and edges cheque with images of the same

1476
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:17,410
and that has also subgraphs and other problems are fairly straightforward to solve

1477
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:21,690
you would think well hey this kind of trivial but differently for quite awhile people

1478
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:22,880
didn't use that

1479
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:28,330
so a possible case was one of the biggest earlier people actually did this

1480
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:32,070
i was very surprised when they get to talking camera and city of all people

1481
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:33,420
and and before and

1482
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:38,090
so thought well it's obvious but in hindsight yesterday is like many things are in

1483
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:42,170
but the key point here is

1484
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:44,860
there are lots of interesting applications

1485
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:49,530
where if you just restrict yourself to that small application the matching problem actually becomes

1486
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:56,880
so i'm not talking about a general purpose souls everything type of graph matching algorithm

1487
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:57,630
but one

1488
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:01,010
for specific applications when

1489
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:06,600
the right problem for the specific application will actually be do fairly able to the

1490
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,640
fairly well

1491
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:14,470
for instance you might have graphs where the local neighborhood of a vertex

1492
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:18,770
might tell you enough that overall you can actually match things up

1493
01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:21,500
so this is also where humans are good at so if you give human to

1494
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:24,370
graphs and he looks at individual points in

1495
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:29,090
this is that the neighborhoods are similar he'll probably go and maxim

1496
01:36:29,110 --> 01:36:29,970
in two

1497
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:31,950
close related

1498
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:33,270
matches and then

1499
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:35,680
just work from there

1500
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:39,000
that's when humans are actually pretty good at it

1501
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:44,270
they're not very good if things extremely symmetry can have lots of ambiguities

1502
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:48,000
but the point is actually a lot of problems don't have to is ambiguity so

1503
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,170
we might be able to take advantage of this

1504
01:36:55,110 --> 01:36:58,910
the other thing is that this is quite don't have

1505
01:36:58,990 --> 01:37:03,540
inexact graph matching problem so people actually make the problem harder than it is

1506
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:07,420
because the two graphs are not identical only when you're just asking for well what's

1507
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:09,740
the best match that will correspond to

1508
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:12,120
two graphs

1509
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:20,690
on the market today

1510
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,740
i hope i've explained a little bit

1511
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:28,090
what applications will be

1512
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:30,990
and by the way if you have any questions at any time during my talk

1513
01:37:31,050 --> 01:37:32,690
is just lazy and

1514
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:37,340
and interrupt also during the talk because i mean sixty minutes talk

1515
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:41,870
it's unlikely will also remember what was unclear at the end of the talk

1516
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:44,730
so i ask early

1517
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:51,140
now we need a little bit of notation

1518
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:55,330
so let's have graphs g and g prime

1519
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:57,880
and that's some vertices that footage

1520
01:37:57,930 --> 01:38:00,180
so the prime always indicates

1521
01:38:00,190 --> 01:38:02,270
the other graphs

1522
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,570
and so

1523
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:08,510
i would just also have corresponding matrix by city i j is one

1524
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,560
if there is an edge between i and j

1525
01:38:10,570 --> 01:38:12,480
and is a zero sum

1526
01:38:12,490 --> 01:38:13,930
g is also

1527
01:38:14,050 --> 01:38:16,210
used so anonymously for the

1528
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:17,200
graph edges

1529
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:19,390
the adjacency matrix

1530
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,090
and will be

1531
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:26,930
by the system vertex i and also it's attributes if there are any

1532
01:38:26,980 --> 01:38:28,110
so anyway

1533
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:32,420
let's for the moment just to keep things simple deal with graphs which are the

1534
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:35,890
the same size if they're different sized and we need to extend things a little

1535
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:37,390
bit but it's not a big deal

1536
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:41,630
essentially what we're doing is given two graphs

1537
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:44,290
give us a permutation such that maps

1538
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:47,250
that maps one graph into the other really well

1539
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:51,340
that's at the end of today the problem we're trying to solve

1540
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:52,490
so pi

1541
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,260
a permutation matrix

1542
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:59,600
it's doubly stochastic so there are something the column sums are all ones

1543
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:02,480
and it has only zero and one injuries

1544
01:39:02,530 --> 01:39:04,300
so while i j

1545
01:39:04,330 --> 01:39:07,280
is one if is mapped into track

1546
01:39:07,330 --> 01:39:10,460
and it's zero otherwise

1547
01:39:11,330 --> 01:39:12,410
there is the

1548
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:16,640
probably the most famous matching algorithm which is the linear assignment

1549
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:19,100
and that one works as follows

1550
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:22,880
well i compute some score some compatibility score CIJ

1551
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:26,020
for the match between vertices ui ai and bj

1552
01:39:27,110 --> 01:39:30,310
so that's one graph to ceylon

1553
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:33,770
what do they want to do is

1554
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:38,130
you want to find some permutation point i j

1555
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:41,650
such that this sum is minimized

1556
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:46,040
so CIJ j is zero if there is a very good match it's very large

1557
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,810
and if there is a very bad match

1558
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:52,690
some people use incompatibility scores and then you would simply going maximize this and you

1559
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:53,590
would have

1560
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,850
different CIJ definitions here but

1561
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:58,270
well just

1562
01:39:58,290 --> 01:40:00,280
assume that the IJCAI

1563
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:03,620
if there is a perfect match and it's larger than zero

1564
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:05,690
it's not such a batch

1565
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:09,580
so we just

1566
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:11,170
optimized for this

1567
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:11,990
which is

1568
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:13,260
permutation and

1569
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:17,910
i'll talk a little bit about the moment i could actually go about doing this

1570
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:21,990
so if we had graphs with unique attributes

1571
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:26,100
and you know and teaches these sort of on the order of employees due to

1572
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:29,120
the power of these are the scales exponentially in d

1573
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:31,450
this is a very high dimensional feature vector

1574
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:35,280
but again you can implicitly construct the feature vector and ten

1575
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:37,860
in the province in

1576
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:40,640
so very computationally efficient because just compute

1577
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:45,100
the product between xin zhi at seeing take that one of the party

1578
01:40:45,110 --> 01:40:51,690
and by putting this into kernel implicitly working in an extremely high dimensional space

1579
01:40:57,130 --> 01:41:04,830
well given in just a few specific examples of how to create kernels

1580
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:10,640
so let's see what happens just a few specific examples of kernels and so was

1581
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:14,800
also more generally if face new machine learning problem how do you come up with

1582
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:15,770
the kernel

1583
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:19,730
on the the many ways to think about it but his one intuition that sort

1584
01:41:19,730 --> 01:41:20,670
of useful

1585
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:24,110
so given

1586
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:27,700
so that to actually going to use the feature vector phi of x

1587
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:34,360
and given the attributes you can use the input feature vector five z

1588
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:40,720
and so the kernel is computing the inner product between five x five e

1589
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:45,070
and so on one intuition

1590
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:47,580
this portion intuition this all the right

1591
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:52,650
here isn't isn't isn't isn't the rigours intuition is useful is that if x is

1592
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:54,470
you are very similar

1593
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:58,570
then phi xit phi as you will be pointing in the same direction

1594
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:02,380
and therefore phi and therefore the inner product will be large

1595
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:06,930
all words in contrast if x is you very dissimilar

1596
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:11,810
then five x five xeon only point in different directions and so the product may

1597
01:42:11,810 --> 01:42:12,790
be small

1598
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,040
OK that conditions is not rigorous one the sort of the user want to think

1599
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:19,560
and so on

1600
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:23,760
if a new learning problem the if i give you something some some some random

1601
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:24,920
thing the classifier

1602
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:26,270
you want to decide

1603
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,130
how to come of the kernel

1604
01:42:28,210 --> 01:42:29,490
one way is

1605
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:32,980
to try to come up with a function x

1606
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,540
that is on the same knowledge if you want to any algorithm to think exactly

1607
01:42:40,210 --> 01:42:43,390
and small

1608
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:54,210
in this this is always true but this one one of several intuitions

1609
01:42:54,290 --> 01:42:58,200
so should the cost by some bannu thing trying to you know

1610
01:42:58,230 --> 01:43:03,190
have indigenisation cos phi DNA sequences something just some strange thing you want to classify

1611
01:43:03,330 --> 01:43:06,500
what you could do is try to come the kernel that slot when you want

1612
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:09,200
the album to think he's similar things

1613
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,840
these are just

1614
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:13,210
and so

1615
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:18,910
this runs in the question of let's say i have something i want to classify

1616
01:43:18,910 --> 01:43:21,560
myself as i write down the function

1617
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:28,160
i think it's a good measure of how similar or dissimilar axes you are

1618
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:33,790
for my specific problem so let's a down here because equals e to the miners

1619
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,470
the same right down the function

1620
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:46,210
and i think this is a good measure it is that of

1621
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:48,540
possible is e

1622
01:43:49,550 --> 01:43:55,000
the question then is is is really a valid kernel

1623
01:43:58,790 --> 01:44:00,130
so in other words

1624
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:04,320
you have to understand how to construct kernels about our function like that on the

1625
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:07,680
question is does the really exist some phi

1626
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:16,300
such that a and c is equal to the enterprise

1627
01:44:18,090 --> 01:44:23,830
and that's the question is k valid kernel

1628
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:29,770
and it turns out that there is a there is

1629
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:35,470
just as the does the result that characterizes necessary and sufficient conditions

1630
01:44:35,530 --> 01:44:38,040
when the function you might choose

1631
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:40,530
is valid kernels and

1632
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:45,770
if the intuitionistic ahead and show power that result now

1633
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:52,030
as the suppose k is a valid kernel

1634
01:44:52,170 --> 01:44:56,630
and when i say k is a kernel what i mean is that there doesn't

1635
01:44:56,630 --> 01:44:59,470
indeed exist some function force this holds true

1636
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:08,620
that these are the points x one

1637
01:45:08,640 --> 01:45:13,990
the x m be given

1638
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:20,710
and then we find the matrix k

1639
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:27,790
and i apologize overloading notation now

1640
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,860
OK i'm going to use to denote both the kernel function which is a function

1641
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:37,110
of x and easy as well as the matrix m by n matrix unfortunately

1642
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:40,500
and unfortunately the running of alpha the

1643
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:45,200
they define the kernel matrix on

1644
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,920
this is the

1645
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:52,120
all three

1646
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,930
one reason for the world

1647
01:46:36,770 --> 01:46:37,980
they are

1648
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:44,670
o one

1649
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:04,750
although the very rich

1650
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:08,810
o thing

1651
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:13,210
and children

1652
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:36,160
i i

1653
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:12,020
four o

1654
01:48:15,130 --> 01:48:16,600
and here is

1655
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:17,940
all right

1656
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:35,530
you be

1657
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:38,080
well to first

1658
01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:03,660
or is

1659
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:25,310
a lot of things

1660
01:49:25,330 --> 01:49:35,510
we are know

1661
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,080
thank you

1662
01:50:02,490 --> 01:50:05,120
all of them are

1663
01:50:53,290 --> 01:51:00,310
five years

1664
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:08,120
he said

1665
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:09,850
three years

1666
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:23,210
any other people

1667
01:51:35,530 --> 01:51:40,030
are very low

1668
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:46,260
then when you

1669
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:17,690
the problem

1670
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:29,580
bye bye

1671
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:38,560
right or wrong

1672
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:40,950
she not

1673
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:45,410
is not

1674
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:50,740
all of the

1675
01:53:50,770 --> 01:54:00,170
it is wrong

1676
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:35,210
on one

1677
01:55:33,730 --> 01:55:41,490
four of the

1678
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:46,780
after one

1679
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:20,750
that are

1680
01:56:44,990 --> 01:56:48,110
for role

1681
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:29,880
you it

1682
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:40,890
one more

1683
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:42,860
so one of

1684
01:59:54,350 --> 01:59:56,210
the world
