1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
update of the model

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,050
if there is a change within this block of the data

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,790
you get new behavior and

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,310
no point start to

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,470
the group around here like here in this case

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,570
you will not be

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,270
amplified global update of f every of these

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,960
then in the data matrix

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,480
you will not be able to detect first point is anomaly and that sometimes very

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,270
important to detect

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,320
starting point is

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,270
he the new behavior

13
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,490
or anomalies in this case the this point of view this is an anomaly

14
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,770
but if the point of to group around these points these are not anomalous anymore

15
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,920
because they create value defined behaviour

16
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,340
and that's why it's important not to do this kind of periodic then you basically

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,770
have the model every one hundred attractors because you may miss

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,620
some data because that happened during that block so that's why

19
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,230
people trying to do this kind of incremental

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,240
anomaly detection of items and

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,700
there are two approaches

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,530
the research date incremental LOF incremental CF

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,970
in both of these approaches

24
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,080
updates then basically

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,390
the you update the model after inserting every data record

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,810
you know if you remember there are four steps

27
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,470
you're trying to

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,690
you're trying to compute this lf factor after every new data record is inserted in

29
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,530
into data that is that but by introducing new data record

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,780
the neighborhood

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,120
may change so how to update this

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,530
reachability density and

33
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,230
reachability distance

34
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,310
factors in this election

35
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,300
so whoever the good news is that the number of days that you have to

36
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,560
do for every data record does not depend on the number of data records

37
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,140
so it depends only on the number of dimensions so that's

38
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:03,500
that's a good sign that to do that the complete that it is computationally efficient

39
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,410
and it can be applied or applied in real time problems

40
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,660
we have the same thing for incremental CF

41
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,380
basically the CRF values computed after every new data record is inserted and of course

42
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,960
all of these

43
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,570
done before

44
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,850
basically computing this

45
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,760
a c

46
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,590
distance if remember from the slides of hall harvard

47
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,380
topic on distributed anomaly detection

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,720
sometimes as i mentioned in the beginning date

49
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:49,620
dispersed along several it the geographic locations or solar systems

50
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,030
for example if you can

51
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,320
network intrusion detection problem

52
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,150
you make

53
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,880
university network and university may have different campuses

54
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,560
so if you want to detect anomalies

55
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,260
they wanted to take this global anomalies and you may want to consider the data

56
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,370
from all the campuses

57
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,540
but is this approach is probably too

58
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,380
try to merge all the data together

59
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,530
but that sometimes not feasible because you to extremely huge

60
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,810
the benefit of huge datasets

61
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,720
and sometimes due to privacy citizens for example can credit card fraud

62
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,250
if you want to

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,470
here the situation when two credit card companies in sharing the models but not showing

64
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,570
the data

65
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,680
they may not challet data but they connection to model so

66
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,590
and finally aviation into the safety many aviation company say interested

67
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,660
in learning what can cause the failure but they may not be interested in sharing

68
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,570
the data so that's why

69
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,150
this notion of distributed memory cache is extremely important

70
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,760
i want to

71
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,160
talk about another

72
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,590
application area

73
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,470
where optimization plays an important role

74
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,810
and this is a statistical thing

75
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,640
so i think this one is

76
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,230
this topic is

77
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:14,990
close to

78
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,510
the kinds of things

79
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,190
people in machine learning are interested in

80
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,690
so there's many things one can talk about but i want about something simple regression

81
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,150
i wanna compared least squares regression

82
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,010
to least absolute deviation

83
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,880
and show you how least absolute deviation regression can be solved by linear programming

84
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,190
in the end this might actually get deferred until monday

85
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,000
i wanted

86
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:57,270
o regression analysis the parametric self to simplex methods the number of iterations as a function of

87
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,470
the problem size

88
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,010
for the for the album i just showed you

89
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,400
motivate all this stuff and i hope it's not too elementary

90
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,740
but i thought i would give a little

91
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,680
introduction to means and medians and how they are related to regression in general

92
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,160
so i wrote my book

93
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,600
seventeen years ago

94
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,350
so i took some data

95
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,880
i was able to find

96
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:26,730
and the

97
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,770
internal revenue service's website

98
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,430
in the united states

99
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,440
well adjusted gross incomes and individual tax returns

100
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,160
this was several million

101
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,600
data points i forget exactly how big and was

102
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,380
but those budget data points

103
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,670
and each for each individual

104
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,540
it was

105
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,050
given therein

106
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,980
adjusted gross income is the income minus

107
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,030
various deductions are allowed

108
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,170
so there's just five people

109
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,040
the actual data that i got from them is summarized here this is that the government didn't get all

110
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,280
several million

111
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
returns i just got this little table

112
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,740
and in this table that tells you how many right

113
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,080
this is the number of returns

114
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,440
and this is the adjusted gross income so the total

115
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,630
adjusted gross income is this and this is and thousands of dollars it yes and thousands of dollars

116
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,890
so let's see that's five thousand five million five million four trillion dollars

117
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,190
divided by

118
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,140
one hundred eighteen million

119
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,430
returns will give you the average

120
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,990
in the united states

121
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,500
but the table and i found interesting was that they broke broken down into categories

122
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,670
and told us how many people

123
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,070
in these different company returns in the different categories and the total energy to those

124
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,920
the categories

125
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,790
end so you can use this to find out what the median income is and

126
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,570
i think i have it on the next slide with the median of course is

127
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:05,070
the middle person and that's a little bit this we just are counting these appear

128
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,010
thousand here

129
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,570
well we get tired eighteen million so i get halfway

130
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,330
so this is about a million that's about fifteen and have that the

131
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,310
fifteen twenty eight

132
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,390
forty one

133
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,670
three so somewhere around here is the halfway point are one hundred eighty million so we

134
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,210
average adjusted gross income that seventeen years ago

135
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,990
i think with some more between twenty and twenty five thousand dollars

136
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,250
here the actual number will

137
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,080
so i don't know i can deduce from a table the exact

138
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,570
the median but it's somewhere in the middle ring in the middle and i mean

139
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,670
no one billion in this twenty twenty five thousand range and so i just took

140
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:49,990
the middle

141
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,070
a this

142
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,130
and got the

143
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,360
twenty two thousand five hundred sixty

144
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,270
the median is my estimate the median whereas the mean if i add up all

145
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,120
it's the

146
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,850
three lines in the middle

147
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,500
i think you know

148
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,170
this to me

149
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,540
let's look at the second line there this

150
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,850
a zero

151
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,080
that's the

152
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,620
precondition of the first action

153
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,140
and then there are people who effects of actions

154
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,250
this is when the action is taken up one zero

155
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,420
and then there is the

156
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,640
o stations assign then this correspondence

157
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,040
formula for the second action

158
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,710
and of course notes that the

159
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,270
the midline sites like the same except that the

160
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,390
all the time points

161
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,690
the implemented by one would be good

162
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,060
x y

163
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,000
one could

164
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,730
even by using them quite this is why is satisfiable

165
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,670
this value that satisfies the formula

166
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,730
one value of these properties

167
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,080
it was listed on the values

168
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,520
what the state variables in this that's fine valuation

169
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,230
we can see what other the states

170
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,250
the execution of this plan

171
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,730
the corresponding let's so the initial state

172
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:35,790
because they knew each is called describe uniquely so a of these through time three

173
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,520
and in the intermediates that something happens all

174
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,500
what has happened between one point zero one is that it has become falls

175
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,060
so this must be

176
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,560
because the

177
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,410
actually what they

178
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,890
actually it falls

179
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,390
then there is also difference between these

180
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,190
this standpoint point

181
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,060
what has happened is that it has become true

182
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,190
the walls

183
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,890
and this is what

184
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,370
what the second action

185
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,850
but does

186
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,560
what the plan system the first action

187
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,140
take the second action and in

188
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,910
the last difference here is again

189
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,770
can the first action so

190
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:35,170
the plan reactions first action a connection to the action then three rules

191
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,920
you may have noticed that this actually sort of

192
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,230
sort of like has

193
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,350
because actually the

194
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,690
well you know is the variables

195
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,210
the one

196
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,940
or satisfies goal one

197
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:12,480
if we have picked sort of planning you could have well defined simpler shorter life

198
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,690
i have out you'll have a nice example later but this is by using

199
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,390
if n

200
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,150
the definition of the

201
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:27,310
one slide different kind of translation from the formula

202
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,170
how this

203
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,310
translation be presented so far we call

204
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,370
efficiency of SAT solvers of program for testing the satisfiability of propositional formulas is strongly

205
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,310
depending on the

206
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,910
the size of the form

207
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,790
in the planet is this means that it's

208
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,920
very strong depending on the length of your eyes

209
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,620
this the horizon b

210
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,730
what is the

211
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,810
this that's always been trying find the black

212
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,920
for these reasons

213
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,870
one way of improving

214
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,500
translation from planning from set problems is

215
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,290
i've already used or i think one way is simply tool

216
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,290
more than one

217
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,910
every time so

218
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,750
o definition so far was based on

219
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,750
translating every action in this way

220
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,120
so that a reaction

221
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,270
something well this formula here the that

222
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,390
this actually takes place and of course nothing happens

223
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,960
not nothing else happens nothing that's

224
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,080
isn't that course action kind of course is implicit many of the same

225
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,370
so instead of using this definition where is

226
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,270
it's like the one that they have to be done

227
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:52,120
he was definition in which several actors and can take place simultaneously

228
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,060
this makes sense those

229
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,750
actually cite independent of each other and on into one of the ways

230
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,310
in ways i of images

231
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,370
you know many kinds of problems this allows to reduce the horizon length from by

232
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,980
by the fact like from one hundred ten

233
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,830
which means for example that the most points

234
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,080
perhaps selected simultaneous like sinatra simultaneously i

235
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:29,060
this is of course not applicable or from the many practical problems like this

236
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,540
are all of this is

237
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,210
the idea

238
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,580
of paralysing the plans while allowing

239
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,440
so well actually given by

240
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:53,290
it is based on the following conditions will be using so

241
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:59,420
consider those two actually the first line

242
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,310
the preconditions of this is actually saw

243
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,460
it consists so compatible with each other

244
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,910
and the effect also don't want to be so

245
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,520
what do we

246
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:20,350
take these actions in order be well have definitions of plans that allow these two

247
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,420
well been maybe forty b

248
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,920
london underground

249
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,300
which is expressed in english arguably uniform which should be easy to understand because if

250
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,030
it's not easy to understand and defeats this purpose you might as well not say

251
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,950
so look at these sentences

252
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,580
the first one press the alarm signal button to alert the driver

253
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,160
the set look like a sentence of logic

254
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,480
or does it look like gold reduction procedure

255
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,880
what is the goal to alert the driver

256
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,670
what is the so-called press the alarm signal button how do we represent goal reduction

257
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,540
procedures and logic programming as

258
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,830
conclusion condition rules the justification for this procedure is that you will alert the driver

259
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,330
if you press the alarm signal button

260
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,410
so the very first sentence is a procedural representation of logical

261
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,310
those people who love logic programming and say

262
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,140
logic programming is the declarative representation and that's what knowledge representation should be all about

263
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,390
would have us rewrite the sentence

264
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,380
as a declarative sentence

265
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,650
they would have to say

266
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,500
you want

267
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,830
they would have a say if you press the alarm signal button then the driver

268
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,430
will be alerted

269
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,000
probably a lot less effective than this

270
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,660
procedural way of

271
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,230
putting it

272
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:47,040
the second sentence obviously has logical form a lot and will form conclusion the driver

273
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,680
will stop condition any part of the train is in a station

274
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,160
there are things left out of this of course the driver will stop what

275
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,230
will stop feeding you are creating the problem

276
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,730
creating an emergency and of course not the driver will stop the train so natural

277
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,870
language has

278
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,810
features that are not present in the language of thought in the language of thought

279
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:12,230
if we understand the sentence we understand that the driver will stop the train

280
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,130
now you might say this that mean we should say the driver will stop the

281
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,560
the train maybe

282
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,180
but it goes for granted if you can take it for granted in

283
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,640
and we often leave out important

284
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:30,310
considerations context in particular which is necessary to actually understand the meaning for example the

285
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,060
driver will stop if any part of the train is in a station

286
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,580
provided the driver has been alerted to an emergency

287
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,290
so the second sentence has hidden extra conditions

288
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,600
coming from the first sentence but none the less

289
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,370
to understand this sentence you need to extract its meaning

290
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,770
and that meaning has a linguistic form has the logical form and it has a

291
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:57,700
simplified form of logic which is what we call clausal form

292
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,680
if not again another logical structure

293
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,230
the train will continue to the next station

294
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,960
blah blah blah

295
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,330
the last sentence there is a fifty pound penalty for improper use

296
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,020
if then

297
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,540
but is there a hidden

298
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,910
implication in all of this

299
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,980
what is the meaning of this if you put this in your head how do

300
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,540
you store these sentences what is it significant

301
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,770
i will tell you

302
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,730
figured out

303
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,980
i think you i hope you will

304
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
this is your problem not mine

305
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,060
so what is involved in understanding natural language

306
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,250
my argument is

307
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:49,250
our thoughts have linguistic forms that linguistic four is the logical forms that logical form

308
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,810
is a simplified form

309
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,730
which is

310
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,160
causal in nature

311
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,250
well we know

312
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,390
we all know that the first problem other of understanding natural language is to identify

313
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,310
the intended meanings to get rid of ambiguities obvious ambiguities at least he gave her

314
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,040
the book who who

315
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,770
who gave home the book

316
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,940
well let's say it's john gave mary the book

317
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,330
so the first

318
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,790
problem is to identify to be

319
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,660
to get closer to logic

320
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,080
logic does not have he in her doesn't have these indefinite pronouns

321
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:29,790
the second thing is to represent the meaning in a canonical form john gave mary

322
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,390
the book john gave the book to mary mary received the book the book was

323
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,120
given to mary by john

324
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,040
you can

325
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,960
x you can store

326
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,890
that kind of knowledge

327
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,660
in your head

328
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,980
the only way to to

329
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,790
deal with the world is to represent knowledge in the standard form in the canonical

330
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,850
form to process it in canonical form

331
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,830
OK this is this is an old-fashioned syntax

332
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,460
john gives the book to mary say as event one thousand

333
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,710
this is the this is the classical symbolic notation but you know that that's just

334
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,680
notation is not even syntax

335
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,290
you know you can invent any other notation you like without changing the syntax but

336
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,080
the point is that

337
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,810
to understand natural language we have to have a canonical form we we have to

338
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:23,430
represent knowledge and conditional form clausal form is the canonical form is the conjunctive normal

339
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,040
form of first-order logic

340
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,520
where there are no

341
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:34,430
existential quantifiers anymore and the existential quantifiers go away because they don't provide enough information

342
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:41,000
it's more expressive to have clausal form without existential quantifiers then to have a full

343
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,060
unstructured of first order logic

344
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,060
so my argument is the clausal form

345
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:54,000
before we use an abductive logic programming is much closer to the language of thought

346
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,180
then say first order logic

347
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,440
for example in clausal form we we would say that

348
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,660
that if x is the burden x has further john bird

349
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,680
we wouldn't say as we say in standard first order logic these crazy things

350
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,910
standard first order logic

351
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,500
is gobbledygook

352
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,790
no wonder natural languages so hard to understand this because it allows us to say

353
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:23,060
what first-order logic says we don't want to first order logic we want to canonical

354
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:30,660
form which simplifies representation so we can manipulate them easily and understand what people

355
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,850
attempting to communicate

356
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:40,660
so the argument therefore as i said is that clausal logic

357
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,910
it is

358
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,080
a potential candidate for

359
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,540
the language of thought

360
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:54,500
and the advantage of that is that reasoning in clausal logic is far far simpler

361
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,520
than reasoning in first order logic

362
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,600
it can be reduced to forward and backward reasoning as in the abductive logic programming

363
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,210
agent model

364
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,640
as in production systems as in logic programming

365
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,520
and it can be extended to include resolution so you can compile

366
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,730
you can compile complicated beliefs into simpler beliefs

367
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,790
you can

368
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:24,370
lemmas is if you like

369
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,020
the second theme of my talk

370
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,910
is that

371
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:36,180
artificial intelligence can help people not only to make better smarter decisions

372
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,330
you have ten days left

373
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,300
for your model

374
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,300
so it's a nice project for spring break

375
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,290
i'll give you some hints

376
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,330
keep the fraction of year low as you can

377
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,290
you can use any or of course that's not allowed

378
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,160
balance your road

379
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,480
the best you can

380
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,700
and try to avoid that the rotor begins to bond begins to vibrate

381
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,180
because when it vibrated loses contact

382
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,450
with the current when it needs it so there's no trick

383
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,800
i will be test

384
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,240
your motors

385
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,170
we don't just destroy was called

386
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,020
and i decided to

387
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,530
demonstrate to you how are we going to do that

388
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,840
that's probably

389
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,810
the best thing to do

390
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,670
we have this

391
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,560
we're going to rotate to disk

392
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,120
thousand RPM let's assume that is your model

393
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,840
and we're going to struggle with it

394
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,330
with a strobe light

395
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,100
until it stands still

396
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,040
in this case

397
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,760
i've said this rope

398
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,180
so to stand still roughly

399
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,930
and the problem is now going at five hundred rpm and the motor is going

400
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,880
at thousand rpm

401
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,210
so this clearly is not

402
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,130
the rotation rate of your

403
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,960
in fact you motor goals twice around between the buildings

404
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,460
and we have no way of knowing that so we double the frequency

405
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,370
i'm trying to double it now

406
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,180
double the frequency of blinking

407
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,650
of the

408
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,300
strobe light

409
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,630
and outstanding skill again

410
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,910
so now we may think that your motive is going thousand RPM but we don't

411
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:28,150
know yet maybe it's going three thousand two thousand rpm

412
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,370
maybe three thousand rpm

413
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,300
so we're going to do now we're going to double the frequency

414
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,100
so we go now is the strobe light

415
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:43,040
the two thousand rpm

416
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,520
and what we see now

417
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,500
see double image

418
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,500
so two thousand RPM is out

419
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,580
in any multiple of two thousand rpms is out so four thousand is out six

420
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,490
thousand and eight thousand is out

421
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,840
and what is not yet out is three thousand and five thousand and seven thousand

422
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,680
so we would have to test for that

423
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,150
on the other hand i told you already that this model is going one thousand

424
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:12,810
RPM so there no census testing that now but doing the actual contest of course

425
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,460
we will continue all the way until we are convinced that we have the right

426
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,360
rpm for your motives

427
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,370
so that's the way we will do it will put a little bit of white

428
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,420
on one side of the road

429
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,080
so that's the way it will be done

430
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,150
of course if your model is highly unstable in terms of rotation rate

431
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,740
i will not be easy

432
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,780
to get to right correct number

433
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,520
i want to talk with you about

434
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,650
the heart

435
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,920
the heart

436
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,750
heart has four chambers

437
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,190
looks for like this

438
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,590
he left a tree

439
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,310
and the right him

440
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,300
maybe that's why this is why it's called the heart

441
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,150
and here is the left

442
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,360
and the are on the right

443
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,810
and here's a order

444
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,750
the soul

445
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,270
the purpose of the heart

446
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,770
is to pump blood

447
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,690
about five courts community

448
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,360
which is seventy five gallons per hour

449
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,770
which is seventy barrels day

450
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,680
it is about

451
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,420
million barrels in seventy five years

452
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,680
and it funds

453
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,620
about seventy times per minute

454
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,370
if the block to your brain stops for about five seconds

455
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,090
you lose consciousness

456
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,620
so was five skips of the heart beat

457
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,440
and you down on the floor

458
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,120
four minutes later

459
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,340
brain damage

460
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,210
the way hard work is absolutely mind-boggling

461
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,640
extremely complicated

462
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,910
nature had one billion years two

463
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,240
design but nevertheless it's impressive

464
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,700
each heart cells

465
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
these are many

466
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,950
chemical batteries

467
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,420
and poems ions it around as it pleases

468
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,800
in the normal state

469
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,450
it's hard sell

470
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,820
these mines

471
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,040
eighty million fold on the inside

472
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,360
relative to the outside

473
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,220
there are some cells which are called

474
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,940
pacemaker cells

475
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,180
they are located

476
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,990
a very small area about one square millimeter

477
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,600
the right atrium

478
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,140
they change their

479
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,260
o tential from minus eighty million volts

480
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,810
plus twenty million people

481
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:41,740
why do that is a different story which i will not address

482
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,950
once they go to plus twenty manifolds

483
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,750
the neighbouring cells

484
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,990
anyway propagates over the heart

485
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,330
make your drawing shortly

486
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,180
so the way first

487
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,870
move over the age will chambers and then

488
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,180
over the

489
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,700
ventricle chambers

490
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:06,640
and when the cells are least twenty million falls inside relative to the outside

491
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,480
the contract

492
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,180
today former muscles

493
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,720
the whole heart

494
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,870
is one

495
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,560
big muscle

496
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,370
and after about two-tenths of a second

497
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
the cells return

498
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,120
two miners eighty manifold

499
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,490
in this way

500
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,430
goes from below

501
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,810
two above

502
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,120
and then the whole thing weights again for another message from the pacemaker cells

503
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,860
takes about one second and then the whole process starts all of over

504
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,440
now i want to be more precise

505
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,480
he is one

506
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,980
heart cells

507
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:46,010
but this is about ten microns in size

508
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,290
and this cell has eighty manifold

509
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,370
with respect to the outside

510
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,470
but that means

511
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,990
it has repel positive ions

512
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,870
so inside

513
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,760
and there is no he feels outside

514
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,830
he put gulshan service around here there is no net

515
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,160
charge inside

516
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,240
but there is of course a

517
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,510
electric field across the world here

518
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,870
from plus to minus

519
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,690
now the depolarisation which this the change to the

520
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,670
and then we can see the different variations

521
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,040
so only using the geometry important results

522
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,160
o nine using the hamming embedding

523
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:37,120
four three thousand feet combined two of them together we further improve the results

524
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,420
and you can see that the improvement is actually substantial so if you look at

525
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,950
the data set of one million images here

526
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,780
we have

527
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:51,310
mean average precision of three and then by just adding make dramatic and having these

528
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,540
double mean average precision

529
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,930
and then what i said before actually if we had this reranking step

530
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,890
we can see that it allows to further improve the results right so actually what

531
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,950
this picture much even the hamming embedding that it gives us back much more true

532
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,650
positive in the short list and if you apply the real ranking can still further

533
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,950
improve the results so the two of them be geometry and fortunately the complementary

534
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,030
one is really big filter which improve results and the second one really verifies the

535
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,750
results and so based on the three ranking most results actually correct

536
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,710
the ones which have been found correct

537
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,750
and you can see here as well this is interesting

538
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,980
if you look at the CPU which is

539
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,930
it is consumed so there's

540
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,950
this is for computational which good quantisation and then if you look at the search

541
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:44,100
time for searching we can see that the overall search time for hamming embedding and

542
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,800
weak geometric consistency

543
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,330
is comparable to the baseline

544
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,570
actually had before the hamming embedding allows to find much matches scriptures and therefore less

545
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:59,520
memory access to reduce the search time the geometry the joint constraint

546
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:04,280
increases that both together and others to have the same same search time as before

547
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,250
so it's really it's feasible to use this approach is time consuming

548
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,180
and if you're a real example so this is the query

549
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,680
and this is what the for the first five without which system returns and is

550
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,970
actually nice like this example because they only give back the images of the

551
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:27,520
the retrieve stored explicitly in the dataset but also find similar images in flickr flickr

552
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,340
has expressed interest which is similar to the query found automatically

553
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:35,150
and if you compare our approach to the bag of features and si

554
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,420
in green

555
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,990
the ranking obtained for the images our approach to the first fourth and fifth these

556
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,840
are the ones which we have in our dataset and then refused to the bag

557
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,950
of features we can actually see the very far behind this decision for five thousand

558
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:57,790
eight hundred to basically even with this geometrically ranking being their removed to the top

559
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,600
and similar further mathematical so we don't find all images here in the form of

560
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,750
recall i don't find all of images which you have put into our dataset but

561
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:12,230
only a subset of them so here for the first six retrieved images with ninety

562
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,040
again we find also images from flickr which show

563
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,620
which correspond to the query

564
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:23,090
and so i don't know what we want to get the demo because but because

565
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,960
i just laptops to

566
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,810
conclude so we're seeing that we obtained excellent results for large scale image search

567
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,390
how did this online

568
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:40,890
and the one million people think dataset contains request expanding with quite extended this work

569
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,550
two videos and

570
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,610
here i show just one result from the trecvid competition to the competition is two

571
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:53,430
hundred hours of videos and have is to find the deform video in the dataset

572
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,980
so you can see here

573
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,020
the upper

574
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:00,720
the upper left the upper right corner here corresponds to the image in the czech

575
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,570
the dataset

576
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:07,330
and what you want to retrieve the corresponding image correctly from collection of two hundred

577
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,420
twenty hours of video sickening feeling our system performs extremely well

578
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:18,390
here the images he scaled so so it's much smaller it inserted in the image

579
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,890
and there some ways the in which it is so this is the tricky task

580
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:26,400
right attribute is because have the data set that set of videos and you want

581
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,680
to find deformed copies in this dataset and i think

582
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:33,640
applications is that for example

583
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:39,120
mean producers want to see where their copies go to basic there is a large

584
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,690
market for this and if you just

585
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:47,300
compare one of the results we have obtained the trec competition so

586
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,890
the most difficult the

587
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,510
difficult transformation

588
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,060
was the combined had fun for information so having this is scant end of the

589
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,560
video noise and insertion you can see here

590
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,070
but our three approaches

591
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,930
also called perform significantly better than the other best once right again here you have

592
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,330
recall and precision and

593
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,230
if submitted three different ones

594
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,440
this one is just based on the key frames the ones to the key frames

595
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:19,530
the red and green once still more frames for for short right

596
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,810
and you can just outside you can idea can we see that our system outperforms

597
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,430
systems of the other people

598
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:09,800
maybe you can take questions well so now the the second part is the demo

599
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,540
but it can quickly questions well

600
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,510
frank is

601
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:27,620
any questions

602
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:33,850
so we have to

603
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,050
i could lead to ask the question

604
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,690
in the most unusual with the video

605
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,580
well you

606
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,140
do you know if you have look at the face

607
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,900
two months

608
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,600
you're saying on the

609
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,850
you want see

610
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,180
one four

611
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,530
and what

612
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,140
these people

613
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,810
well the

614
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,420
the face of

615
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,670
we are not really

616
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,610
it is

617
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,980
so although our

618
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,430
you are right

619
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:36,320
here it is

620
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,000
the one

621
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,960
he said

622
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,240
o and one

623
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,170
of what

624
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,960
in my

625
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:38,320
right now

626
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:48,360
one he

627
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,120
the result

628
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:08,220
i'm sure

629
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,930
then this would have been

630
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:17,010
i couldn't have used that as the pivot but i could have exchanged again

631
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,760
in this case

632
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:23,560
in this case because what when can i when can i get out of trouble

633
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,110
i can get out of trouble if there's a non-zero below

634
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,570
this is this troublesome zero

635
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,170
and there is here

636
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,610
so i would be OK

637
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:38,400
in this case if this was the sixth i would survive by rho exchange

638
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,150
of course

639
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,850
might have happened that i could do the romeo that that there was zero below

640
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,450
it but was now

641
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,540
i can also got in trouble

642
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,390
this number one was a little different

643
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,940
the that one became of five i guess by the end

644
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,890
so do you can use the what numbers there would have got me

645
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,740
the trouble that i really

646
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,980
i couldn't get out of

647
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,690
trouble that i couldn't get out of wood mean

648
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,110
if the pivot is

649
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,040
o right

650
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,100
if if zeroes in the pivot position and i can't

651
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,140
i've got no place to exchange

652
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,070
so the must be some number

653
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,200
which if i had had here it would have meant failure

654
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,420
negative for good

655
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:37,850
was the negative four here if it happened to be in negative for the night

656
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,400
i'll temporarily put up here

657
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,960
if if this event negative

658
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,320
for the

659
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,560
and i would have

660
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,290
gone through the same steps what have been the minus four it still would have

661
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,690
been my four

662
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:54,010
but at the last minute what have become

663
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,950
and there wouldn't have been a third pivot

664
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,170
the matrix would have not been invertible

665
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,430
the inverse of a matrix is coming next week but

666
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:13,700
you've heard these words before so that that's not always we identify failure

667
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,060
this temporary failure when we

668
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,940
you can doro exchange and get out of it

669
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:22,850
or there is complete failure when we get a zero and

670
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:26,580
and there's nothing below that we can you OK

671
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,010
stay with

672
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,190
back to success

673
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,820
in fact i guess the next topic is back substitution

674
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,960
so what's back substitution well

675
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,610
that the

676
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,490
now i better bring the right side

677
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,440
so what would matlab do

678
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,870
and what should we do

679
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:52,370
to bring in the right hand side as an extra column

680
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,920
so there can be so it's two twelve two

681
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:05,090
this is i i would call this the augmented matrix augment means your something on

682
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,640
i've tacked on this extra column

683
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,700
because when i'm working with equations

684
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:14,780
i do the same thing to both sides

685
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,740
at this step

686
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,920
i subtracted two of the first equation away from the second equation so that

687
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,400
still i even brought some color chart but i don't know

688
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,920
if it shows up so this is like that

689
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,810
certainly the wrong thing

690
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,480
OK here's the

691
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,800
here b

692
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:44,850
OK that's the extra column OK so what happened

693
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,110
so that extra column the right hand side of the equation

694
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,900
when i did the first step so that was three in this away from this

695
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,100
so it took

696
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,430
the to stay the same

697
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,270
but three two twos got taken away from twelve leaving six

698
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:03,660
and that to stay the same so this is the

699
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,890
how it's looking halfway along

700
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,100
and let me just carry to the end

701
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,690
and the six the same

702
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,910
what i have here

703
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,330
o cash

704
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:24,060
help me out now what so now i'm i'm this is this is still like

705
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,210
forward elimination

706
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,510
i got to this point which i think is right

707
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,790
now what did i do with this step by multiply that payment by two the

708
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:36,700
whole equation by two and subtracted from that

709
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,510
so i think i take two sixes which is twelve away from the two

710
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,140
you think minus ten

711
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,460
is my final right-hand side

712
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,780
the right hand side that goes with you and we call that

713
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,660
once and forever

714
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,600
the vector c

715
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,230
so c is what happens to be

716
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:58,450
and you

717
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,800
it is what happens to a

718
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,180
OK there you've seen elimination

719
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,820
what's back substitution

720
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,630
so so what are my final equations that can i can i

721
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,050
copy these equations

722
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,060
x one two y

723
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,310
was the

724
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,290
two is still there

725
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,070
and two y

726
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,820
minus two the

727
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,580
six there

728
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:29,560
and five

729
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,770
the miners

730
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:35,130
those are the equations that are

731
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,260
that these

732
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,360
numbers are telling me about

733
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,300
those the

734
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,650
ways in the u

735
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:43,810
x equals the

736
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:45,710
OK how do i sell them

737
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:47,270
will also be optimal

738
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,040
so this is the policy improvement theorem and it's the basis of the policy iteration

739
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,270
three try to use this fact to

740
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:04,120
somehow use developer emaar a monte carlo based approach to policy improvement

741
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:05,720
so i

742
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,860
computing pi prime amounts to maximizing this q function

743
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:14,750
how can we use the bandit ideas to solve this to compute pi prime

744
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,040
that's the question

745
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:21,090
so set up our bandit were some state as we have our k actions

746
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:26,720
well we're going to do is to find a stochastic function which we can implement

747
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,510
we're going to call it simpkins

748
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,520
we defined so stochastic function

749
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:36,030
and the expected value if we run this function

750
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,090
over and over and over is going to be equal to the q function

751
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,020
so intuitively is i show you in the next slide this is simply going to

752
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,980
simulate taking action a in following the policy

753
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,600
and is about the reward

754
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,340
very simple to implement

755
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:55,170
if we could do this if we can generate figure out what this how to

756
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:01,520
simulate this function and how to implement this function since the expected value is q

757
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,300
we can use our

758
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:10,940
uniformbandit algorithm to get a PAC result for selecting an approximately optimal improved action

759
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,440
and in approximately improved action

760
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,290
how do we implement simq u

761
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,880
it's actually pretty simple so

762
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,300
so say we pull this arm

763
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,170
and this is the function that we're

764
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,590
get implemented

765
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:32,780
it somehow using a simulator so what do we do we are just going to

766
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,110
put the simulator in state s

767
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,660
so that's the first thing we do

768
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:42,220
we're going to use the simulator will take action a wall and up in some

769
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,810
state according to our transition function

770
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:48,960
and going to simulate then at each day we can look at pi

771
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:52,300
figure out what action it suggests take that action we end up in a new

772
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:56,290
state we do that for each minus one steps

773
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:59,660
we sum up the rewards that we saw and this is what we output for

774
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,420
some q

775
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:07,890
this is a random function because these trajectories are random trajectories because our simulators random

776
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:12,270
so that's how we do some q four a one

777
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,290
do the same thing for the other actions

778
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:21,070
so so some q is easy to implement if you have the simulator i think

779
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:25,720
we could agree on that it's also easy to verify that the expected

780
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:31,640
that then q is the actual q functions sort sort of by definition

781
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:36,440
it sort of doesn't even need to proof it's it

782
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,750
we have an algorithm for policy improvement now

783
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:45,830
using our simulator so

784
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:47,490
for each arm

785
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,290
we're going to run sim q w times right

786
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:52,870
these are these are

787
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,170
basically different runs of the same q function

788
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:57,640
and these

789
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:03,050
values are just the total rewards that we observed when we ran some q

790
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:07,040
and then we're going to return they are has the highest

791
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:13,350
its highest average these values and according to our uniformbandit resulted tells us well if

792
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:17,100
we really wanted to pick w so that we get a PAC guarantee we get

793
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,620
a PAC guarantee on

794
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:23,220
choosing an approximately improved action

795
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:36,010
right right so so the situation you want to imagine is your robot

796
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,840
you're in the state of the world

797
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:39,060
that's as

798
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,330
and now

799
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:41,870
you're trying to pick an action

800
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:46,490
so in in your head you're going to do all of this stuff with pi

801
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:51,870
and then you're going to pick the one that that that maximizes that so you

802
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:55,560
don't change pipe that leads into the next thing

803
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,760
i think it's fairly

804
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,010
you could nest rollouts right

805
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,140
so we could stick and here's sort of pi we could stack it stick and

806
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,530
the rollout

807
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,160
policy of pi

808
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,030
i think that's the next slide

809
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,970
no so without becoming a moment so this

810
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:20,550
it was just finish up the rollout so so basically what we need to know

811
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:24,790
how many samples we need to generate well for each machine

812
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:32,580
we need to generate h times w samples there are k machines so the number

813
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:35,200
of calls to the simulator which is sort of

814
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:42,100
the dominating complexity here is khw everything else is just a constant we're doing additions

815
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,140
over k things and what not

816
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:51,500
but no unique origin

817
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,330
just like the plane or vector

818
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,520
so in other words i can't

819
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:59,120
say that the translation moves us from here to here

820
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:04,520
or from here to here it's all the same thing magnitude and direction no unique

821
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:11,790
in fact all of these

822
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:16,980
i have translational periodicity

823
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,410
is the translation in this part of the pattern and another translation from here to

824
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:25,660
to here in the middle

825
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,980
the thing that makes a crystal crystal

826
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,790
is that

827
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:34,270
it is an arrangement of atoms or molecules

828
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:40,620
which is related to one part to another by the operation of translation

829
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,620
if you don't have translational periodicity

830
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,350
you do not have a crystal

831
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:46,520
so that's

832
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,940
come to the essence of what crystallography is about

833
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,980
you can imagine

834
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,270
in one sense

835
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:56,350
the generation of this pattern by

836
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,500
a rubber stamp sort of operation

837
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,500
because i have a rubber stamp

838
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,060
and i put on the rubber stamp

839
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,040
the pair of motifs like this

840
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,060
pick it up move it over time

841
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:15,730
pick it up move it over to i can stamp out the pattern that fashion

842
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:21,190
notice that my statement about no unique origin in these terms can be so stated

843
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,790
that doesn't matter where the two motifs are on the stamp

844
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:28,620
it could be up in the upper left-hand corner right in the middle down on

845
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:33,270
the bottom as long as i move the stamp through the same distance in the

846
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:34,410
same direction

847
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,750
i get the same pattern

848
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:42,040
that's not bad for an introduction but i want to be more

849
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,410
general than this

850
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:51,600
because one idea in in terms of a stamp operation is a transformation that involves

851
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,560
taking one little chunk

852
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:58,710
of the two dimensional space picking it up and more putting it down in another

853
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:01,140
location to another unique

854
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,520
location in space

855
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:09,960
so i'm going to make another generalization is that

856
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:13,480
o operations which was begun to the final

857
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:24,930
act on all of space

858
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:28,750
so i don't want to think of this repetition in terms of a rubber stamp

859
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:32,790
although we could get the pattern that way and it's conceptually appealing

860
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:36,060
but i'm going to say now that this

861
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:40,390
string of motifs has translational periodicity

862
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,810
if one might pick it up

863
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:49,270
move by t in a particular direction and throughout the whole incident chain back down

864
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:54,830
again it is mapped into congruence with itself

865
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:58,620
which leads me to another definition

866
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:09,290
an object or space

867
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:19,770
possesses symmetry

868
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:33,120
there's an operation

869
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:45,040
or set of operations

870
00:53:45,060 --> 00:54:07,060
that maps it into congruence with itself

871
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:29,190
in other words in plain words you can tell that it's been moved

872
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:35,020
he is or anything else that is the transformation which leaves the set

873
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,930
in very

874
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,980
OK if we look at the first order

875
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,770
there are

876
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:44,560
o site such as this one here

877
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,330
or this one here

878
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,330
or this one here

879
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,750
about which i can

880
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:58,140
one motif into its neighbour or for that matter pick up the entire chain and

881
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,520
flipped end over elbow

882
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:05,810
through one hundred eighty degrees in it will be mapped into coincidence with itself

883
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:13,000
and that is an operation and another sort of the sting operation of transformation and

884
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,730
this is one that i could call rotation

885
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:23,160
for obvious reasons

886
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:27,020
and there are two things i have to tell you about the rotation operations

887
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:32,410
the first one is the point about which the rotation takes place

888
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:38,690
and that's going to be some point in that we call this point here eight

889
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:49,890
so this will be some labelled point that is the location of the

890
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:54,980
rotation axis

891
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,160
but then the other thing i have to tell you is the angle through which

892
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,690
i'm going to rotate

893
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:12,960
our hands to be a as the subscript the angle of rotation

894
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:18,770
so this particular operation called the two fold rotation because it rotates through half the

895
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:23,540
circle would be the operation a pied

896
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:28,460
this point is a we rotate through an angle pi

897
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,330
this pattern here has

898
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,500
rotational symmetry

899
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:40,790
in addition to the translation there is the rotation operation a pie in the lower

900
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:43,310
so the

901
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:47,550
going to do is give you an updated version of the tutorial i gave at NIPS so if you

902
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:52,650
came to my NIPS tutorial in 2007 there's some new bits, but it's mostly the

903
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:55,040
same as the NIPS tutorial in 2007

904
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,460
and what you'll learn about is

905
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:04,460
an efficient way to learn multilayer generative models from unlabelled data by learning one layer

906
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:08,880
of features at time, that's basically the main content of the tutorial, that's it is we you learn

907
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,110
about you learn about ways to extend it to have markov random fields in each

908
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:16,570
layer that is lateral interactions

909
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,550
how to

910
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,910
having learned these deep nets

911
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,530
how to make them work well for discrimination and classification

912
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:28,760
and how to combine them with modern kernel methods like Gaussian processes

913
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:34,280
how to use these methods to do explicit dimensionality reduction on very big data sets

914
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:37,590
and how they can help with things like fast document retrieval

915
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:41,550
and also how to apply the same methods to sequential data

916
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,220
first for

917
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:46,520
making background characters from movies for example

918
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:52,640
so to start with i want to draw distinction between two types of machine learning

919
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,110
task. there's what i think of as typical statistics

920
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:01,370
where you typically have low dimensional data maybe less than a hundred dimensions

921
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,590
there's often a lot of noise in the data

922
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,150
there's typically not much structure in the data set typical

923
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,530
thing would be say some medical statistics on who died after some heart operation who

924
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:16,210
didn't, you have sort of the blood pressure and their age and stuff like that

925
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,120
the main problem is not

926
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,660
thinking that the noise in the data is real structure

927
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:26,400
so financial prediction typically is in this range whereas almost all noise

928
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:30,150
that is, all noise

929
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:34,200
artificial intelligence is the other end of the spectrum where

930
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,200
you typically have high dimensional data

931
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:41,530
this is the sort of perceptual artificial intelligence

932
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:45,060
there's a lot of structure and the noise isn't sufficient to sort of completely it's

933
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:47,700
obscure the structure if you look at things right

934
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:53,090
and the problem is to have some representational scheme powerful enough to be able to

935
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:54,480
represent the structure

936
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:59,160
but simple enough to allow you to learn it from data

937
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:03,590
so typically what we have is we have methods that will learn from data

938
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,080
like EM algorithm

939
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:07,360
but without very powerful representations of

940
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,490
or methods that

941
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:11,500
how very powerful like classical AI

942
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:17,090
representations but you don't know how to learn them from data

943
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:23,390
so a little bit of historical background. I'm gonna trash neural networks in three slides

944
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:25,990
in the nineteen sixties

945
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:30,850
people developed perceptrons late fifties and sixties and this is what the a typical perceptron

946
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:31,470
looked like

947
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:32,740
you had some

948
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:37,330
inputs and i will focus on process images so let's poses the pixels

949
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:41,040
you had some features that were designed by hand, these could have been little bits of computer

950
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,630
program but you could also think of perhaps fixed feature detectors

951
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:51,550
and then we learned weights connecting your features to decision units

952
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,860
and there was a very nice guarantee that if you

953
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,580
did things in a simple way

954
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:00,470
you were guaranteed to find a set of weights that would always make the right choice

955
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,830
if any such set of weights existed. the problem was, in an architecture this simple

956
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:08,140
for complicated problems, there would typically be no set of weights that could do the job so

957
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,740
the guarantee was rather vacuous

958
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,000
nevertheless people like Google use this kind of algorithm a lot on big data sets

959
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:24,440
what i think as a second generation neural networks allowed you to learn multiple layers of weights that

960
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,700
was seen as a big breakthrough you could learn the strengths of the connections in multiple

961
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,310
and back propagation algorithm

962
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:35,470
which was invented by lots of different people

963
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,010
you start with an input vector

964
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:43,360
and you go--you go feed forward through the neural net, you compare the output you get

965
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,850
with the correct answer

966
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:48,460
and then you take some measure of that discrepancy and go backwards through the neural

967
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,480
computing derivatives for these weights

968
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:56,920
i'm not going to the details of how you do it, but it's essentially just the chain rule

969
01:00:56,970 --> 01:01:00,440
and the time it seemed very exciting because it seemed we could learn multiple layers of

970
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,450
representation, and indeed on toy problems we could

971
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:10,090
but was rather a disappointment when used on big problems

972
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:15,400
it basically has been supplanted in the nineties by support vector machines

973
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:21,250
as the sort of method of choice for tackling some problem you don't understand

974
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,450
so you could think of the support vector machines

975
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,000
as having

976
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:32,190
instead of having hand coded features taking training examples and for each training example

977
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,160
automatically creating a feature

978
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:37,190
this isn't the sense of feature they talk about when they talk about high dimensional

979
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:43,730
feature spaces, it's the sense of feature that perceptrons have. so you turn each training example into a feature

980
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:47,700
the feature is essentially: how similar is a test case to this training example

981
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,470
that's the value of the feature

982
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,300
and then you have a very clever way of

983
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:56,900
eliminating most of those features

984
01:01:56,910 --> 01:02:02,550
and simultaneously as you do this elimination figure out the weights to put on the other features

985
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,410
to make sensible decisions

986
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,200
it turns out that works

987
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:10,250
views there already are just kind of in the summary of the views often it's

988
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:14,720
a good idea to kind of put a similar amount of information into the RDF

989
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:18,570
redundancy in this case is OK it's not a problem i have to say proposed

990
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:25,470
symbols these these documents thing of web pages web pages incredibly redundant orders navigation stuff

991
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:27,530
around the continent the same on every page

992
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:30,900
and it's not really a problem

993
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:33,920
OK semantic sitemap that's the last step

994
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:37,460
you need to do this makes alot of sense to do this if you want

995
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,170
to publish linked data but you also have a sparql endpoint or

996
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,300
RDF dump of data

997
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:45,840
in that case the semantics that simply away

998
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:49,980
two let callers like red cross an RDF crawlers find

999
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:52,250
those times into sparql endpoint

1000
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:56,510
basically you put a simple XML file online just a few lines

1001
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,680
when you say

1002
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,530
what is your data set and basically you just

1003
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,290
at the end of the day you say here's the location of the data that

1004
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:07,900
appears to do you by of the sparql endpoint

1005
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:09,310
so this is just kind of

1006
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:14,240
so that's the finishing touches that you can apply to you

1007
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:18,280
this i'm afraid i basically have to skip but i would just say

1008
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:24,510
popular tool if you already have RDF data you have it in an RDF store

1009
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:25,890
you can use pubby

1010
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,010
to add a link to a different to this

1011
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:31,920
set of RDF like to the RDF data

1012
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,650
he to if you have an existing database

1013
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,920
relational database

1014
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:37,470
you can use the tool server

1015
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:39,530
two to expose

1016
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:43,790
the linked data view on the data and the server in the database

1017
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:52,370
tool if you have like the this this lamp applications like linux apache mysql PHP

1018
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,120
perl or whatever

1019
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:59,900
in for these applications to advisory very nice simple php script that you can use

1020
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,340
two to eat some linked data

1021
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:04,480
used to to the applications

1022
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:09,160
and yet but in any case it's also not such a such a huge effort

1023
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:12,500
to your to build your own application

1024
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:17,960
if you ever actually working dynamic HMS is already then it's fairly straightforward to

1025
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:23,510
at these RDF versions of the HTML pages and at the continuity equation in there

1026
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,830
and then you don't get to

1027
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:27,240
all right so

1028
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:29,760
that these have been the seven steps

1029
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:31,250
and i just want

1030
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:36,270
look back at those principles that we saw in the

1031
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:37,510
at the beginning of

1032
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:38,770
of the tutorial

1033
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:45,150
and just just just let's see how these are like how are supported these principles

1034
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:46,530
are supported by the

1035
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:48,950
by the steps of this before

1036
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,340
visualise names for things you we did be assigned

1037
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,980
your eyes to the entities

1038
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,510
is actually you are with this

1039
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:58,310
so they can be looked up

1040
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:03,520
provide useful information in RDF we did this by having these these these data pages

1041
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:07,270
chance of RDF and by having

1042
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,990
each entity

1043
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:14,160
connects to one of the data page is either by opening hash or by doing

1044
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,200
redirect to see redirects from the URI to the data

1045
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:21,950
and finally included include RDF links to other UIC

1046
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:25,730
we've done this to some extent when we have sliced data sets of course

1047
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:30,730
description will also still include the UID of of the other and related entities so

1048
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,010
the the

1049
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:35,620
brands that includes the URI of the whisky often

1050
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:38,320
of the of the reviews and

1051
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:42,190
but we have not yet talked about external links

1052
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,690
two other datasets

1053
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,210
and that's of course and other kind of RDF link that you should definitely include

1054
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:49,070
into your data and that's

1055
01:05:49,160 --> 01:06:00,180
what's what's coming like

1056
01:06:00,490 --> 01:07:01,710
OK so what we're gonna do now is just to give you a quick overview

1057
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:07,470
of some of the the methods we can use what we want to take

1058
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:10,470
data published in RDF on the web and the web now

1059
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:14,650
in particular domain it it's not just to other data within our own dataset but

1060
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:19,010
to data that comes from other datasets and other other namespaces

1061
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,520
as you saw

1062
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:24,710
earlier on this

1063
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:28,490
a great many other datasets already you can link to this is quite an old

1064
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:32,570
copy of the diagram

1065
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:37,750
but there's already an histogram you can there are things like the

1066
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:41,080
like g aims you might be interested in linking to

1067
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:58,170
datasets but that they are KB stuff really needs to be to be split out

1068
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,580
into individual

1069
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:08,750
into separate distinct datasets and represented as such but i think that i don't know

1070
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:13,400
whether they all available as is it this effectively crawlable or is it just there's

1071
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,730
lots of data in each one of the individual and point

1072
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:25,820
in that case it should certainly be be split out this for thirteen or more

1073
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:29,940
OK so

1074
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,070
triangular sort

1075
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:38,840
so obviously can use any

1076
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:40,240
predicate you want

1077
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:45,750
so that's designed to be used for filling in different bits together to actually connect

1078
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:49,520
across different datasets you can do so you can take any recovery has appropriate predicates

1079
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:52,510
and then use those for creating links different datasets

1080
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:56,920
there are few kind of patterns that crop up again and again we talked about

1081
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:01,890
al-samoud which is one of the most commonly used predictors which is really about saying

1082
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,500
this thing

1083
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,700
their own

1084
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:12,620
grace what we call people only care about their own greater technical term for them

1085
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:15,600
in england i think we refer to these guys

1086
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,260
ten or not

1087
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:22,680
as evil deeds

1088
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:26,470
it this not perhaps the most moral people in the universe

1089
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:27,670
all right

1090
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:32,300
so now we can ask a different question suppose with these actually powerful not pretend

1091
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,590
they often have

1092
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:37,700
that's suppose your payoff now we can ask not what did you do

1093
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,820
but what should you do now we have secondary switch the questions in order question

1094
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:47,760
what should you do and it's come back to close the clarity was paralyzed for

1095
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:52,040
mike and you get to just explain what you did and why again

1096
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,840
why is some sort of

1097
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:59,350
you should you should alpha doing is we're up to your payoff small as well

1098
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:02,430
you can make a great featured

1099
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:08,590
so what need features of the people support is that

1100
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:13,110
two different after that were high shows

1101
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:18,410
so what you are saying it's important idea is this and tell me if i'm

1102
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:21,040
paraphrasing you incorrectly but i think this is more of a saying

1103
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:25,480
it is no matter what the other person doesn't what the pair does

1104
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:28,340
she obtained a higher payoff

1105
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,460
i choosing alpha to see that if the pair

1106
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,050
choose alpha

1107
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:36,680
and she chooses then she gets zero

1108
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:41,960
if the patches alpha teachers be that she gets minus one zero is bigger than

1109
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,360
minus one

1110
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:46,130
if the player chooses beats

1111
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:48,300
the future alpha to get three

1112
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:49,620
she gets one

1113
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:53,360
three is bigger than one so in both cases no matter what the other person

1114
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:57,330
she received a higher payoff from choosing health

1115
01:10:57,330 --> 01:10:59,460
so she's issues out

1116
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:04,470
well that that that line everything that's a stronger line of reasoning than the reason

1117
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:07,430
we had earlier so that's what i merely forgot the name of in the red

1118
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:10,530
his name was

1119
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:14,910
courtney so-called also gave a reason for choosing alpha and the perfectly good reason you

1120
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:18,440
have nothing wrong with it but noticed that this reasons a stronger isn't it kind

1121
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,110
of implies uris

1122
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:25,570
right so let's get some definitions down here

1123
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,760
can find it here

1124
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:30,030
rather than

1125
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,750
we say

1126
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:40,550
my strategy

1127
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,690
how far

1128
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:47,350
strictly dominates

1129
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:51,920
strictly dominates

1130
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:56,330
my strategy bees and

1131
01:11:56,430 --> 01:12:02,050
if my payoff

1132
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:05,690
from alpha

1133
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:15,580
than that

1134
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,010
from these

1135
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:20,480
this is a key part of the definition

1136
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,200
of what

1137
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,630
regardless of what others to read that back

1138
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:39,700
we say the my strategy alpha correctly dominates my strategy set my payoff from alpha

1139
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,840
is strictly

1140
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:45,680
greater than that can be regardless of what others do

1141
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:49,940
now it's by no means my main aim in this past to teach you dog

1142
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:53,670
right a few bits of jargon to be helpful in allowing the conversation to move

1143
01:12:53,670 --> 01:13:01,770
forward and this is certainly one evil gets is maybe one with the system

1144
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:05,840
structured lessons from this actually so it's a good story that we bring down here

1145
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,580
on this board

1146
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:15,770
so the first lesson of the classes lots of lessons

1147
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:18,940
is lesson that emerges immediately from the definition

1148
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,160
the dominant of the dominant strategy

1149
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:26,210
and it's this

1150
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:29,650
lesson one of the course is

1151
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:43,420
dominate said

1152
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:52,870
right so i with apologies to strunk and white this is the passive form dominate

1153
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:55,870
passive voice do not play

1154
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:57,590
is strictly dominated

1155
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,210
so it otherwise why

1156
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,000
i'm going to get this guy not

1157
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:09,410
his right

1158
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,550
it is

1159
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,500
the dominant

1160
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:17,200
come on everyone would result

1161
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,790
like were should

1162
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:22,600
it's possible also looking for something more direct is

1163
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:26,860
we look the definition is dominant strategy saying never play one

1164
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,350
the possible reason for that is that can we get the woman

1165
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:35,640
i always knew well was about winning and losing

1166
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:40,460
what else can we have we can get this this kind of thing

1167
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:42,050
the payoffs alone

1168
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,170
the payoffs alone OK so

1169
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:47,890
so here's here's an abbreviated version of that but that's not the

1170
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:53,110
that's precisely longer the reason i don't want to play strictly dominated strategy

1171
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,170
it is but it if instead

1172
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:57,830
i play the strategy that dominates states

1173
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:00,120
i do better in every case

1174
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:05,190
reason never want to play strictly dominated strategy is if instead i by the strategy

1175
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:11,630
that dominates it whatever anyone else does i'm doing but i would

1176
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:16,560
that's a pretty convincing argument that sounds convincing arguments it sounds like two obvious even

1177
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,800
to what we were thinking in class

1178
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:23,890
right so let me try and shake your face about in this in this answer

1179
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,900
somebody wanted by the FBI

1180
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,110
how about the following on

1181
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,860
the payoff matrix again

1182
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,850
and i suppose the reason as follows

1183
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:40,520
suppose i reason and say

1184
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:42,680
if we if we knew my

1185
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,280
both reason this way and choose alpha

1186
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:47,070
we'll both get zero

1187
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:50,360
but if we both reasons a different way and should be

1188
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,830
they were both get one

1189
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:56,060
so i should use beta one begins are i use

1190
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,040
what's wrong with that argument

1191
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:02,780
now i must be wrong because it's less the past lessons the plaza got the

1192
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:07,380
wrong ever so what's wrong with that are from that

1193
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:11,350
this guy just as good

1194
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:21,520
right so involve some notion of agreeing about national agreeing so certainly part of the

1195
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,590
problem here

1196
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:26,070
with the reason i just gave me the reason that said i should choose beta

1197
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:28,860
because we both reason the same way both by the way

1198
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:33,730
it involves some kind of magical reasoning it's as if i'm arguing that i e

1199
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:38,060
reason this way and reason myself to choose some i'm going to make the rest

1200
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:38,860
of you

1201
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:40,360
the reason the same way too

1202
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:43,660
it's like i've got yes prr i'm some character out of

1203
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:48,980
what is all the x-men that was called right now in fact becomes priced you

1204
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,850
i'm not i don't have ISBN to be another character of the x-men so you

1205
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:52,520
so this is now

1206
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:54,000
the desk

1207
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:58,850
desktop so each one of the coloured regions was one seperate depth map

1208
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,630
and then we can glue them all into a in reconstruction the whole scene

1209
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:05,460
these are just some different

1210
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:09,040
renderings these so that we can texture map it

1211
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:13,040
this is a normal map which gives you a good indication of whether you've got

1212
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:16,130
accurate reconstruction and the smooth surfaces

1213
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:19,670
a fun thing

1214
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:22,600
we can do with this is to revisit the yeah

1215
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:25,480
augmented reality and

1216
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:28,730
but now

1217
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:32,520
with our new level of capability because we don't just know where the camera is

1218
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,650
now we know what's in the same so we have a full model of this

1219
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:36,400
desktop scene

1220
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,170
so now when we drop this virtual currencies seen the queen cars

1221
01:17:40,710 --> 01:17:41,290
is virtual

1222
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:44,630
you can see for instance we can make it disappear behind a real

1223
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:46,810
cup because we've got a model of the cup

1224
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:48,900
we know that the cup should include the car

1225
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,830
the other thing we can do is actually make it physically interact with the same

1226
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:54,330
so we can

1227
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:56,420
make ramps out over

1228
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,440
the stuff that we find in the same

1229
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:04,940
so this is just by loading the mesh that we generated into free um

1230
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,350
physics simulator

1231
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:09,810
and then make the car drive around on on the surface

1232
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:12,940
so there was

1233
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,150
that's system we could live don't reconstruction

1234
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:18,670
and there was

1235
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:22,540
you know big big advance at the time but that's still didn't fully

1236
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:25,630
satisfy us because we are pretty much still riding

1237
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:27,900
the point-based system

1238
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:29,230
and then using

1239
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:33,620
optical flow on top about we wanted a slam system that was kind of dense

1240
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:38,560
but a place where there is relevant to this

1241
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,120
pacitti student in my lab steve lovegrove that the time was

1242
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:44,250
he boater

1243
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:46,480
aslam system four

1244
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,940
mosaicing so this is if you like

1245
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,690
so panoramic mosaicing is a type of simple

1246
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:54,360
slam problem where

1247
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,940
you want to estimate the three d e rotation over the camera so it's three degrees of freedom

1248
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:03,230
it's only rotating it's not translating

1249
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,850
and you want to build a map and the map is basically

1250
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:09,980
the panorama so there's no depth about markets just lies on the sphere

1251
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:15,710
but he did this by our whole image alignment approach so there's no features in this

1252
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:16,940
system at all

1253
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:20,100
what he's doing is he's building a map of the

1254
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,130
the panorama but basically laying down keyframes

1255
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:25,560
the relative

1256
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,900
oppose the camera all times it is found by

1257
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:34,600
taking the live image and doing a whole image alignment using a whole image looks cannot type methods

1258
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,230
the find out what's the

1259
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:39,600
transform of this live image that brings it into the best

1260
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:44,650
alignment with with the map that i've got where alignment is measured by

1261
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:47,850
you know some squared differences over all overlapping

1262
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:52,130
it depends on the cheapy course it's very fast

1263
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:56,900
there's a pyramid implementation so it goes from low resolution the high resolution that makes it

1264
01:19:57,730 --> 01:19:59,420
faster and more robust still

1265
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:03,190
and so he was able to attract really quite fast

1266
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:04,810
motion against this

1267
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:12,150
obviously we can combine those last two things pretty much so

1268
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:15,290
once we've been able to build a dam surface

1269
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:18,040
model of of this desktop type scene

1270
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:20,190
why not then turn off

1271
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:25,190
the point baseline system altogether and just about track the position of the camera

1272
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:27,460
by real time alignment

1273
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:31,040
of the images that i'm getting for the camera against the model and we've got

1274
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,310
a textured model of the world

1275
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:34,900
i need to know where the camera is so what i need to do is

1276
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,770
find the projection of the texture model

1277
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,850
agrees as well as possible

1278
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,130
with my new

1279
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:41,330
live image

1280
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:44,860
and it's not we don't have to solve them from scratch all the time because

1281
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:48,880
we knew where the cameras and the last frames so it's basically a lucas kanade

1282
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,080
optimization still

1283
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,630
but now in six-degrees-of-freedom

1284
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:55,350
other than three

1285
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:59,380
so we also made some improvements on the actual reconstruction

1286
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:02,210
part so in this paper that we call detail

1287
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,190
which is really released

1288
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:05,270
i to

1289
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,920
last year we now not using

1290
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,290
the graz optical flow library anymore we have our own

1291
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,290
variational u

1292
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:19,000
solver for depth maps which is directly solving for depth maps rather than

1293
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:19,980
trying to

1294
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:23,940
you know fit optical flow into depth map estimation

1295
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:29,400
but then we now doing tracking the camera against this

1296
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:30,900
holden's dense model

1297
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:33,920
so here's an example so here festival which is showing

1298
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,190
building a model of the scene

1299
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:38,380
so it's building several depthmaps

1300
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:41,270
basically just sticking those depthmaps

1301
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,730
next to each other

1302
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,420
to make a reconstruction and the whole scene

1303
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:50,770
so you can see this is you know the speed that actually

1304
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,250
runs out you can see how fast it's able to build the reconstruction

1305
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56,790
and now we can show how how tracking works

1306
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,460
this is a kind of per pixel

1307
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:01,480
demonstration of

1308
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,270
so so we were optimizing for the position of the camera

1309
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:08,810
by minimizing the difference between

1310
01:22:09,730 --> 01:22:10,670
the re-projected model

1311
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:12,040
and the live image

1312
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:17,790
there's a gating built into that's as well so if the difference is too big

1313
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:22,850
add any particular pixel we throw pixel it's not used in your optimization so that's

1314
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,100
what the yellow areas are

1315
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,350
here the regions been gated out so for instance if there's something including

1316
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:32,190
and now he we have a head-to-head comparison of the quality of tracking

1317
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:36,150
we can now get soapy term on the right the points-based system which is actually

1318
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:38,620
very very good software very very highly optimized

1319
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:42,060
and now we can test if a really really fast motion

1320
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,480
the quality of tracking is displayed by this

1321
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:47,600
augmented car

1322
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:49,690
but the tracking is good it should stay

1323
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,290
in the same place

1324
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:54,040
the tracking is not so good you should see it

1325
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:57,810
what around so we can cope with rapid motion shaking

1326
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,710
and even more remarkably we can

1327
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,770
just just for the hell of it we try defocusing

1328
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:04,020
the camera here

1329
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:08,880
so all of the point features that peter using get wiped out but i don't know it still

1330
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:10,830
tracking pretty well because

1331
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,860
you know that's methods which is just subtracting all the images in the pixels in an image

1332
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,600
i can still give you something pretty sensible at

1333
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:22,310
and the essentially the asian situation that you have

1334
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:28,300
first order interaction second order interaction fair order interactions and so on and if you

1335
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:31,500
is not modelling the right

1336
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:34,930
interaction order you are incorporating minds

1337
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:41,300
and so in this framework in a decision tree interactions into the model

1338
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:45,100
through the path from the root to a terminal

1339
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:50,050
so if you have j terminal node tree you come interactions orders

1340
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:52,900
interactions of order up to JIS

1341
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,260
so by

1342
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:58,840
building and symbols of trees where you can control

1343
01:23:58,850 --> 01:24:04,580
j you can control the interaction order if you're approximation and that becomes another case

1344
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:06,430
what is problem dependent

1345
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,710
and so on

1346
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:15,130
i'm going to speak to that

1347
01:24:18,730 --> 01:24:21,260
jenni murray and i think this is the

1348
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:26,040
this is going to final slide here a gradient most in slash marks

1349
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:32,140
a again when that those papers were that of worth reading was not choosing the

1350
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:35,010
coefficients in a separate step

1351
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:41,170
and so then what the recipe where we're calling it the importance sampling recipe which

1352
01:24:41,170 --> 01:24:47,260
calls for this step was not being user however boosting is still understood as an

1353
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:55,350
incremental forward stagewise regression procedure with lasso penalty with this shrinkage controlled by absolute so

1354
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:56,840
not dissimilarity

1355
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:59,840
between the four starting regulation that we saw

1356
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:01,320
a few slides back

1357
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:06,180
as an approximation to the last so and the forward stagewise algorithm by which we

1358
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:09,420
then simple here

1359
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,720
and so

1360
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:17,580
this is a comparison so the this this is what we had before so bagging

1361
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:22,250
random forests on on the same hundred

1362
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:27,080
problems and improvements and so here we are at

1363
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:29,010
what i call

1364
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,710
so we have marked

1365
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:31,760
so much

1366
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:36,130
we call them sequentially so because it is in the sequential approximation

1367
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:40,550
that's that's what they secured stands for the sequential approximation where

1368
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:43,510
and and so on

1369
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:49,230
this is so marked is equivalent to using the sequential approximation with absolute equal to

1370
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:55,210
point one and it i equal to fifty percent

1371
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:58,800
so i

1372
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:03,140
i guess this p should be there if i'm correct

1373
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:09,260
because mark that's in the post processing and there's this uses the same the same

1374
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:14,540
as smaller gaps along but i

1375
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:22,720
but few data so this these two parameters has a one increases the diversity so

1376
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,350
you have to control it by

1377
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:29,810
for using the what we've both processes that we call this symbols back in the

1378
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:34,600
forties and this iterative parallel again because since each day doesn't depend on the others

1379
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:38,900
you can go on but i said but we call this equation once again so

1380
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:40,100
you cannot take

1381
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:43,880
each tree depends on what you don't have to appoint so

1382
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:47,590
this equation while so this is an i

1383
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:54,680
seems to outperform the parallel ones and this is consistent with response in a monte

1384
01:26:54,680 --> 01:27:00,860
carlo integration where you the group importance as opposed to the single point important

1385
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:04,250
what do we do now

1386
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:08,180
finally to begin

1387
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:11,000
if we look

1388
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:13,090
if we look at this

1389
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:16,170
previously this is truly extraordinary

1390
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:20,040
you see the improve the news

1391
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:22,140
further generalisations of

1392
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:23,840
the ensemble idea

1393
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:26,820
it is similar to the improvement you

1394
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:28,480
from the single

1395
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:29,460
to the

1396
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:33,220
using ensembles in the first place so if you

1397
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:36,760
remember we're hitting the hitting wall here with how well

1398
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:37,850
we can do

1399
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:41,420
with various types of sampling and now there's a further breakthrough

1400
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:45,300
so this is really exciting time

1401
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:48,920
so i'm going to do a little bit about rule ensembles but

1402
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,600
for the sake of those of us who think visually i want to show a

1403
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,520
little bit from

1404
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,460
the appendix first

1405
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,090
o holy

1406
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:01,770
boosting idea

1407
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,350
i remember one of the ways that we

1408
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:08,360
it's going to look at

1409
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:17,790
one of the was six

1410
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:26,610
and exploit that

1411
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:29,300
let's look at an example

1412
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:34,390
the simple problem that shows the

1413
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:37,180
now it was talking to

1414
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:43,380
july ran through the

1415
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:49,220
versus the template things are very valuable thing to do

1416
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:54,630
but let's give a little bit of detail back again to the algorithm will visualization

1417
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:58,720
because we're very different things here one of which is the weights we ignore some

1418
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:02,210
cases are double some cases and others the algorithm will either

1419
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,710
don't look at all the variables

1420
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:08,230
or look at all the variables and then

1421
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:12,300
and the loss function and so forth but one of the ways to very weights

1422
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:16,080
in a real way rather than individual way as you do with it

1423
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:21,840
with bootstrapping the although the case where role integers but you could very them according

1424
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:27,340
to performance which cases you need to do better and so the idea of boosting

1425
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:31,850
mister here's two class problem or trying to estimate is a versus non eg if

1426
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:34,040
you will is trees which are

1427
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:37,760
poorly suited to curb curving decision boundaries

1428
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:42,670
so if it data with the tree and we get the best sort of to

1429
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:48,840
sketch approximation they can give a certain amount of complexity for the two classes

1430
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:53,890
well the idea there is to know which cases are causing this problem will start

1431
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:58,010
banging first of all we take a subset of the state and for more trees

1432
01:29:58,010 --> 01:30:03,180
have average them together so near one hundred trees averaged together you get

1433
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:09,010
this blurred boundaries the white part is the part of the trees disagree new so

1434
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:10,850
the threshold would draw

1435
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:13,360
the more complex square around there

1436
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:18,360
on the other hand

1437
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:24,610
fits street to the data and then weights the cases that are causing the problem

1438
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:29,810
so the cases that are on the boundaries they're misclassified gives more weight especially if

1439
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:36,100
rare amongst those that are misclassified as opposed and down weights

1440
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:38,690
the case you're getting correct

1441
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:41,650
and then it seems that all

1442
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:46,100
one page and not even one page that on large variance terminal but one page

1443
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:50,210
it's on this tiny little projector screen this is the whole thing

1444
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:56,590
actually the little bit i had utility file that has this

1445
01:30:56,650 --> 01:30:59,670
you some utility for about basic probability

1446
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:01,980
this is the way to split up

1447
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:07,010
the segmentation into all possible splits the probability of the word is just a sequence

1448
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:12,850
of words just the product of the individual words probabilities and segmentation is just repeating

1449
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:17,220
this recursive idea of the best segmentation and then you realize it

1450
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:20,080
to get the dynamic programming

1451
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:22,250
so very simple approach

1452
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:23,530
how well does it do

1453
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:28,480
what happened at one point seven billion words hanging around on my laptop was trying

1454
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:32,400
to do this seriously ever taken from a larger corpus

1455
01:31:32,410 --> 01:31:34,770
but one point seven billion was fine

1456
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:40,760
and i actually the test case for myself like ninety eight percent word accuracy there

1457
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:41,780
are some errors

1458
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:45,380
this one can you guys segment that

1459
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:48,740
well i got

1460
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:53,150
base rate sought to initiative in base rate sought so both pretty good

1461
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:56,170
segmentations i have choose the wrong one

1462
01:31:56,230 --> 01:31:58,990
this one

1463
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,110
i got small and in

1464
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:06,320
significant when it should have been small and insignificant so this is the case where

1465
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,190
knowing some semantics would have helped or

1466
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:14,170
just knowing some probabilities over multiple word sequences rather than just one word at a

1467
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:17,880
here's another one this one's harder

1468
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:21,800
news segment that

1469
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:24,900
i got g in or mouse go

1470
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:28,490
but it should have been generously go so this was an example where i want

1471
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:33,150
to have an out of vocabulary words out of all one point seven billion words

1472
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:35,410
i'd never seen j enormous before

1473
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:41,240
and that's kind of the hard part is making these models for what to do

1474
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,860
to smooth when you haven't seen words before

1475
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:47,880
my trivial program didn't do a good job of smoothing so

1476
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:50,520
we got the right

1477
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:57,260
and this stuff really matters so obviously matters in chinese and other languages like that

1478
01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:03,330
we wanted segmentation right on the web there's also segmentation problems people type in queries

1479
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:06,650
and they get them wrong they leave out spaces they put an extra spaces and

1480
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:11,610
we want to fix it for them and of course people right URL's without spaces

1481
01:33:11,610 --> 01:33:12,320
in them

1482
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:15,040
and we want to recognise that get them right

1483
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:20,940
and people have made mistakes both in recognizing these and i claim that webmasters have

1484
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:26,480
made mistakes in the URL the register and so i applied my algorithm two

1485
01:33:26,490 --> 01:33:29,540
some of these possible URL's

1486
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:30,690
here's one

1487
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:36,540
so that's the course who represents great site where you can see which hollywood stars

1488
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:41,230
are represented by which agents and of course that was the only possible

1489
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:43,990
segmentation right there

1490
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:52,480
released that's the best segmentation algorithm who would have thought of another possible segmentation

1491
01:33:52,530 --> 01:33:59,170
here's a therapist finder you can find somebody for therapeutic all means

1492
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:06,400
nobody could have segments that ran theories expertsexchange

1493
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:09,610
where you can hire an expert

1494
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:13,000
and not get any kind of medical advice

1495
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:15,100
i used want go wrong

1496
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:20,610
ten ireland purveyor of fine writing implements

1497
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:27,680
my little test test bed tormented air their expected ten i but i actually got

1498
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:29,740
was cut off

1499
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:35,320
should i don't know what i actually got but it's it's obviously i got something

1500
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:40,330
that has a which contains the word with high probability among about one point seven

1501
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:43,350
billion record

1502
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:45,930
and one more example

1503
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:50,030
purveyor of fine art art supplies

1504
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:54,830
the predictions would be that if these are on different chromosomes he would get twenty

1505
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:57,900
five percent twenty five percent

1506
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:01,510
twenty five percent twenty five percent

1507
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:06,460
if they're on the same chromosome under very simple interpretation of the chromosomal theory of

1508
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:09,830
inheritance he would get fifty fifty fifty zero zero

1509
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:13,060
and in fact what you get

1510
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:16,800
nine hundred sixty five

1511
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:18,680
nine hundred forty four

1512
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:21,000
two hundred six

1513
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:24,940
and one hundred eighty five

1514
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:28,500
what do you make

1515
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:32,420
which which theory is confirmed

1516
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:43,400
maybe this is just the statistical fluctuation around the first line

1517
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:44,410
i don't think so

1518
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:45,150
how come

1519
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:50,500
one way to while but these are wild type so maybe

1520
01:35:51,670 --> 01:35:55,750
what do you think those numbers too far off quarter quarter quarter be believable

1521
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,900
much relation between us

1522
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:00,230
i mean

1523
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,990
not only are they are the way of quarter quarter quarter quartered something is fishy

1524
01:36:04,290 --> 01:36:08,060
the two parental types are much higher than the two non parental types

1525
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,730
that saying something to you

1526
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:15,260
interesting what about this other one fifty fifty zero zero can this be fluctuation one

1527
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:20,790
now this one is really pretty easy to reject because zero this is not like

1528
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,690
close to zero there should be zero shouldn't see any of those right because they

1529
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:27,500
go and if they are on the same chromosome so when you were acting like

1530
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:31,000
mendel good we're seeing something funny in the data here you even see saw something

1531
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,340
that is beyond just it's a little weird but it's actually a little weird some

1532
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:37,150
interesting direction

1533
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:42,050
how many of them are the parental type

1534
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:46,000
that's my sixty five assigned forty four how many of the non frontal type

1535
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:50,440
nice to o six plus one eighty five so let's figure out what the proportion

1536
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:51,730
the frequency

1537
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:54,790
of non parental types

1538
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:05,610
well it's r two o six

1539
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:07,530
close one eighty five

1540
01:37:07,550 --> 01:37:14,410
over two o six plus one eighty five plus nine sixty five

1541
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:16,760
plus nine forty four

1542
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:20,120
which is

1543
01:37:20,150 --> 01:37:24,170
seventeen percent

1544
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:27,270
OK so seventeen percent

1545
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:30,300
we now know what the answer is

1546
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:32,480
when you take two traits

1547
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:38,840
and you cross them in this fashion two recessive traits do it just cross

1548
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:42,300
the racial neither be accorded quartet quarter or

1549
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:45,850
it's not going to be one and a half i have zero zero

1550
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,100
in fact

1551
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:51,790
it will always be seventeen percent

1552
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:55,190
what went out

1553
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:58,370
i the look is data set three to one it's trying to say three to

1554
01:37:58,370 --> 01:38:05,640
one is trying to say seventeen percent

1555
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:06,840
how well

1556
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:09,830
so that's the thing is is what to make of this number what is the

1557
01:38:09,830 --> 01:38:11,230
seventeen percent me

1558
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:12,680
that was she well known

1559
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:14,680
but this is genetic recombination

1560
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:15,710
right you know

1561
01:38:15,730 --> 01:38:20,010
these chromosomes are strange material i can kid about that but i put yourself in

1562
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:23,250
the days of thomas hunt morgan looking at these data trying to figure out what

1563
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:25,210
is the seventeen percent trying to tell

1564
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:30,040
there were people around colombia and elsewhere who were saying all the seventeen percent number

1565
01:38:30,050 --> 01:38:35,150
says a lot about physiology to statement about the rule developmental relationship of genes and

1566
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:38,560
were trying to read all sorts of things into these numbers and the first thing

1567
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,750
is that test more pairs of traits

1568
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,200
how about another pair

1569
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:45,910
you do that you get seventeen percent

1570
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:48,650
now it is that get a person to do it with another pair maybe at

1571
01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:49,770
nine percent

1572
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:53,140
so it's not a constant we can reject the idea of seventeen percent is some

1573
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:58,140
constant like e or whatever pir something like that but we

1574
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:01,320
we look at these numbers and a lot of folks wanted to interpret these is

1575
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:06,450
it was something about the biology

1576
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,840
of these traits

1577
01:39:08,930 --> 01:39:12,490
so are

1578
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:21,920
i think we get this thing named the frequency of non parental types we can

1579
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:26,260
call this the recombination rate because we got new combinations

1580
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:33,180
i this recombination rate might mean and i and you know already that you're thinking

1581
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:36,080
what it really means is

1582
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:51,290
we have black

1583
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:56,370
and the f one

1584
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:57,200
we have

1585
01:39:57,210 --> 01:39:58,470
this stage all

1586
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,550
this the job

1587
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:05,680
and that somehow

1588
01:40:05,690 --> 01:40:10,530
these two chromosomes have exchanged genetic material

1589
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:13,640
so that the new chromosome you'd get

1590
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:19,170
is like this and you get combatant type

1591
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:22,050
you get recombination between these crimes

1592
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:27,550
and there's recombination rate

1593
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:34,450
and the recombination rate is how often this kind of exchange occurs

1594
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:40,710
and what the recombination rate depend on

1595
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:43,690
the distance between those two genes

1596
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:48,050
you know this because you've been told this since kindergarten right to know all the

1597
01:40:48,050 --> 01:40:52,250
high school textbooks and things like that are summed or whenever they start they teach

1598
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:56,810
genetics earlier earlier these days so it any edits in it's on TV and stuff

1599
01:40:58,210 --> 01:41:02,970
that's a nice idea that the recombination rate depends on the distance and this rate

1600
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:06,210
which might be seventeen percent or it might be one percent or it might be

1601
01:41:06,210 --> 01:41:12,220
a centre knows what depends on the distance is a reflection of the distance

1602
01:41:12,230 --> 01:41:17,160
golly what's the evidence for that

1603
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:21,250
are we just making up the theory to explain the data here

1604
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:24,740
we don't have a theory to we were just trying to fix the chromosomal theory

1605
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:28,710
chromosomal theory would predict these are common types it would have predicted we only get

1606
01:41:28,710 --> 01:41:33,820
parental types out so because we do get pregnant parental types that we say well

1607
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,890
chromosomes are promiscuous and the parts

1608
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:39,000
because we don't always get the same ratio

1609
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:42,260
we have to make up the fact that somehow

1610
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:46,190
the ratio is different because of something distance

1611
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:50,050
we can observe this is no way that morgan was able look at the chromosome

1612
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:52,520
and see where the genes one so

1613
01:41:52,610 --> 01:41:55,800
basically any number you want to give up

1614
01:41:55,850 --> 01:41:59,360
just say it's the distance

1615
01:41:59,370 --> 01:42:01,220
this is not overwhelming

1616
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:07,250
that's what even the evidence to chromosomes exchange material

1617
01:42:07,290 --> 01:42:10,680
why do what we think stuff like that happens

1618
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:13,320
turns out you can take

1619
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:17,910
fruit fly again meets another things and look at the microscope what you do is

1620
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:23,020
to look at them closely the chromosomes during meiosis you put covers labotomy squashing down

1621
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:24,770
a little dying you look

1622
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:27,520
and it turns out that really truly

1623
01:42:27,570 --> 01:42:29,930
when you look in the microscope

1624
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:35,260
you can see stuff like that

1625
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:38,270
of chromosomes lying on top of each other i

1626
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:41,850
these are called high as marked

1627
01:42:43,670 --> 01:42:48,570
hi as much or the world kind smart

1628
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:55,180
you can see microsoft so does that convincingly demonstrates recombination occurs

1629
01:42:55,180 --> 01:43:00,970
obviously a there is difference

1630
01:43:00,970 --> 01:43:02,310
many years ago

1631
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:14,250
this yes of problems

1632
01:43:16,930 --> 01:43:18,680
and that is

1633
01:43:22,590 --> 01:43:24,680
two things one

1634
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:27,630
but i like to start with a little puzzle

1635
01:43:27,630 --> 01:43:30,270
so the interface

1636
01:43:30,490 --> 01:43:34,060
we lose contact have something to do with this

1637
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:38,910
just came with me

1638
01:43:38,910 --> 01:43:42,580
i believe that this part of the and this is actually a problem that's a

1639
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:44,810
thousand years old i guess

1640
01:43:44,830 --> 01:43:47,400
well exactly to do the

1641
01:43:47,410 --> 01:43:51,760
sometimes in nineteen within the monthly as an element we call them

1642
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,770
and a problem with stick

1643
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:57,150
it's one hundred something as well

1644
01:43:57,450 --> 01:43:59,020
and smartmoney

1645
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:01,150
they placed randomly

1646
01:44:01,150 --> 01:44:04,020
they are signed to action and they start moving

1647
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:05,990
when they reach the end of this state

1648
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:10,770
the question is

1649
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:14,270
moving the weight of a one

1650
01:44:14,410 --> 01:44:16,910
a set per sec

1651
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:19,290
how long will it take them to the

1652
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:22,760
this is a very old it's a very simple answer

1653
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:26,100
some the answer is obvious by the way for

1654
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:28,960
you the answer right away and the answer to my hundred

1655
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:35,010
and reason is very simple thing about it is the ants are in race

1656
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:40,070
in each one of them holding the stick and went to meet they just change

1657
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:41,070
it back

1658
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:44,210
that means that the battens always moving the same direction

1659
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:47,120
and they move the rate of oxygen per second

1660
01:44:47,130 --> 01:44:48,180
and all

1661
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:53,380
one hundred second all of the time in the hundred and one is just

1662
01:44:53,410 --> 01:44:54,960
is not significant the

1663
01:44:55,090 --> 01:45:00,980
OK so i came up with an alternative form

1664
01:45:00,990 --> 01:45:03,800
and i call it this

1665
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:08,800
on the seventh of is as follows we come from the pacific northwest with the

1666
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,960
seminole warriors they get

1667
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:16,770
born in distance between the go you'd sort of the ocean and then back to

1668
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:19,150
the later they were born the

1669
01:45:19,170 --> 01:45:24,460
so i came up with this level of and like this suggestion of the

1670
01:45:24,490 --> 01:45:28,900
and here is the same thing you start with the bottom sediments

1671
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:32,020
at their first place and they start moving in

1672
01:45:32,050 --> 01:45:34,810
and random direction at a constant

1673
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:38,580
when they told me they change direction

1674
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:43,110
and windows seven returns to its eyes were just these guys

1675
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:47,060
so it was clear examples

1676
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:53,810
the city of

1677
01:45:53,830 --> 01:45:56,710
the the question is actually two questions

1678
01:45:56,710 --> 01:45:58,400
made by way

1679
01:45:58,420 --> 01:45:59,710
the label

1680
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:01,110
and really is

1681
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:04,990
is it true that always the second in the design and are in they will

1682
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,710
tell us what will be the last survivor

1683
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:09,370
just one

1684
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:12,770
if two of them collide birthplace of one of them

1685
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:15,030
then that takes precedence

1686
01:46:15,090 --> 01:46:16,940
so by comes from

1687
01:46:26,190 --> 01:46:29,210
OK i know i want

1688
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:30,560
and you go on to the

1689
01:46:59,210 --> 01:47:04,220
OK thank you for the invitation with the opportunity to to come to the city

1690
01:47:04,220 --> 01:47:06,020
i like first of all

1691
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:09,370
express want to dedicate longer going well my

1692
01:47:10,270 --> 01:47:12,630
meant for source of inspiration

1693
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:13,830
in france

1694
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:22,010
this switch on the basis of terms what this

1695
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:26,480
question why some problems become popular in

1696
01:47:26,530 --> 01:47:33,800
why other problems like the one on the shelf nobody touches them

1697
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:37,780
and i will provide sample of fundamental problems

1698
01:47:37,810 --> 01:47:43,880
eventually you will get a good definition what the mean environmental problems

1699
01:47:43,890 --> 01:47:45,490
and here is

1700
01:47:45,490 --> 01:47:47,230
several of them

1701
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:49,980
the first one is the obvious distance well

1702
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:54,180
the second i call it a white newspaper chopsticks

1703
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:56,870
we can actually hope to recover something

1704
01:47:57,030 --> 01:47:59,810
that's in the network OK

1705
01:47:59,860 --> 01:48:00,770
the phase

1706
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:02,180
maybe rather small

1707
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,130
depending on the network and all

1708
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:05,110
speak about

1709
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:07,820
how this transition point here moves

1710
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:11,330
possibly to the left of the properties of the network changed

1711
01:48:11,350 --> 01:48:13,890
OK in opera enough ask

1712
01:48:14,210 --> 01:48:17,800
what is the computer during OK so

1713
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:21,380
what we have this transition and

1714
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:23,350
we tried to pose this problem

1715
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:24,660
so that it would be

1716
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:26,830
independent of any algorithms

1717
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:30,540
that's why we say OK we have equal sized groups

1718
01:48:31,730 --> 01:48:37,650
the the the whole thing is parameterized only by essentially the probability that links lie

1719
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:40,610
between groups versus light within

1720
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:46,980
well they could before that before they could be five

1721
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:47,840
pardon me

1722
01:48:47,940 --> 01:49:02,810
that that's that's very true i show an example of forward support

1723
01:49:02,830 --> 01:49:03,950
to make its

1724
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:05,760
independent of an algorithm

1725
01:49:05,770 --> 01:49:07,810
we said OK what we give to the to

1726
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:09,400
their potential

1727
01:49:09,410 --> 01:49:11,950
computer is we give the number of

1728
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:15,550
we give their respective sizes so

1729
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,760
we have to find essentially a partition

1730
01:49:17,770 --> 01:49:21,270
it corresponds to what you already know is in the network but we don't tell

1731
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:23,140
you the parameters of the partition

1732
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:27,140
so we don't tell you what's the probability for link to be inside or to

1733
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:30,100
the outside but everything else you're given

1734
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:34,080
and what it does is it transforms the problem of

1735
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:38,610
well you'll find clustering problem into well-defined partitioning problem

1736
01:49:38,630 --> 01:49:42,310
because i tell you what is the size of the partition

1737
01:49:42,710 --> 01:49:47,040
and you're supposed and the only strategy that you can now have is to look

1738
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,680
for maximally separated clusters right

1739
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:53,010
i give you the network to tell you

1740
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:56,450
the sizes of the partitions and the only thing you can sensibly do is

1741
01:49:56,470 --> 01:50:00,390
try to find the partition that minimizes the number of links

1742
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,650
run between the different parts

1743
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:04,570
as if you want to do that

1744
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:06,970
you would miss the trivial cases

1745
01:50:10,190 --> 01:50:12,550
then what you optimize is

1746
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:16,000
this cost function here it's very easy to understand

1747
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:18,830
you go over all the links

1748
01:50:19,690 --> 01:50:20,710
you signed

1749
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:26,000
of inference now sigma i to each other

1750
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:31,160
and when the link runs between two nodes which are in the same

1751
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:35,230
in the same group that gives you

1752
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:38,230
one of the two

1753
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:40,610
but this is zero when you account

1754
01:50:40,650 --> 01:50:45,310
the sorry should have probably minus one here

1755
01:50:49,140 --> 01:50:53,000
what you do is you can all the adjusted rand between nodes in different groups

1756
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:53,580
right so

1757
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:56,500
this is the cutsize as it threatened sure

1758
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:58,820
and you try to minimize that

1759
01:50:58,870 --> 01:51:03,130
and the way to minimize it you change the labels assign to the no

1760
01:51:03,150 --> 01:51:05,670
change inference there

1761
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:07,800
so how many possibilities you have

1762
01:51:07,810 --> 01:51:10,460
to assign inference one principle

1763
01:51:10,470 --> 01:51:13,810
you have to search among all the

1764
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:14,980
and over two

1765
01:51:17,340 --> 01:51:20,800
possible assignments into two equal sized groups for or

1766
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:22,290
trivial case here

1767
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:26,960
and if you find the minimum of that then this is probably a bayesian

1768
01:51:27,010 --> 01:51:30,570
maximum aposteriori optimal estimator

1769
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:33,490
we you should know is that

1770
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:36,000
for a given p in

1771
01:51:36,050 --> 01:51:39,080
the eyes that you know

1772
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:46,820
linearly dependent on this incipient is one then you cats zero and in is one

1773
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:52,360
cutsize is just one quarter of all the edges essentially

1774
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:58,290
so this is the problem is defined

1775
01:51:58,350 --> 01:52:01,460
the nice thing is that statistical mechanics allows us

1776
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:03,670
to give expectation values

1777
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:08,150
one these quantities here for the cutsize has for this ensemble of networks and we

1778
01:52:08,150 --> 01:52:09,370
have defined

1779
01:52:10,830 --> 01:52:11,980
about that

1780
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,360
we actually able

1781
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:14,850
to calculate

1782
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:19,920
the probability that a given that particular node has

1783
01:52:19,970 --> 01:52:23,260
assign labels to design custom made

1784
01:52:24,270 --> 01:52:26,840
what is the probability that we will theory

1785
01:52:26,850 --> 01:52:28,890
in group sigma

1786
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:31,330
so essentially

1787
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:34,240
well we study is what is the overlap

1788
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:38,140
of the configuration the assignment of labels

1789
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:39,990
that minimizes the cat's eyes

1790
01:52:41,070 --> 01:52:42,710
the assignment

1791
01:52:42,730 --> 01:52:46,480
of pre assigncluster so we put in place

1792
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:50,760
in statistical mechanics allows us to do that rigorously

1793
01:52:50,850 --> 01:52:55,270
and then the accuracy show plots

1794
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:56,590
there's nothing more

1795
01:52:56,610 --> 01:53:00,940
then the sum over correctly assign notes

1796
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:04,690
so you just go over all those and ask what

1797
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:06,620
just count how many get

1798
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:12,200
is that

1799
01:53:14,620 --> 01:53:16,770
but that's OK

1800
01:53:17,150 --> 01:53:18,360
now i

1801
01:53:18,410 --> 01:53:21,150
why do we have this kind of transition

1802
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:22,850
and the reason

1803
01:53:22,890 --> 01:53:27,070
is to be solved in this picture here what this shows is

1804
01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:33,410
a cartoon image so to say of the landscape of cutsizes versus configurations

1805
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:35,470
so here you have to imagine

1806
01:53:35,490 --> 01:53:36,370
all the

1807
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:43,210
and half the and possible assignments of inferred labels

1808
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:44,980
and they all the outside

1809
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:49,880
and then one of these configurations in particular the one year

1810
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:54,610
that's our designed configuration is like the true things that we want to infer

1811
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:57,550
if we're down here

1812
01:53:57,550 --> 01:54:03,100
is not completely stupid is not completely we baseline it just doesn't quite know

1813
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:08,980
how to analyse the which is what the demonstration tells you that there is

1814
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:14,420
i see it works as well so we so as in we

1815
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:19,270
we were i mean for about a month physico you know try to hand to

1816
01:54:19,290 --> 01:54:24,160
what functions and that actually does not work and it was afterwards i had to

1817
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:27,610
for a long time it actually didn't work so a couple of albums and that

1818
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:33,650
actually was what made the difference we were not able to figure what function

1819
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:36,240
so that all the

1820
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:39,950
reward function was which trust the vote

1821
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:43,730
the dynamics of the expression problem

1822
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:53,520
politics for right i think you know a state-of-the-art on it's city the theoretical answer

1823
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:58,110
to how to do exploration in reinforcement learning is given by the two thousand as

1824
01:54:58,110 --> 01:55:02,560
well as many other theories like dr max algorithm shankar they don't have their own

1825
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:06,050
variations of number of people worked on the follower

1826
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:11,120
but how peaceful the theorem eight theoretical answer given by humans the following

1827
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:14,280
let's have the a whole culture and i want to build a good dynamical model

1828
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:15,900
from helicopter

1829
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:19,970
there were explores as follows my helicopter starts of on the ground i'm going to

1830
01:55:19,970 --> 01:55:23,030
ask myself to i have a good model of the dynamics of i am i

1831
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:25,490
happy with the dynamic model of helicopter

1832
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:27,720
if the answer is yes

1833
01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:33,330
then i'm going exploit that maximize reward function going offline and i give improved that

1834
01:55:33,330 --> 01:55:36,490
doesn't work well if you if if you exploit

1835
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:40,220
the answer is no if you do not have good outcome although what you do

1836
01:55:40,220 --> 01:55:45,130
is you explore what you what that means is you aggressively drive the robot to

1837
01:55:45,130 --> 01:55:49,920
the edges of the export state space to try to deliberately visited states that you

1838
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:53,560
do not have good models for travellers to visit states in the end you find

1839
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:54,430
on the

1840
01:55:54,450 --> 01:56:01,170
on one consisting shows remarkable result with MO's polynomial number of iterations through the cycle

1841
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:06,320
you will then a good model and you can exploit you've near behavior

1842
01:56:08,630 --> 01:56:13,410
o more than the state transition probabilities says piece of the

1843
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:16,360
the station's about these

1844
01:56:16,370 --> 01:56:21,970
so the show a video of of us doing exploration on the helicopter does actually

1845
01:56:21,970 --> 01:56:26,930
issued prior to find the helicopter but this is our our execution of this exploration

1846
01:56:26,930 --> 01:56:31,830
process of aggressive driving helicopter to the edges the of low so they can model

1847
01:56:32,620 --> 01:56:34,800
four dynamics the whole

1848
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:40,050
you see here the human pilots jerking control stick aggressively fought back was many camera

1849
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:42,840
that they write about their

1850
01:56:42,890 --> 01:56:46,410
it's when the roads had blows up and the helicopter crashes

1851
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:47,510
and so

1852
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:55,460
on many systems i think aggressively exploring is this is not a good idea and

1853
01:56:55,490 --> 01:56:56,220
you know

1854
01:56:56,230 --> 01:57:02,300
caching a polynomial number of helicopters

1855
01:57:06,890 --> 01:57:10,880
OK running with the theme of apprenticeship learning this sends out turns out to prove

1856
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:15,180
the following result which is that they can get the human expert pilot to demonstrate

1857
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:19,150
the top demonstrate you would like to use it just five helicopter normally no no

1858
01:57:19,150 --> 01:57:24,330
exploring on one the state action sequence fetuses data and to learn the model the

1859
01:57:24,330 --> 01:57:26,910
the dynamics of the stations are

1860
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:28,550
well i think the model

1861
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:34,750
reward function which assumes given feed into enforcing learning our and just fine and exploitation

1862
01:57:34,750 --> 01:57:39,800
policy pi and they're willing to take exploitation policy pi and use that to find

1863
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:47,810
seven also sells i'll be satisfied with this on behavior is a result of control

1864
01:57:47,900 --> 01:57:51,550
good enough and if the answer is yes they are done and the answer is

1865
01:57:52,150 --> 01:57:57,770
then we take the autonomous behavior we love the state action sequence feed that back

1866
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:00,450
is as additional data which is the

1867
01:58:00,450 --> 01:58:01,750
dynamics model

1868
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:03,880
and it keeps the second from this
