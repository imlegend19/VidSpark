1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,700
right done by chris pizza his group so basically it's alive sparql endpoint the whole

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,660
complete RDF data inside the wiki and you can just create so

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,140
it's also available on semantic web dot org and as you can just go there

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:22,390
and sense parker is the biggest getting information it's a bit complicated set up

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,020
it's well documented again but nevertheless it's

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,910
because you have to run it in the back and take a lot of space

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,980
on your hard disk because the database gets pretty big but you can do it

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,410
was pretty cool

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:42,600
one very nice thing is the semantic forms which is actually developed by your own

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,020
current west example accidentally earlier in the in peter for example

11
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,620
i want to show you where

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,290
interesting semantic mediawiki installation it's going to wikipedia

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:04,140
it's not done by as don't blame me it's

14
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,430
semantic media wiki about

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,660
popular them in

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,430
and the

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,830
it's numbers and company in new york actually

18
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:21,640
and the idea here is that if you have information about r

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,850
on the subject of the pages

20
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,080
know i was

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,470
i think it's definitely not politically correct but i think that but i actually think

22
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,750
that they have done great work on the user interface and thing so what i

23
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,600
really like about the pages of the content i liked what i have done with

24
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,350
user interface magic behind it freely shown that semantics

25
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,660
it can be used even if just thrown out in sixteen year-old boys

26
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,980
and what you have here for example is all the information you have about development

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,250
as in this example her birthday behave

28
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,310
sign how everything is available in RDF you can just go to the page load

29
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:17,540
in the RDF you can either features of the analysis but you can sort them

30
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,250
by these features you can that you can find similar chicks result based on the

31
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,100
semantic information in that case there's a lot of UI goodness for example if you

32
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,910
go changing these kind of pages

33
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,140
and this is the way to semantic forms can

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,370
you actually don't even have to deal with the whole semantic media wiki syntax

35
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:43,200
the only change that is form based figs and everything else happens in the background

36
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,450
completely transparent for the user

37
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,830
i can just choose which colour vision belongs to ensure the birthday

38
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,580
and other features that she has and in this case it gets updated automatically in

39
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,200
the background and it's hidden variables and this is very close to your question earlier

40
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,250
because the have a system like this

41
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,930
which is hiding

42
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,640
the syntax from each

43
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,500
i can actually also created what it's able to do it automatically because

44
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,140
fields and can change it anywhere like

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,520
and semantic forms also an extension to semantic media wiki they can be freely downloaded

46
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,200
than using your page so

47
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,050
there's nothing

48
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,310
happening here that's not available in the

49
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,970
and it did things open source and is available by you in this case here

50
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,960
for example the pictures is hiding a lot of the

51
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,050
syntactical complexity in this case

52
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,420
the question

53
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,170
they were

54
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,500
on the one hand

55
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,680
the interface is completely created inside the wiki

56
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,050
so you don't have to

57
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,250
know PHP HTML CSS and so on

58
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,890
you just have to learn to biggest and which means if you know this kind

59
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,840
of stuff doesn't help you all

60
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,980
so you have to learn the syntax for creating farms and so on

61
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,250
after you don't

62
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,880
it took me about

63
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:25,220
i didn't read semantic from succession myself so hard to learn it and in order

64
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,220
installer you it and have been implemented to me about one hour

65
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,880
category for example

66
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,320
to make it look nice and to make it fun to make a function of

67
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,630
this kind of stuff

68
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,380
it but the problem is that media week it's is already quite technical if you

69
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,600
look at the template syntax

70
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,330
it's really complex in this case

71
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,050
writing in new from scratch

72
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,340
it's hard

73
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,890
copy and pasting and changing the way you like

74
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,330
that's possible and pretty fast

75
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,260
i think that in this case you need someone actually who

76
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,740
is willing to do the technicalities

77
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,000
and also later the garden the wiki so it

78
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,500
i will not happen with simple uses it would be able to be able to

79
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,930
create forms on the fly to create this kind of information to this is more

80
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,750
and we can cite

81
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:53,650
computer network management so we will get back to this application later

82
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,080
another example is analysis of telecommunication calls

83
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,120
so as you can imagine

84
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,070
telecom companies have operational systems to

85
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,310
make calls were

86
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,440
and they can

87
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,190
store began

88
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,730
history of telecommunication calls

89
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,450
we want to analyse

90
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,170
and if they don't they also many telecommunication calls that if don't and i on

91
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,040
the fly it won't be able in the future

92
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,960
to analyse this kind of data

93
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,860
this is typically an example

94
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,580
we want to do

95
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,320
supervision monitoring

96
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:45,620
and this so much data that we have to do this monitoring supervision

97
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,040
on the fly

98
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,010
so use an approach

99
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,500
with a history

100
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,030
so it's the same kind of the same problem appears with the the internet applications

101
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,670
so for instance in rising data generated by

102
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,900
the bay

103
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,770
query on google recommendation system so

104
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:12,050
we want to be able to have a recommendation systems on the fly

105
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,280
when the

106
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,920
a different say have all and this automatically

107
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,370
it's the same for

108
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,250
clickstream analysis

109
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,950
another kind of application is monitoring all

110
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,970
power plants this is one example or in field installation is the same for instance

111
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,670
in power plants you have a system for managing

112
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,880
the power plant

113
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,400
and the the system is based on automatic

114
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,880
which makes the system work there's controlled

115
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,340
and it works

116
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,310
OK and there's another need which is the supervision

117
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,160
monitoring of the system

118
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,940
trying to understand the system goes well

119
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,820
if there are some three years

120
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,340
trying to explain the failures

121
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,810
in this case as well

122
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,190
the amount of data generated by the operation of the system is very high

123
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,010
you can imagine

124
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:22,480
seven thousand seven hundred to get to censors everywhere in the poll

125
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,280
this is the first kind of applications

126
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,090
real time monitoring of information systems

127
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,320
there is another kind of application

128
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,320
which are application

129
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,990
basic data is streaming data

130
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,070
in this case for instance in

131
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,920
when you want to

132
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,910
do fraud detection

133
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,710
for instance in the system

134
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,680
nothing in english it's not the

135
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,630
ATM machines

136
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,640
and in stock market information

137
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,780
so i we get back to to this example

138
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,310
all these systems

139
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,970
that the basic application needs

140
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,750
two processes directly this week

141
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,020
the work and going to present you

142
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,220
and answer to be generic tools for doing so

143
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,730
instead of building at

144
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,910
programs specialized programs

145
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:43,100
so i summarise in this slide the differences between

146
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,180
standard data processing

147
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:51,010
i mean here data processing with standard database systems

148
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,920
this is a data stream processing

149
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,930
i mean here processing data

150
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,000
with this

151
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,310
three approached on the fly

152
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,030
so far

153
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,070
monitoring and business intelligence applications

154
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,730
when you have standard the data processing

155
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,750
what you do is you

156
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,730
i feel

157
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:19,190
data warehouses very large data warehouses and then you like queries and data mining to

158
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,080
the data where

159
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,570
the problem is that

160
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:28,290
in some cases they are so much data but the data were would be

161
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,130
too high

162
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,900
two large

163
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,690
what data stream processing technology

164
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,350
it will provide the possibility of querying and mining

165
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,560
on the fly

166
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:50,050
and still working the querying and mining on detailed data

167
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,380
four applications with basic streaming data

168
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,690
today with on the data processing technology

169
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,360
usually we work without any database system

170
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,700
capturing the streams and producing new streams

171
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,660
of the blood

172
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,550
and what we can expect from the data stream processing technology

173
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,670
is that

174
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,930
it's going to provide generic tools for processing such

175
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,510
training data exactly

176
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,590
the same

177
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,100
what happened with databases

178
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,410
which provide generate two

179
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,550
to deal with to manage data on

180
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,260
so let's

181
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,460
let's go deeper into some

182
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,480
we're going to have a look at for example also network management stock monitoring

183
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,070
and an imaginary one which is the

184
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,370
in world

185
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,360
the network management

186
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:01,470
the problem is the supervision of a computer network

187
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,900
so the computer network

188
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,420
works of the right

189
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,900
every day

190
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,570
we are not trying to make it work

191
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,990
we are trying to monitor to analyse

192
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,280
times the cardinality of y

193
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,260
now if i had a graphical model

194
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,610
the dependencies

195
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,410
we also had long range interaction

196
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,410
and this will become order of elton y square

197
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,950
if i had three times interactions they get the three up here

198
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,010
so you can see that very easily this gets very expensive

199
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,430
more to the point

200
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,050
if i had some very long range interactions there will be completed short

201
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,550
those long range interactions i would need to carry around with me

202
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,280
so there's something called the weight of the junction tree

203
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,720
not gonna going to find this in much detail but as soon as he will

204
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,680
go to implement something like this

205
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,260
you will run into it

206
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,880
so basically what you want to make sure is that a junction tree

207
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,180
o thing junction trees correspond to fast algorithms

208
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,530
that junction trees mean you can't resolve it

209
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,340
a lot of variations on this theme so for instance you can have variable length

210
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,860
boundaries and you will get something like this in a markov model

211
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,300
you can really go wild

212
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,240
in this case

213
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,430
explain what i did before

214
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,570
the only difference

215
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,380
so whatever

216
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,140
on is

217
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:44,030
because i was working wonderful

218
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,050
a connection lost means it follows the game

219
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,120
and i mean

220
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,030
you know that radio four and i

221
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,530
a study

222
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,720
it's a microsoft product

223
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,950
anyway so all

224
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,120
all time he is the difference is that

225
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,800
right the first significant first but

226
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,160
that's really the only difference k

227
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,780
any questions so far

228
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,430
that's what we did

229
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,430
we just do this

230
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,180
i mean we need linear storage

231
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,470
so how can we go

232
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,890
much fancier things

233
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,990
we could use considerably more complicated interactions

234
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,990
like what we have here

235
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,700
we can use really fancy labels

236
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,890
but very mine

237
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,120
the fancy landscape

238
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,240
the bigger this quantity you get

239
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,430
so if you got to really complicated model and maybe ten different labels

240
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,680
input in different labels maybe you can only have three time interactions

241
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,660
if you don't find the labels you could maybe afford into interaction

242
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,820
both of those would require order of one thousand

243
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,990
storage for instance

244
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,780
was two to the team is about to thousands and so is ten to the

245
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,200
so bear in mind that if you go to very fancy labels it will cost

246
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,700
you very dearly and implementing things

247
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,160
things get really messy as soon as you go to the two dimensional structure like

248
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,760
and placed in that case i'd actually recommend that you go and use the conditional

249
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,160
random field and sample

250
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,910
much cheaper

251
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,360
what we have here

252
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,590
dynamic programming

253
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,090
basically is like something like that to be

254
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,640
linear time and space if you do it right

255
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:51,220
and you get actually fairly nice structure estimation from

256
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,800
web page ranking

257
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,700
this is the end of while day

258
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,990
question so far

259
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,680
absolutely right you could

260
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,640
you could do you could start the recursion from the and then peel of things

261
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,880
from the in

262
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,200
for the last term

263
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,160
you would have it off while plus one in wales

264
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,820
what about what would happen is you could start feeling of things from the and

265
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,840
then you will get the first first

266
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,200
so you can either have forward backward algorithm or backward forward algorithm

267
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,720
it doesn't make computation much easier

268
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,680
obviously when you implemented you could also implemented from both scenes

269
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,660
so in america analysis this is called the bayes algorithm

270
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,660
burnett both scenes

271
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,910
so if you google for baby and

272
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:02,160
as solution of linear systems you find exactly that

273
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,800
good now

274
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,410
this is another instance

275
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,390
fairly strange loss functions people might care about

276
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:18,010
well we can go and the structure estimation to get some good reason

277
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,430
so the idea is

278
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,950
at least very

279
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,660
character way of looking at what search engine does

280
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,700
got a bunch of documents the i for the query

281
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,070
maybe also know something about the user

282
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,780
and so now if you want to do is you want to find ranking of

283
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,840
this is the most relevant documents come first

284
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,950
and let's for the moment the same

285
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,410
good ratings of the web page is going somewhere from zero to five

286
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,680
these might happen because

287
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,390
in the case of the star it

288
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,780
a company actually hired

289
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,970
essentially people in india and china

290
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,200
to sit down and for this query in a bunch of web pages related to

291
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,300
each other things

292
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,830
so that's pretty good

293
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,540
that says that in the best case quicksort is going to do well

294
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,190
how about let's suppose this split

295
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,180
it is always

296
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:17,970
let's say one ten

297
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,220
nine tenths

298
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,440
k one

299
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,570
ten times and

300
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,880
nine tenths timestamp

301
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,270
i suppose it's always

302
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,830
the case that

303
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,800
in that case are we like here we are lucky

304
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:48,540
displayed is really skew

305
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:52,020
we're clearly going to be unlucky

306
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,620
right because as

307
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,390
they want an

308
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,430
there's really in the middle it's analog and what do you suppose it is if

309
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,760
one tenth

310
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,460
to nine is that what you're unlucky

311
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:13,160
who thinks of little democracy here OK who thinks that that's the lucky case

312
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,880
OK i was can be fast and time and who thinks it's an unlucky case

313
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,480
OK so we have some great on who didn't vote

314
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,030
o on

315
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,580
come on

316
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,700
come on picture

317
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,620
it's always better is always better by the way too

318
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,800
say yes or no and be right or wrong because then you have some emotional

319
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,260
commitment to it and you remember better

320
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,700
OK around is sitting in inquiry

321
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,070
OK you get no

322
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,870
you know manipulate your own emotions well enough to remember things well

323
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,290
so those people who voted win over the people who don't know whether they're right

324
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,530
or wrong

325
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:55,560
so well let's let's take a look so here's the recurrence CNN is equal to

326
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,970
t one ten n plus t

327
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,590
nine tenths and

328
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,690
and we assume that this is

329
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,570
this part here is less equal to some CN

330
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,850
in order to analyse the soldiers to recursion tree for this

331
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,210
and c

332
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,880
this recursion tree

333
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,080
three years

334
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,890
that's equal to c

335
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,850
two one ten

336
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,330
eighty nine ten

337
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,520
now we have again c and the top

338
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:50,000
this gets complicated right as one can see

339
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,990
now over here we have

340
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,680
one ten and then were plugging into the recursion again so we now get to

341
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,270
one hundred

342
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,850
and over here we get t

343
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,030
nine one hundred

344
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,310
over here we have now

345
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:17,260
nine kansas city

346
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,100
that gives us here t of

347
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,280
l nine

348
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,080
one hundred and again

349
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,930
here we get t

350
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,030
eighty one hundred

351
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,450
and we keep going on

352
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,530
this equal to

353
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,780
probably all this

354
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,390
c and

355
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,560
one ten c

356
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,660
that is why we have one one hundred c and

357
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:02,490
that keeps going down until we get to order one down here

358
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,760
and over here

359
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,390
we have

360
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,510
nine tenths c

361
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,140
here see this is mine

362
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,810
one hundred

363
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,580
c and

364
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,120
this is now

365
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:23,370
nine one hundred c and this is eighty one one hundred c

366
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,930
and these things keep going

367
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:32,490
so they get banned or the one with the leaves are not all uniform depth

368
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,140
here right

369
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,580
in this site is way further up

370
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,260
then this side

371
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,950
right because you're only going down by nine-tenths each time

372
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,260
so in fact what's the height

373
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,700
looking for which the length of this path here

374
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:59,370
following this path down to this we might take the leftmost fine

375
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:11,180
somebody raise your hand

376
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,930
log base ten of

377
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,810
OK log

378
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,890
they ten

379
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,060
OK because i'm basically cutting down by a factor of ten each time and how

380
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,720
long does it take me to reduce to one that's the definition if you will

381
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,120
of one loggers

382
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,800
OK log base ten

383
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,700
OK what is this one

384
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,120
but this path

385
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,140
going that way

386
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,830
o lord they of and

387
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,180
log base ten over ninety

388
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,200
because we're going down by nine pence each time

389
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,390
OK once again essentially the definition of band

390
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:07,330
and everything in between there is somewhere between log base ten of and and log

391
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,120
base ten nine so that

392
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,450
OK so everything is it in between their

393
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,240
so now what i can do is do the trick that we did from merge

394
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,390
sort in looking at what the evaluation of the system by adding up what's

395
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,660
what's the cost to the top left

396
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,470
let's just see and

397
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,760
what's the cost to the next level

398
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,530
and what's the cost to the next level

399
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,450
c and

400
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,870
so every level we're still doing the same amount of work

401
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,620
and we take that all the way down

402
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,850
the last level so eventually we had some point was not equal to and where

403
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,080
we get getting things are less than or equal to c and because some believe

404
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,780
start dropping out

405
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,910
OK starting at this level

406
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,600
we keep getting

407
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,160
so we basically this part is going to be log base ten and then we

408
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,410
start getting things are less than or equal to c and

409
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,300
and so forth

410
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,890
until finally we

411
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,970
get at all

412
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,830
OK so t then

413
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,890
this can be less than or equal to

414
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,450
c and times what's the longest

415
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,740
this could possibly be

416
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,760
log base ten

417
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:42,370
so i can nights and

418
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,120
OK plus

419
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,210
the last class we talked about the brain

420
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:50,580
now let's talk a little bit about some foundations

421
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,990
so today

422
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,280
on monday

423
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,870
i want to talk about two very big ideas

424
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,240
and these ideas are associated

425
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,640
with sigmund freud

426
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,920
and b f skinner

427
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,960
and our psychoanalysis and behaviorism

428
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,440
and i want to talk about psychoanalysis

429
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,440
and behaviors next week

430
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,230
now one of these things

431
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,290
one of the things that makes these theory so interesting is there scope

432
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,420
most of the work going to talk about in this class most of the ideas

433
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,950
are narrow so that was somebody's that somebody's idea

434
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,830
about racial prejudice

435
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,690
but that's not a theory of language acquisition

436
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,460
we'll talk about theories of schizophrenia

437
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,420
but they are not

438
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,710
explanations of sexual attractiveness

439
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,690
most theories are specialized theories

440
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,270
with these two views are grand

441
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:50,420
here is the theories of everything encompassing just about everything that matters

442
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:55,120
day-to-day life child development mental illness religion war love

443
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,720
freud and skinner had explanations of all of these

444
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,050
now this is not a history course

445
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:06,640
i have zero interest in describing historical figures in psychology just for the sake of

446
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,060
telling about the history of the field

447
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,650
what i want to tell you about that is i want to talk about these

448
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,650
ideas because so much rests on the

449
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,490
and even more importantly

450
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,510
a lot of these ideas have a critical influence

451
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,160
on how we think about

452
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:27,240
the present

453
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,880
and that's the

454
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:35,200
for better or worse we live in a world profoundly affected by sigmund freud

455
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:40,230
if i had to ask you to choose the cycle name a famous psychologist

456
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,950
mostly freud he's the most famous psychologist ever

457
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,230
he's had a profound influence

458
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,550
on the twentieth and twenty first century

459
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,240
some biographical information he was born in eighteen

460
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,220
fifty is he spent most of his life in vienna austria

461
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,560
and but he died in london

462
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,910
and he escaped to london soon after retreating there

463
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,770
at the beginning of world war two

464
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,830
as the nazis began to occupy

465
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,290
where he lived

466
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,940
he's one of the most famous scholars ever

467
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,930
but is not known for any single discovery

468
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:23,240
instead is known for the development of an encompassing theory of mind one developed over

469
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,140
the span of many decades

470
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,480
he was in his time extremely well known

471
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,270
celebrity recognise on the street

472
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:36,450
and throughout his life he was a man of extraordinary energy and productivity

473
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,650
in part because he was very serious cocaine addict but also just in general uses

474
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,490
the high energy sort of person

475
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,880
he was up for the nobel prize in medicine and literature

476
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,770
didn't get either one of them

477
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,290
didn't get the prize in medicine because albert einstein

478
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,010
everybody loves albert einstein what albert einstein really wrote wrote a letter because they have

479
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,970
opinions about the nobel prize well let's think don't give the prize to freud

480
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,130
he doesn't deserve a nobel prize just a psychologist

481
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:17,910
while is almost universally acclaimed as a profoundly important intellectual figure is also the object

482
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,320
of considerable dislike

483
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,400
this is in part because of his character

484
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,810
he was not a very nice man in many ways he was deeply ambitious

485
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,630
the cause of promoting psychoanalysis the cause presenting his view

486
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:39,100
in defending it any was often dishonest extremely brutal to his friends

487
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,380
and i'm terrible to his enemies he was an interesting character my favorite freud story

488
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,170
was as he was leaving europe

489
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,360
during the rise of the nazis

490
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,060
as he was ready to go

491
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,900
to go to england from i think either germany or austria

492
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:01,150
he had to sign a letter from the gestapo gestapo agents intercepted

493
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,800
and demanded he sign a letter saying that at no point in even threatened or

494
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,730
harassed by the stop

495
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,320
he signs the letter

496
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,980
in any rights underneath it

497
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,330
the gestapo was not harmed in any way

498
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,960
in fact i highly recommend the gestapo everybody

499
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,440
it is

500
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,490
he had a certain aggression to him

501
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:27,120
he was also he's also disliked often hated

502
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:31,760
because of his views he was seen as a sexual renegade out to destroy the

503
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,710
conception of people

504
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,610
as good and rational pure beings in when the nazis rose to power in the

505
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,960
nineteen thirties

506
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,090
he was identified as jew

507
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:47,690
was devoted to destroying the most sacred notions of christianity and many expect to some

508
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:50,980
extent many people see in this way

509
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:55,150
and to some extent on this accusation has some truth to it

510
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:58,320
freud made claims about people

511
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,840
that many of us

512
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,860
maybe most of us would rather not now

513
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,760
well OK

514
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,040
what is he saying

515
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,110
well it's

516
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,580
if you have somebody who doesn't like freud what he said bill describe some of

517
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:15,440
the other things he said in in fact freud said a lot of things some

518
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,740
of which were not very rational

519
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:25,520
for instance he is well known for his account of phallic symbols arguing certain architectural

520
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,590
monuments are

521
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:36,460
subconsciously developed as penile representations and related to this we developed notorious theory penis envy

522
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:40,950
and penis envy is isn't an account of the developmental state that every one of

523
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:46,500
you who was female has gone through according to freud and ideas that you discovered

524
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,250
at some point during development that you lack the penis

525
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,190
this is not this is a catastrophe

526
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,900
and so each of you inferred

527
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,290
at that point that you've been castrated you at once

528
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,010
happiness was somebody had taken from you

529
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,060
you then

530
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,200
turn to your father

531
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,240
and love your father

532
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:15,140
because your father has a penis so these are the penis substitute you reject your

533
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,630
mother was equally unworthy due to her penis lack

534
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,810
and that she serious psychosexual development

535
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,970
now that the sort of thing you know about freud you're not going to have

536
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,290
a very high opinion

537
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,460
of him or his work

538
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:37,130
at the core of freud's explanation the more interesting idea is is a set of

539
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,680
of immense intellectual importance

540
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,030
and the two main ones are that's the two main ones involved existence of an

541
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,430
unconscious motivation

542
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,590
and the notion of unconscious dynamics are unconscious conflict

543
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,670
which lead to mental illnesses

544
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:58,530
in so social social construction part of this is very important

545
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,800
so that means that somebody has taught us what's food while our family has taught

546
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,900
us our culture taught us but the food industry has taught to what food and

547
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:12,030
what's not for but not only that they've taught us what constitutes healthy food unhealthy

548
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,400
they've been very influential in teaching us how much of things we should eat

549
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,020
and look at that in this commercial that you're about to see

550
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:24,420
and also the social context this

551
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,670
who's deciding what you should be

552
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:32,130
and here there's a very male-dominated thing you'll see pretty quickly

553
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:36,440
and what you see in this is that this man has been told in men

554
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,550
who watch the obviously email or in the sort of thing that that i've seen

555
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:45,900
watching sporting events in the life this very interesting theme here and this not too

556
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,440
hard to pick up

557
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,920
so let's play this

558
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,150
so we may need to have a high volume on this because this is pretty

559
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,030
now this is needs a more by k

560
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,720
and again volume

561
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,240
OK i try to correct this problem

562
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,800
you know it's possible i've got my own

563
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,240
i have my soundtrack

564
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,510
the there when again any volume

565
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,380
let me try it again

566
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,590
here we go

567
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:26,920
all right so what are what are some of the things that you pick up

568
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,690
when you see something like that

569
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,320
i mean there's obviously the manly thing what what messages being given to the men

570
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,090
who see this yes

571
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,760
OK that even healthy is a girl thing to do

572
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,970
correct what else

573
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,800
real and many me that's correct yes

574
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,260
small portions are bad that's right yes

575
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:57,380
OK all men wanted because they're variety of men in their yes

576
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,860
OK the man the man is in charge of his dietary destiny he's making own

577
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,570
decision as you said

578
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,990
no woman is going to tell them the key ch for that you may have

579
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,340
missed it but but in the song there will show this later in class again

580
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,570
but in the song they say that i want you kesh anymore and go by

581
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,780
the total fluid things like that yes

582
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,320
OK that's right i mean it's well it's it's it's not said directly but that's

583
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,380
inferred isn't because all these are you know they're doing almost all kinds of things

584
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,510
and there eating the texas double whopper that they're not showing them killing over from

585
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,030
the triple bypass surgery

586
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:43,110
right here right because you waste your money for by these walls portions the healthy

587
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,150
food that's exactly right

588
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:50,490
OK longer sit-down meals are necessary because you can just go by it all of

589
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:55,010
a sudden OK you guys role right is an interesting how many messages are embedded

590
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,010
in that short advertisment

591
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,920
and it's done with song it's done visually all sorts of things are embedded in

592
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,260
there and i'll show you some other advertisments later that are oriented to man make

593
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,510
that same argument that

594
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:12,340
if you're a man nobody is going to tell you what the

595
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:19,010
burger king mine but nobody and so that becomes very interesting theme in these advertisments

596
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,700
so that's what that's and we could show you dozens and dozens of these sort

597
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,570
of things we will over the course of the class each one of them very

598
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,860
OK the next one and like to show you

599
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:34,400
is the KFC ad and this ran fairly recently i know if it's still on

600
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,010
the air but and fairly recently look at this and then we'll

601
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,510
analyse the themes in this

602
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:47,470
all o

603
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,740
here in the

604
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,280
OK so

605
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,490
what's embedded in this manner

606
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,590
KFC and now

607
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,720
now is healthy right yes

608
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:14,360
OK so there was the family theme here that now the TFC is healthy it

609
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,590
becomes something the whole family can enjoy yes

610
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:22,840
OK it still tastes good despite not having transferred yes

611
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:28,400
OK you don't have to change things because it's now built into the healthier quote

612
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,940
healthier versions yes although in that

613
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,400
OK so again please

614
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:41,150
those were exciting their kids this is there yes

615
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:49,220
is more important than family right and what about what about how fast and how

616
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,150
the sort of lack of control and now i can kind of binge on are

617
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,190
you don't that the weight of the family sits down to eat

618
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,340
it can be an accident it's an african-american family

619
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,650
depicted here so there are a lot of interesting things going on in this little

620
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,590
video clip now there's the political

621
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:15,550
in business history this because KFC is is larger companies it is owned by larger

622
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,630
parent company believe it or not called yum brands

623
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:25,880
and young brands owns owns other food related chains like talking about all but yum

624
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,550
brands responded in a very interesting way

625
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:34,110
when the call to remove trans-fat first came out

626
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,820
and they were pretty slow off the mark to do something about this and it

627
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,050
was after

628
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:43,380
lawsuits were filed that they actually made the change but here they are boasting about

629
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,420
the change

630
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,510
presenting the

631
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:51,510
the picture to the world that well look at what this wonderful thing we did

632
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,440
we took out trans fats and now you can eat as much of it is

633
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:00,300
you want is they don't say about one could infer that from the advertising and

634
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,880
the fact is food is healthier if it has less transfer but it depends on

635
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,820
what fats swapped out for because if you you put a healthier fat and then

636
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:13,360
it's then you get a certain amount of improvement but if you put less happy

637
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,320
healthy family and you get some improvement but last but also switching out the trans

638
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,320
fats from another kind of that doesn't change the calories are all still has the

639
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,110
same number of calories and obesity is a huge problem in the united states especially

640
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:31,260
in the african-american community and other minority communities

641
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,860
and so to imply that now you can you all you want

642
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,960
you've been issued free to get if you will

643
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,900
some people might consider

644
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,900
not the right message

645
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,630
when we think about the way food is marketed

646
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,130
we have to ask ourselves how are these messages frames

647
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:55,010
who would have been targeted what the message is that of course what the impact

648
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:59,850
is and you guys over the course of your life have been exposed to an

649
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,490
number of food messages an enormous number

650
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:07,690
so far greater than i was when i was a boy

651
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,050
and they've come in different forms

652
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:14,050
when i was a boy there is one form in one form only

653
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:19,050
and it was cartoon it was on saturday morning cartoons there was advertisments for foods

654
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,690
on that it was mainly for sugared cereals

655
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,110
the boy

656
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,170
if you think about your advertising landscape

657
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,800
so much different than mine was

658
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,690
how is it different

659
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:36,720
no no no

660
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:51,900
and i

661
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,490
they patients

662
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,860
she is

663
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:26,330
you might national

664
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,280
or two

665
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,750
the story of conscious mind

666
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,190
one of

667
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:28,720
what for

668
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,990
also company

669
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:43,420
it was before

670
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,790
and so i

671
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,790
do of course

672
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,310
this will not be

673
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,250
the going

674
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,220
but i mentioned

675
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:33,050
four for

676
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,520
also on what we want our

677
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:57,540
four i might

678
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,150
all right

679
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,650
of the core

680
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:30,090
and what happened now is

681
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:44,810
what do you worry

682
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,310
o was

683
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,050
in the world

684
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,730
well is the world

685
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:04,650
o conference what kind of different cultures

686
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,600
it is important

687
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:24,110
what you want

688
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:31,540
one more thing

689
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:40,400
but that's the problem

690
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:44,510
o or one we

691
00:46:51,690 --> 00:47:02,590
thank you

692
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,690
four or

693
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:16,370
well a lot

694
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,570
one or

695
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:33,890
don't launch for i come look for

696
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:40,700
of this one will

697
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,840
o information

698
00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:01,570
so what is the problem

699
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,130
in my opinion

700
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:10,770
where is complex

701
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:12,950
this is line

702
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,340
knowledge are

703
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:33,020
we have to use proper

704
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,390
you are right

705
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,750
what's going on in fact one

706
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:56,420
the investment

707
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,920
to play it safe

708
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:02,240
we are going to try to have an analytic solution and then use the lasso

709
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:09,130
penalty tool made to see the coefficients of those base letters that were not helping

710
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:18,090
at all

711
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,840
and i guess summation now now

712
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:26,920
this organisation is going to be the in a very very very large space

713
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,420
and so on

714
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:34,510
i think this is the first time that i cited reference for you to identify

715
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:39,990
as possible the reasons for solving these for our idea of loss functions

716
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:46,340
so now let's look at the traditionalism methods and what i have here on the

717
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:49,240
right is the template that we just

718
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,300
this cost

719
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,340
and so

720
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:57,880
bagging ordinarily for regression was using the square loss absolute

721
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,670
two lonely seed or in the case of bargains and so if you look at

722
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,650
these if absolutely zero

723
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:04,880
there's no memory

724
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,440
so if so n minus one

725
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,920
become CEO and when we

726
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,210
well that here there's no memory

727
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,720
so every tree

728
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:18,150
that is added into lagging has no notion of the all the trees that have

729
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:20,720
already been selected

730
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,920
and it is in our tool

731
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,220
the sun namely

732
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,610
have some balls

733
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:34,970
without replacement building and buying formulation actually called for bootstrap samples of size n

734
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:40,260
a bootstrap sampling with replacement and it can be shown that is equivalent to half

735
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,420
samples without replacement

736
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,450
so so it is an or two in the case of bagging

737
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,650
data base learners

738
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:55,010
with typically a

739
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:59,610
trees and in particular they they have a large and growing trees

740
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:03,630
and then we see when we get to market

741
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:06,090
that is why

742
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:11,570
there are situations where this is not

743
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,280
the best thing to the coefficients

744
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,800
the coefficients in bagging or simply one over

745
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:22,440
namely the the average they are not fit to the data so bagging doesn't have

746
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,900
the post processing of feeding the coefficients to the data after the trees have been

747
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:32,690
selected just simply assigns the same coefficient to all the trees

748
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,780
in other words what bagging is doing is doing one of the three possible perturbations

749
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,210
it's perturbing that i distribution

750
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:46,880
because he has

751
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,570
no memory

752
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:52,340
a bagging is parallelizable because every tree

753
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:57,400
that seems have it's built every tree that is added to symbolise bill without

754
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:01,740
concern for the trees you could literally

755
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,880
it's funny every

756
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:09,990
many of these are main problems entirely from machine and get all your trees back

757
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:12,320
so that's an advantage

758
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:19,090
in our you can play with by using the i've read package and we've seen

759
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:24,530
the iplayer package that is the hybrid that come

760
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:32,240
let's let's look at a little example of bargain in actual

761
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,740
so very simple that said

762
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,820
from there from the

763
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:42,420
ESL book the DSL is the element of statistical learning book dissect classic in our

764
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:47,070
and therefore references etc etc in the back

765
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:52,320
and so this is one particular example from that book so very simple it's five

766
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:56,220
the most strongly correlated don't stand

767
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:01,670
standardize normal variables with correlation of point nine five

768
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:07,260
and then the response the world is so i two class problem generated according to

769
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,300
this rule

770
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,590
and so

771
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:13,490
so again the response depends only on x one

772
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,050
we building the response ourselves and so if

773
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,550
x one is less than

774
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:25,150
in this understand that i also it gives you a sense of the range means

775
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,940
and one standard deviation

776
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,470
so even if the

777
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,550
algorithm which is called the billiard which

778
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,770
which which run long enough will find the

779
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,570
posterior mean that of the posterior

780
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:42,230
and to again and again comparing it to other algorithms

781
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:45,850
which were proposed for problem by happen winter

782
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,870
and we find that amongst all the organs on this problem

783
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,670
it is problem but after on this problem you get a very good accuracy from

784
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,590
the it's also very fast

785
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:00,790
and around the sun

786
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,310
so if you read my thesis i run this on various other problems and you

787
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:08,450
also get yours very high quality solutions even larger problems in a very small amount

788
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,380
of time

789
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:14,090
the main problem in terms of practicality of this algorithm is that i'm using a

790
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:19,870
full multivariate gaussians my approximation which will get huge if you lot of features if

791
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:24,480
you have two thousand features to have a covariance matrix of the two thousand weight

792
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:30,340
so one of open research problems is to try and use a less complex

793
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,730
representation of the gaussians so some people have used bag gaussians which is obviously one

794
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:39,530
extreme and that works fine for using a huge amount of coverage information do that

795
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:43,330
so interesting idea would be to try and use a more structured

796
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:47,780
approximations of covariance matrix in which is not just diagonal and not fully

797
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:52,350
i haven't seen anyone tried it yet interesting opportunity

798
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,510
to get to scale to bigger problems

799
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:58,060
meeting ones with lots of features

800
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,360
OK so

801
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,820
what about kernels

802
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,070
so you can apply this album with kernels as well

803
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,380
in fact

804
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:12,400
what you find is that if you look at the BP updates for this problem

805
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:16,790
the only depend on inner products between data points

806
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,340
and so if you want to play kernels all you have to do

807
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:23,120
actually my thesis you can just take you can just literally take all of the

808
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,640
equations you had for the EP updates and just find everywhere you take an inner

809
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,340
product and replaced with some kernel function

810
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,650
and you can use actually cries

811
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:33,610
so this allows you to

812
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,520
if it

813
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:38,480
linear decision boundaries so in this case i can choose

814
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,230
for example gaussian kernel

815
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,340
and i'll get decision boundaries that look like this

816
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,440
and the difference in his decision boundaries this time sharing the same data set

817
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,570
three times

818
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:49,300
just fit using EP

819
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,920
with three different

820
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,670
kernel with three different six

821
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:54,960
in my kind of functions

822
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,440
and that gives you a different different roughness to decision boundary

823
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:02,530
so this would be a small panel with no big

824
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:08,000
and again you see using the same IP over them but just replacing every inner

825
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,320
product with the form on the right

826
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:17,610
but this is an interesting question is how would you choose to grow it

827
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:21,980
right now because we were in a bayesian framework we can use bayesian model comparison

828
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,610
to to with

829
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:28,340
we have to invent any sort of new year's text issues kernel with

830
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,070
and so

831
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:33,230
as chris showed in this talk the way you can choose models in a bayesian

832
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:36,270
setting is just compute the posterior probability of that model

833
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,420
and the posterior probability of the model

834
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,070
is simply

835
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:45,610
this is simply the probability that the model assigns the data

836
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:49,440
integrated over all possible parameter

837
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:53,340
so essentially what that means is we pick the kernel

838
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,940
to get the posterior on w for that particular kernel

839
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,690
right and duty we compute the probability of our training set having interviewed out all

840
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:05,320
the possible way back

841
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,420
i can explain what that means geometrically

842
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:13,480
suppose i have

843
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:17,590
my sphere again going back my fear which gets caught

844
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:19,710
by my training data

845
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,690
and i have some posterior distribution which is in

846
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:29,460
in this in this simplified situation the

847
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:34,090
model evidence is simply the area of the region

848
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:36,000
because that's that's literally

849
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:43,000
the integral of all of those indicator functions so the probability of the data

850
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,920
in my in my simple case

851
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,860
it is just

852
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:59,920
times the product of all those indicator functions

853
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:07,380
so this is my model evidence

854
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,880
and also also saying is what's the probability that a random weight vector drawn from

855
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,650
my prior which satisfy all the constraints of data

856
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:19,860
just how many characters or the on sphere which satisfies the constraints

857
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,770
that's essentially what that area competitions such as the area

858
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,020
of that

859
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:25,170
these young here

860
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:27,250
that's your model evidence

861
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:31,590
and the next byproduct of EP is that you can get this model evidence out

862
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,940
and i would argue the former for that little bit there

863
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,570
but essentially as you as you running EP can get you can compute these normalizing

864
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:42,270
constants theta those messages that you can hear it and you can put them together

865
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:46,960
and get a good day an approximate model evidence for the entire model

866
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,820
so essentially you sort of collecting where every time you clip those multivariate gaussians at

867
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:54,550
each stage you can remember how much mass to take the ball and keep track

868
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:56,130
of how much mass is left

869
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:59,230
in your in your and your posterior essentially

870
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,360
this sort of intuition of our

871
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:05,380
and so what we do is we keep changing the kernel

872
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,840
and by changing the kernel going to change these hyperplanes because essentially we're changing the

873
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,020
data set is we're changing the mapping pointed out there so we can change the

874
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,750
way these hyperplanes are arranged in feature space because the changes in different kernels

875
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,900
and give different areas

876
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,340
on the sphere

877
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:22,500
and so i will use that

878
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,300
will compare the size of those areas to pick the best kernel

879
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,460
it's essentially what bayesian model comparison is trying to do so

880
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,440
in sort of an intuitive sense saying she was the kernel where unified chosen my

881
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:38,980
decision boundary randomly i would be very likely to separate the data

882
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,230
OK so

883
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43,270
for the dataset but i showed you earlier this ends up being the highest probability

884
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:48,380
which is what i think is a bit intuitive i mean so what it does

885
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,820
is it uses the kernel

886
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,860
which is reasonably smooth

887
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:55,150
and the reason why you want to be smooth because if it was a random

888
00:59:55,150 --> 01:00:01,340
smooth decision boundary i have a better chance of suffering the random complicated country

889
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:05,500
so if you're actresses talk in bayesian model selection is essentially the same argument there

890
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,090
program because i'm telling you i'm not sure what

891
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:10,140
you know

892
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,220
anyway it's interesting to think about the a bunch of nash equilibrium so for instance

893
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:22,300
so think what the

894
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:25,150
this this is this is

895
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:33,570
this is an equilibrium that the splitter offering dollars using seven dollars an equilibrium if

896
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:36,800
that user has been accepted although there is no reason for split off from more

897
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,030
and at this point is going up dollar

898
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,170
and that jesus doesn't want to do that

899
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:46,560
offering two dollars accepting two dollars also nicolas offering three dollars accepting results in

900
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,450
these are all equilibrium

901
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,160
if you're you're here there's no reason neither player the standard previous so that's why

902
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,750
it's kind of interest

903
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:04,510
you see that

904
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:05,900
is also

905
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:22,400
the reasons why

906
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:30,290
o thing

907
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:41,360
i mean it's for me to it is actually glory have different

908
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:46,610
you know in some sense correspond to each player acting in a more aggressive manner

909
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:49,410
and the other and

910
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:50,300
you could

911
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,020
one way might analyse this is if you also

912
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:56,500
use something called utility theory where you say well how much is three dollars were

913
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:00,830
how much does it work with the happiness they get from three dollars kind of

914
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:04,260
depends on how much money you have already if this was if this was thousands

915
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:08,090
of dollars so was one thousand to two thousand three thousand is actually change the

916
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,360
way people play

917
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:12,650
you know if you think about so i'm not going to go in that direction

918
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:15,650
but it's kind of interesting things

919
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,470
OK one more thing

920
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:23,560
in game theory is so we can also help help minimax optimality can also help

921
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:27,010
us to think about posting this slide is an indian outside just to put it

922
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:33,130
so this is the thing about this thing so everyone familiar with this thing

923
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:39,080
so imagine you have an algorithm that for any distribution or things like the available

924
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:44,200
for instance for any probably feature weighting function with some datasets this algorithm is able

925
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:48,490
to find the rule in some class they get less than forty percent from the

926
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:52,860
boosting languages as the weak hypothesis OK so i from is that a large data

927
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,060
for any weighting function over that i have semantic algorithm is able to find the

928
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:58,770
rule they get

929
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,380
are less than forty percent

930
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:04,500
then with adaboost does is it gives away to use this algorithm

931
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:09,780
it basically runs the algorithm on uniform distribution gets back to rule reweights the data

932
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:14,990
around again it's back rule reweights the data use it in a way that

933
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:22,260
that has the property that by taking those rules and using a weighted vote of

934
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:27,300
the rules you get that we all have here going to zero

935
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:30,900
OK so it was nice algorithm that can like you take these rules and combine

936
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,270
them way

937
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:37,210
and one thing that's interesting to think about this is a weaker statement native but

938
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:40,540
imagine that you are kind of trying to come up with adaboost and and you

939
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:44,060
might want to think she is even possible to do this

940
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:45,040
i mean

941
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,480
how do we know that

942
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:53,480
i'm guaranteed for any weighting function over the dataset there exists a rule in my

943
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,860
class as they are less important some assuming that

944
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:02,020
why should that suggest it's even possible to have a weighted vote was very close

945
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:03,840
to zero

946
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,710
before we actually tried to come up with adaboost you know this is asking the

947
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:11,380
so the nice way to think about this is again

948
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:12,900
so the

949
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,980
this is the

950
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:24,230
i just picking some numbers less than fifty percent of the with boosting the rate

951
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:27,060
at which this goes to zero the number of times you have to call

952
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:28,250
the algorithm

953
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:31,860
it depends on the gap between these AR fifty percent

954
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,210
so for instance if they all have their less than forty percent of the gap

955
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:36,170
between one

956
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:41,480
roughly you have to call one over that's where number of times

957
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:45,000
one of the gap roughly

958
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:48,900
in order to get

959
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,360
one can get squared loss

960
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,420
what happened to get this area down the so so that the the rate at

961
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:57,400
which the school stands can depend on how much better

962
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:59,860
fifty percent

963
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:02,480
but if you for just taken

964
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:03,630
so here's how

965
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:07,110
so we could use a nice way to do this is a zero sum game

966
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:11,230
so imagine that and the copyright on my examples of the set up and down

967
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:14,420
here i write all the hypotheses and i

968
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,270
in my hypothesis space

969
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:18,170
we made

970
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:20,860
and have the entry here b one

971
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,710
if this hypothesis makes a mistake on an example in zero to get the correct

972
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:29,980
this is like alot matrix OK says this hypothesis does or does not become if

973
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:34,690
they can give an example of big matrix the thing is i think that's the

974
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:36,900
thing about the matrix

975
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:41,750
so what we're we're assuming we we start with the assumption that for any

976
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:45,630
waiting for any probability distribution over the column

977
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:47,940
there exists around

978
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,400
was cost around that one the algorithm a will find

979
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,690
this cost is less than point four

980
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:55,090
because the cost

981
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:58,130
distribution is exactly the probability of making a mistake

982
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:02,320
we assume the star which was the free distribution over the examples there exists a

983
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,170
hypothesis in fact the algorithm finds one those there is the most

984
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:08,210
twenty four

985
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:13,690
let's see what is the minimax theorem tells the minimax theorem says if it's true

986
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:19,340
for any distribution over the columns there exists the road cos most point four that

987
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:22,400
means there must exist the distribution of the rows

988
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:26,290
so for any color the expected cost is point four

989
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,980
now what does that mean for us

990
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,540
OK was just interpret the minimax theorem in this context so

991
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:36,230
OK so as so we are given a pretty distribution over there

992
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:41,000
problems are just around the the most point four that implied by the minimax theorem

993
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,630
there is the distribution over the rose for the first caller expected customers point four

994
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:51,520
particular what that means must exist a weighting function over the reals

995
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:53,960
distribution weighting function

996
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,980
that was the mean of expected cost most point four

997
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,710
it means that for every

998
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:01,360
for example for every color

999
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,440
the about

1000
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:07,770
goes at least sixty forty in the right direction

1001
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:11,770
the reason for the pick one of the ages from distribution we have at most

1002
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:15,060
forty percent chance of getting the right answer another way of saying that is about

1003
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:16,750
sixty forty

1004
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,130
that makes the whole world

1005
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:24,400
see that normally minimax thinking and this is the probability distribution and

1006
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,810
we're saying it is the point four chance of making a mistake if we pick

1007
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:31,540
one random but equivalent to saying that if think of it as of o

1008
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:36,400
the vote because only sixty four right

1009
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,710
good so what does that mean

1010
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:45,480
oh no no no no tried

1011
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:48,400
i can make a difference

1012
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,860
and there's nothing

1013
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:04,520
so what does that mean

1014
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:10,150
that means that there exists a weighted vote of the hypotheses that gets everybody right

1015
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,180
to say

1016
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:13,400
i'm just going

1017
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:21,170
the new approximation of these approximations are going to come up with an approximation

1018
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:22,590
of this guy

1019
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:26,110
and to web is this approximation is very simple

1020
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,600
these probability distribution here

1021
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:34,040
because these things are just point beta distribution OK we can

1022
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,750
and guys on i'm going to

1023
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,370
and times

1024
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,020
from these distributions

1025
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:45,570
OK so i'm going to sample from the discrete distribution and time we sample times

1026
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,510
one that i'm building

1027
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:52,760
basically my new approximation is the on pierre called

1028
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,960
the reason the value of k

1029
01:08:57,010 --> 01:09:00,210
so why does he do the job

1030
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:04,520
why does the genome unforgettable that

1031
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,910
it does the job because essentially

1032
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:10,360
if you have a weight which is quite high

1033
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,280
the policy assumes so omega and

1034
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:19,040
i notice is is i value then the probability that when you're gonna resampled capital

1035
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:24,080
times from these discrete distributions the polity you going to make the

1036
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,140
number valuable

1037
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:31,660
the particle i know it is quite high so the possibility can copy multiple times

1038
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:35,580
the particle i know it is quite high so that's why you can multiple copy

1039
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,270
most likely online

1040
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:39,730
on the contrary it is guy

1041
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:41,420
basically small

1042
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:46,750
compared to one of and then essentially when you're gonna resample capital and times when

1043
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,790
this guy you might be

1044
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:53,250
you might be kind of lucky that is well you might have been nice guy

1045
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:55,630
on you might have basically

1046
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:59,250
you might have kept one of the particle with the lowest

1047
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:04,460
so you know completely best actually you can keep some particles with low weights but

1048
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:10,440
it quite small possibility most likely does more weight it that survives to this was

1049
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:14,650
sampling scheme in this part in this new approximation

1050
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:18,920
you have got rid of all those particles with low weights OK so it's really

1051
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,670
very simple idea

1052
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:22,070
now also

1053
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,420
if you look at it now

1054
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:30,870
we can see that the article is becoming a real mess because now seen

1055
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,330
everything we've done

1056
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:33,760
was such that

1057
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:42,020
the particle we writing where statistically independent all those guys with independent samples from q

1058
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:47,150
OK that's all but now you have been we have in case where you resample

1059
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:48,590
n times from this

1060
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:51,700
so at this level

1061
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:58,280
the particles are not independent anymore this new resampled particles because it for this new

1062
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:04,090
particles denoted should be next this new particle this was sampled particle it's true that

1063
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:08,760
you can add xt that i which is equal to xt that g four different

1064
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,620
from g

1065
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:11,520
OK so particles

1066
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:16,480
if there are no more statistically independent case so i don't think it's becoming much

1067
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,950
more difficult to study because you can forget about all this time that limit to

1068
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,750
but never mind we can still do something

1069
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:28,930
what does it do graphically

1070
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,090
and that she was acquired graphical or they should but

1071
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:40,590
the that actually so remember what we are doing assume for example you interesting in

1072
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:45,000
approximating this guy using your importance distribution

1073
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,930
so you would sample n particles

1074
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:51,140
according to sample according to an importance distribution

1075
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:55,560
then you with the reweights each of those guys according

1076
01:11:56,170 --> 01:12:00,550
the weight which is proportional to p of q

1077
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:05,640
and then what you're doing is that now you have a weighted sum of the

1078
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:11,590
mass on the resampling operation simply consists of sampling capital ten times

1079
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:12,620
and these

1080
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:20,130
weighted empirical measure to obtain capital and new particles which which all have the same

1081
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:22,030
weight equal to one and

1082
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,810
OK obviously

1083
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:30,030
basically this guy for example it has multiple copy so you see i put it

1084
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:34,330
kind of as a bit bored but is actually simply because this article has been

1085
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:36,860
copied multiple times

1086
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:41,060
that's it now if you look at the resampling thing

1087
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:43,270
OK so it's the kind of

1088
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:48,380
way to focus your computational really falls in the right region of the state space

1089
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:50,100
but clearly

1090
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:54,650
what you should be clear about is that if the importance sampling was bad

1091
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:58,420
it is not going to get any better OK because these

1092
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:04,100
and can way something approximation if you think about it it just introduce additional notes

1093
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:06,810
the fact that for example

1094
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:11,040
the dead sea on the twenty right my my good by my my importance sampling

1095
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:15,700
approximation if the sampling it doesn't get any better than this is to keep that

1096
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,680
in mind the key

1097
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:25,060
well of particle mid-atlantic ontological calorimeters to come up with clever importance distribution you can

1098
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:30,900
to kind of overcome the the ambiguity that we have from the column

1099
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,750
now i don't know what the organisers thing but i think it might be a

1100
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:38,480
good idea to give you a three three-minute break at this point because it's like

1101
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:41,880
you know can any human really concentrate for an hour and a half

1102
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:48,790
you know you could stand up to hug your neighbour do a handstand or wheel

1103
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:51,330
and then we start again three minutes

1104
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:52,330
OK so

1105
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,850
now i want to think about

1106
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:56,080
how are going to deal with this

1107
01:13:56,100 --> 01:14:01,740
the idea of making joint decisions and to exploit the fact that the objects that

1108
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:07,150
with segmenting here are expected to be to possess some coherence it would be very

1109
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:15,360
surprising if adjacent pixels very often had different labels that his for foreground versus background

1110
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:20,000
you really wouldn't expect to see a chess board of foreground background labels you know

1111
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,620
the brown squares being foreground white squares being background that would really be go

1112
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:29,360
counter to what you what you know about the natural world and the the typical

1113
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,810
properties of objects in the natural world so

1114
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:33,880
you know we'd like to

1115
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,540
link up the decisions between

1116
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,400
and so

1117
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:43,290
when making a decision about this big so here

1118
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:45,500
will be good to refer to

1119
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,310
you really quite a lot of the pixels in the image maybe over quite can

1120
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:54,520
some considerable difference distance because the degree of correlation about object identity is likely to

1121
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:59,040
be rather large in the image and if you can delivery took a picture of

1122
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:02,880
of an object and very likely that object filled a large proportion of the image

1123
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,580
in maybe half the image in which case you know is it going to be

1124
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:10,480
necessary to communicate over half of the diameter of the image because that really is

1125
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:15,480
an awful lot of a little north of communication of of pixels so

1126
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:18,190
you know potentially

1127
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:19,850
you know if there are a million

1128
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:25,100
pixels in the image then there might be a million million connections to make you

1129
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:28,520
know perhaps not by that many but order of order of a million million connections

1130
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,040
and that is not going to be practical we can do a thousand million things

1131
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:35,020
in the second on the computer a million million things is going to take a

1132
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:38,920
thousand seconds sounds like we have to do a lot better than that

1133
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:39,920
and so

1134
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:46,310
what i want to talk about is how to exploit markov models to do this

1135
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:49,270
much more effectively and

1136
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:53,130
i guess you may have had to have been lectures lectures on markov chains and

1137
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:56,210
markov you know how much is being

1138
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:59,480
my model so you know i can go through the next few slides like movie

1139
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:03,480
and it'll just you know excite memories that have already been laid down in your

1140
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:09,350
brain from from previous lectures and but you know my first movie is in the

1141
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:14,130
first order markov chain you know the simplest model model anybody knows attacks briggs example

1142
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:19,620
the weather today condition on the weather yesterday it's not so funny actually the you

1143
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:24,750
know two kinds of weather in britain there's this kind of this kind and

1144
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:30,830
and you know you make a little two by two matrix for the conditional probabilities

1145
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:35,170
of the state today condition on the state yesterday OK i can i can run

1146
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:38,270
through this contact and then when i want to do

1147
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:42,580
the state today conditional state say two days ago do i make a new mark

1148
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:48,670
of you know new conditional matrix probably makes for that no what i do is

1149
01:16:48,690 --> 01:16:53,650
just use the same model assuming some translation invariance through time and just drop the

1150
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:59,150
same car conditional probabilities down between tuesday and wednesday in the same again between monday

1151
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:01,960
and tuesday in each one is two by two matrices and i raise the two

1152
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:05,960
by two matrices to the cube to the for power because multiply this one by

1153
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:09,480
this one by this one and now i've got the correlation of thursday with respect

1154
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:10,190
to monday

1155
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:14,330
OK this is i'm reliably informed by zubin is all trivial to you guys

1156
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:20,500
and you know the second order markov model predictive text here is that goes in

1157
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:24,180
practice predictive text can needs to go back to tokens not just one token to

1158
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:29,850
actually get anywhere close to kind of superficial model of a vertex so now if

1159
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:33,230
you want to generate city sentences at random i guess you've all done this kind

1160
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:33,850
of thing

1161
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:39,250
you started off with three words on the two guess enough and then you draw

1162
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:42,960
around from the third world word from your

1163
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,170
dictionary of probable you get the city the city random sensors this is simulating the

1164
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:53,810
try try word model of speech they can protect small

1165
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:59,080
and you know you have to dash of if you had dasher

1166
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:04,150
yes you know better is all about exploiting rather beautiful way these kinds models

1167
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:08,900
and in speech they use these kinds of

1168
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,880
they use markov models in

1169
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:15,980
i guess basically similar way but of course the the tokens in the markov model

1170
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:20,790
are not words not because you know life is not that simple you have examining

1171
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:24,380
a signal like this one and trying to decide what the word is so a

1172
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:28,710
typical word model consist of a series of states which are just kind of time

1173
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:32,420
like phases of the progression through the word and so

1174
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:35,820
then we have a job is serialized object which is in the payload

1175
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:41,950
to carry both i code in our data

1176
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,790
OK now talk about the security framework

1177
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:52,040
first of all a few points to make his security in general was

1178
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,680
never solved problems

1179
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:59,660
does have a well defined framework in which the

1180
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:01,930
holes or

1181
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:08,680
aspects that relate to security are laid out in the final

1182
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:12,710
and we'll discuss the framework

1183
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:16,810
the document is called security architecture for active networks

1184
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:21,500
it's a working group to draft document sandy murphy NAI labs

1185
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:23,150
maintains it

1186
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,660
there has been maintaining it

1187
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:26,300
and there's

1188
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,210
information on the mailing list

1189
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,710
if you want to get it

1190
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:35,940
was that was on the level abstractions obviously there's no security policies

1191
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:40,450
there subjects which act on objects and their the actions which take place

1192
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,920
if you go to RFC twenty eight twenty eight no legacy

1193
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,430
IP document

1194
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:47,800
they define different types of attacks

1195
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,540
unauthorized disclosure

1196
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:51,100
deception disruption

1197
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,140
usurpation of assets

1198
01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:56,510
but in an act what changes and active network is we have our own

1199
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,260
different types of assets now

1200
01:19:58,270 --> 01:20:00,060
with our new paradigm

1201
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,690
there's obviously the node

1202
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:03,720
his execution environment

1203
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:08,040
the person sending the package and there's the active code

1204
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,210
travelling through the and and modifying

1205
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:14,850
the operation of the network

1206
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:18,850
so if we take these assets and look at how one can

1207
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:20,930
impact the other

1208
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:25,330
this is just kind of i don't threat table here

1209
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:27,710
so this column

1210
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:29,210
can see threats from

1211
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:31,140
these columns over here

1212
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:33,700
yes meaning yes you consider threat

1213
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,150
you have the code

1214
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:41,330
from one active application could try to interfere with code from other active application if

1215
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:42,720
there were no

1216
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:47,370
security or resource bounds in place

1217
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:51,360
but to take that a step further the framework has looked at the state of

1218
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,020
where we are now

1219
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:55,250
in terms of protection

1220
01:20:55,290 --> 01:21:00,020
so again if these folks in this column

1221
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:05,990
we try to indicate how well they can be protected from components in this column

1222
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:07,650
and the not really is

1223
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:11,130
indicate current research is still going on in that area

1224
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:12,070
for example

1225
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:15,160
we start getting down to the EU especially the note

1226
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:19,220
if the node is corrupt he can pretty much do anything you want to

1227
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,860
to anybody that's flowing through

1228
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:24,940
whereas one EE e

1229
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,050
the node can enforce pounds on one EE e

1230
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:33,900
interfering with another he e

1231
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:36,530
so if we look at the steps in the life of an active packet they

1232
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,170
relate to security

1233
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:42,280
we can see these these steps going on OK so starting with the packet being

1234
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,990
received at the node

1235
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:47,760
hop by hop key identifiers taken from the package

1236
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,810
they just in denote

1237
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,200
and it's integrity cheque

1238
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:57,890
to make sure that the package is OK if it fails the packet simply dropped

1239
01:21:57,890 --> 01:22:03,370
next we have to know which either the package is going to go towards

1240
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:05,690
or to be executed with in

1241
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,260
and remember we have the channel so the

1242
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:09,310
to do that

1243
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:12,800
so the main filters applied to find out which domain and therefore which channel the

1244
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:15,910
the packet is assigned to

1245
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:21,310
within the end up options credentials can be placed

1246
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:25,920
and the credentials there can be multiple credentials to allow

1247
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,960
activity for the code to do

1248
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:30,190
various predefined

1249
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:33,990
so these credentials have to be verified

1250
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:37,160
and the way the framework is defined now

1251
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:42,120
if a section if one of the potentials fails that

1252
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:43,770
that event

1253
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:44,900
can not occur

1254
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:47,210
however all the credentials which passed

1255
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:48,700
those events can still

1256
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:51,740
still have to go on to the package even though some credentials failed the package

1257
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:52,910
can still go through

1258
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,700
and continue

1259
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,380
twenty four hundred metres

1260
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,640
the pressure is three-quarters of an atmosphere

1261
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,800
according to this equation

1262
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:07,470
water doesn't boil there on the degree centigrade here at sea level it does

1263
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:11,610
but it three-quarters of an atmosphere boils at more than ninety two degrees centigrade so

1264
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:13,220
you can never time

1265
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:17,320
you get a soft-boiled egg you can have time to properly because you used a

1266
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:20,620
hundred degrees centigrade effect the kitchen their tables

1267
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,660
which indicated how long you would have to borrow potatoes

1268
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:25,260
get and what you want to

1269
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:29,410
ninety degrees centigrade that's all you can get you can go in high

1270
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:32,050
mount everest whatever

1271
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:36,160
seventy two degrees centigrade there's no way you can get yourself there's some real hot

1272
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,950
food so will pressure-cooker there of course

1273
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:41,700
if you go to thirty kilometres altitude

1274
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:44,450
you asked this equation with the pressure is this one

1275
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:49,030
f of an atmosphere twenty seventeen millimetres mercury

1276
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:52,430
water at twenty degrees centigrade would boil

1277
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:55,140
at that altitude

1278
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,360
i want to show you the phase diagram

1279
01:23:57,410 --> 01:24:05,090
of what

1280
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:10,970
this is the phase diagram of water

1281
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:12,800
and what i want to do

1282
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,510
is i want to

1283
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:15,990
take some water

1284
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:18,030
and bring to an altitude

1285
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:20,490
of about

1286
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:22,380
thirty kilometres

1287
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:24,410
thirty kilometres

1288
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:30,530
twenty degrees centigrade should start to boil

1289
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:32,470
how do i know that

1290
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:35,140
this is the phase diagram for water

1291
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:38,910
zero degrees centigrade on the degrees centigrade

1292
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:40,260
this is pressure in

1293
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:42,140
millimetres mercury

1294
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,990
the scales are not very clear

1295
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,410
o we have

1296
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:50,950
they a forty from the web form

1297
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:53,820
if you

1298
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:55,510
take twenty

1299
01:24:55,530 --> 01:24:57,360
degree somewhere here

1300
01:24:57,410 --> 01:24:59,120
and you have water

1301
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,660
at one atmospheres

1302
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,990
and twenty degrees which is what we have in this room

1303
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:06,680
and i'm going to

1304
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,860
a lot of pressure on it's going to put in the bell jar there

1305
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,910
i'm going to take all the air out of the pressure goes down and down

1306
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:13,950
and down

1307
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:15,970
but the temperature is not changing

1308
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:17,030
you go down

1309
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:18,410
in the liquid

1310
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,550
these liquids

1311
01:25:20,570 --> 01:25:21,910
they liquid

1312
01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:23,340
this liquid

1313
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:26,470
this liquid until you reach this point

1314
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:28,050
and then

1315
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:31,780
you have coexistence between the gas and liquid called the paper in the case of

1316
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:36,860
and and that means it will start to world

1317
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:39,140
and that happens

1318
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,840
looked up

1319
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:45,590
at the pressure of about seventy millimetres mercury which is equivalent to thirty kilometers altitude

1320
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:50,340
so we have here some water

1321
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:55,490
forty here

1322
01:25:55,550 --> 01:26:00,800
when the bell jar

1323
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:02,950
this is a

1324
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:04,700
nine teams

1325
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,780
century vintage

1326
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:08,610
of the bell jar

1327
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:10,030
very slow

1328
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:14,880
i will take at least five minutes before we reach that low pressure

1329
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:16,220
you see here

1330
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:23,120
the wine glass

1331
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,340
it is

1332
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:26,800
and we'll keep an eye on it on and off

1333
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:28,680
so when it starts to borrow

1334
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,070
i can even read the pressure

1335
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:33,970
that's not so important i want you to appreciate the fact that if you have

1336
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:35,780
long enough

1337
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:37,430
through the line

1338
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:38,470
we're gas

1339
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:41,410
and liquid and coexist with each other

1340
01:26:41,490 --> 01:26:43,260
that is our definition

1341
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,660
warning so let me start the

1342
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,070
one thing

1343
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,660
and in the meantime

1344
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:58,110
polynomial just as transformation you can basically you can eliminate this guy and put it

1345
01:26:58,110 --> 01:27:00,310
up into the objective

1346
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:04,270
to symbol manipulation basically

1347
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:06,850
this is being minimized so

1348
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:10,950
this is being minimized so the minimum what happens is this

1349
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,990
because if you move this so there

1350
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:17,480
this is going to be exactly equal to that site so we can eliminate the

1351
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,270
slack by just putting it

1352
01:27:19,290 --> 01:27:21,400
like that

1353
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:25,870
so this is the discovered the cleanest formulation of

1354
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:28,910
the problem is in my eyes norm

1355
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:31,240
this thing

1356
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:33,990
which is essentially a year

1357
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:36,160
hinge loss and

1358
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:39,060
the constraints in london

1359
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:40,950
then in force

1360
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:44,500
this amounts to one

1361
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:45,820
the question yes

1362
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:58,250
what about the method is use

1363
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,160
could see

1364
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,400
and she

1365
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,870
did not same user

1366
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:16,240
they're not the same as

1367
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,610
well OK

1368
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:22,130
sure sold a little bit like the alphas in this in this but there are

1369
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,660
going to be

1370
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:26,690
much less sparse

1371
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:32,810
continuous so so so for their somewhat sparse

1372
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:38,390
you know

1373
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:40,570
so all

1374
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:44,600
there are

1375
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:52,330
sure so the concentration cell talk about that this is

1376
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:56,450
it is important so to that being

1377
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:00,450
OK so i slides but later but that would be sort of a greedy approach

1378
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:05,570
where you just basically have occurred w

1379
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:10,850
if you do the max and you add in the constraint writers constraint generation you

1380
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:15,700
know column generation is latin for is a bundle methods this is

1381
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:19,610
also related to that so that i mean that's an approximate method the problem is

1382
01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:21,790
we keep re solving this QP

1383
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:27,390
multiple times and people have suggested this is exactly what thomas hoffmann and his students

1384
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:29,790
did and so on and so

1385
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:31,990
it's a feasible method is just

1386
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:37,460
i think it's much slower we much slower and you know if we

1387
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,450
the goal of this was to write the entire problems

1388
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,740
in a polynomial form and then you have

1389
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,280
all kinds of options

1390
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:48,360
try to solve it right so when you have discontinuation you're sort of stuck to

1391
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:51,990
one approach when you just write down the whole thing explicitly

1392
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,200
and small

1393
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:58,100
you can use second order methods you know you can use MEX three can use

1394
01:29:58,110 --> 01:30:03,070
whatever interior point methods to solid fast et cetera et cetera so so there's advantage

1395
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:07,270
of reading the entire thing declaratively as a small

1396
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,980
programme because then

1397
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:11,870
now you can

1398
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:15,990
used entire toolbox as opposed to sticking to particular method

1399
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:19,150
from the beginning so that's advantage and

1400
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:27,130
so this is busy this this form of the the kind of done right so

1401
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:30,320
all you have to do we have a structure problem you write down the LP

1402
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,270
for it

1403
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,890
take the dual

1404
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,440
me this qpis to get into only

1405
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:40,250
you know a mosaic

1406
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:42,150
or c plex or

1407
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:44,150
what are your favourite optimizer is

1408
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:46,670
and you don't you don't need to write any more

1409
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:49,710
could really just need to

1410
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:53,060
the second feature functions right down the LP take all

1411
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:58,160
and the problem solver idea general kind of toolbox

1412
01:30:58,170 --> 01:31:03,390
like like simplex or music that will solve structured prediction problems for you

1413
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,920
same principle

1414
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:09,540
a clear

1415
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:13,170
so in practice of course you want methods that actually

1416
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:18,150
optimized for particular structure much better and something that i worked on

1417
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:21,900
quite a lot is trying to exploit the structure and this QP

1418
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:27,530
to do this so these things faster than off the shelf optimisers does but but

1419
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:33,240
the the convenience in high in being able to write something down declaratively and not

1420
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:36,890
the only algorithm we know the runs in less than n log n time

1421
01:31:36,910 --> 01:31:39,640
counting sort so we better use that one

1422
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:44,260
sort of bootstrapping get an even faster more general could

1423
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:49,580
just erased

1424
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,020
the running time counting sort

1425
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:59,060
in order k plus and

1426
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:01,140
remember that

1427
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:03,720
in the range of the numbers is one to k

1428
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:06,490
or zero became minus one

1429
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:11,080
so we can when we when we sort by particular digit we should use an

1430
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:15,020
organ algorithm because that then this thing will take an organ for one round is

1431
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:17,720
going have multiple rounds is going to be worse than organ

1432
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:20,020
so we're use counting sort

1433
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:22,760
in each round

1434
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:33,740
counting sort each digit

1435
01:32:33,870 --> 01:32:42,720
and we know the running time of counting sort here is order k plus and

1436
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:45,520
OK but

1437
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,450
i don't want to assume that my integers are split into digits for me

1438
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:50,470
that's sort of

1439
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:52,770
giving away too much flexibility

1440
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:57,200
because if i have some numbering in whatever form it is probably written in binary

1441
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:00,910
i can cluster together some of those bits and call that a digital

1442
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:06,200
so let's think of our numbers in binary so suppose we have n integers

1443
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:11,910
and there some range and we want to know how big arranged they can be

1444
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:17,080
so let's say practical

1445
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:20,830
way of thinking

1446
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:24,640
you know we're we're in a binary world so that's so each integers b bits

1447
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:27,720
in other words the range

1448
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:30,770
from zero

1449
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:32,120
to be

1450
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:34,390
find someone else in my numbers are

1451
01:33:34,410 --> 01:33:37,560
nonnegative doesn't make much difference if the negative here

1452
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:41,810
OK so i want to know how they could be i can handle

1453
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:43,950
but i don't want to split into

1454
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:48,580
let's think about i don't want to split into

1455
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:50,390
bits as my digits

1456
01:33:50,410 --> 01:33:51,930
because i would have to be

1457
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:56,450
and i would have to do the rounds of the sound of the number of

1458
01:33:56,450 --> 01:34:01,760
rounds this album is the number of digits that i have each one cost me

1459
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:03,680
let's hope for linear time

1460
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:04,890
and indeed

1461
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:10,520
if i use a single bit k is too so this is the order

1462
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:14,080
but then the running time would be order and per around and then

1463
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:16,020
there are b digits

1464
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:19,370
i consider them to be bits those or and times b

1465
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:24,580
and even if b is something small like log n if five log n bits

1466
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:28,410
them these are numbers between zero and minus one already know how to sort numbers

1467
01:34:28,410 --> 01:34:32,830
between zero and ten minus one in linear time here spending on log n time

1468
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:34,580
so that's no good

1469
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,220
instead what we're going to do is take a bunch of bits and call that

1470
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,140
a digital

1471
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:42,580
it is the most basic we can handle was counting sort

1472
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:44,740
so the notation would be

1473
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:47,140
split each and integer

1474
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:50,560
in two the over are

1475
01:34:57,470 --> 01:34:58,740
are bits long

1476
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:06,970
other words i think of my number is being in base two dr

1477
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:12,790
and i happen to be writing it down in binary but cluster together are bits

1478
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:16,930
i get a bunch of digits in base on the

1479
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:19,160
and then there be over digits

1480
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:21,020
OK so this be over are

1481
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,220
is the number of rounds

1482
01:35:25,330 --> 01:35:29,600
and this base this is the maximum value i have in one of these agencies

1483
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:34,330
between zero and two the are so this is in some sense the k

1484
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:38,200
four around a round of counting sort

1485
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:44,950
OK so

1486
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:51,310
what is the running time i have the over all rounds

1487
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,100
so be or are

1488
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:59,850
sometimes the running time for rounds which i have and numbers

1489
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,680
my value of k is to the are

1490
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:07,700
this is what i read this is the running time of counting sort on this

1491
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:10,990
this is the number of rounds

1492
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:12,850
so this is you are

1493
01:36:12,870 --> 01:36:17,480
times and lost two to the are

1494
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:23,860
and i am free to choose are however what

1495
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:25,940
so what i'd like to do

1496
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:27,480
is minimized

1497
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:28,640
this run time

1498
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:32,030
over my choices of are

1499
01:36:32,070 --> 01:36:36,910
so any suggestions on how i might find the minimal running time over all traces

1500
01:36:36,910 --> 01:36:38,720
of or

1501
01:36:38,730 --> 01:36:41,760
techniques not necessarily solutions

1502
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:54,480
so when i say this because its asymptotic but forget the big over here

1503
01:36:54,490 --> 01:36:58,940
how do i minimize the function with respect to one variable

1504
01:36:58,990 --> 01:37:03,470
take the derivative so i could take the derivative of this function

1505
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:07,720
by are differentiated by are set to the equal to zero

1506
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:10,530
and that should be a critical point in this function it turns out this function

1507
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:11,930
uni modal and are

1508
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:14,540
and you will find the minimum

1509
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:17,610
so we could do that i'm not going to do it because it's

1510
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:19,860
it's a little bit more work you should try to home

1511
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:23,470
and that the group velocity is the omega dk

1512
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:24,640
and so

1513
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:27,470
there there's no such thing as one phase velocity

1514
01:37:27,490 --> 01:37:32,470
for non dispersive medium there's no such thing as one group velocity it depends on

1515
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:34,840
the curve only covers this case

1516
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:38,300
so you have to know what we call the dispersion relation

1517
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:43,490
in order to stable to phase velocities for what frequency

1518
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:48,390
and this person is extremely common in physics

1519
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:51,970
if we take deep waterways

1520
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:56,260
the water waves

1521
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:01,530
i would imagine that what is meant by that is that

1522
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:03,970
water is deeper

1523
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:08,340
the length of your wavelength that is probably the

1524
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:11,030
operational definition

1525
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:12,430
it's very

1526
01:38:12,430 --> 01:38:14,030
this process

1527
01:38:14,050 --> 01:38:15,950
the dispersion relation which

1528
01:38:15,970 --> 01:38:18,660
i will not arrive

1529
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:21,030
i didn't arrive at you for the strange

1530
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:23,140
omega square

1531
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,280
equals gk

1532
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:28,970
is just the gravitational acceleration

1533
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:30,590
please as

1534
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,120
divided by rho

1535
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:36,090
times k two to power three

1536
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:37,510
and as

1537
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:40,990
it is the surface tension

1538
01:38:40,990 --> 01:38:42,740
which is full water

1539
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:45,510
about one point o seven two

1540
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:48,090
four meter

1541
01:38:48,110 --> 01:38:51,240
i don't know whether you've dealt with surface tension into one

1542
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:54,450
if not you just can accept this as

1543
01:38:54,450 --> 01:38:58,430
and the density of water row

1544
01:38:58,450 --> 01:39:00,450
is about a thousand

1545
01:39:00,490 --> 01:39:02,840
kilograms per cubic metre

1546
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:05,990
of course is a little different for seawater that

1547
01:39:06,010 --> 01:39:09,990
nice number sort of tool to use

1548
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:13,510
now this ester is only important

1549
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:17,110
four very short wavelengths

1550
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,590
if you take the case that land on

1551
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:24,050
is much much larger than one centimeter

1552
01:39:24,110 --> 01:39:26,300
then i can show you that the astronomers

1553
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:36,010
so let's take lambda equals one leader

1554
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:38,070
like that is one meter

1555
01:39:38,090 --> 01:39:41,590
and k is two pi divided by line that you can calculate

1556
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:50,260
about sixty two in as i units because g is nine point eight

1557
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:52,390
and you can also calculate now

1558
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:54,890
s divided by road

1559
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:57,340
times k two third

1560
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,860
remember case two pi divided by that

1561
01:39:59,890 --> 01:40:00,950
and this now

1562
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:03,610
is point zero two

1563
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:09,070
very small

1564
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:16,260
so for this case you might as well before first first order approximation forget that

1565
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:19,070
so you can write down now that omega

1566
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,450
divided by k

1567
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:25,990
which is the phase velocity

1568
01:40:26,030 --> 01:40:27,700
in this case

1569
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:30,530
comes out to be one point two five meters per second

1570
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:35,010
the the

1571
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:37,680
and what you also find and i will show you that

1572
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:40,490
very shortly that the group velocity

1573
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:43,010
is half the phase velocity

1574
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:46,140
and so is half this value

1575
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:48,660
and if you want to know what frequency

1576
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:51,640
one is hopping up and down

1577
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:53,590
the frequency of course is the

1578
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:57,240
the phase velocity divided by lambda

1579
01:40:57,260 --> 01:41:01,070
that is about one point two five hertz

1580
01:41:01,110 --> 01:41:11,160
so it's a little faster than one oscillations per second

1581
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:15,700
if we have the case the latter is much larger than one centimetre

1582
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:17,860
i will continue here

1583
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:20,260
the lambda is much much larger

1584
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:21,760
and one either

1585
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:23,090
i can use the

1586
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:25,740
the dispersion relation

1587
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:30,280
and i can calculate now with the phase velocity and group velocity is in general

1588
01:41:31,590 --> 01:41:33,340
so i know now that omega

1589
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,510
to high degree of approximation

1590
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:38,010
is the square root of g k

1591
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:41,610
i forget the ester

1592
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:44,820
and so we got divided by k

1593
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:48,070
which is the phase velocity

1594
01:41:48,090 --> 01:41:51,300
it is therefore description of g

1595
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:54,510
divided by k

1596
01:41:54,590 --> 01:41:56,010
we agree

1597
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:57,260
and notice

1598
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:59,050
that this is

1599
01:41:59,070 --> 01:42:00,890
therefore proportional

1600
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:03,490
due to square root of the wavelength

1601
01:42:03,530 --> 01:42:05,840
because one of k

1602
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:12,340
so what it means is that the larger the wavelengths

1603
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:14,640
the higher the phase velocity

1604
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:19,800
let larger k smaller the higher the faithful

1605
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:22,680
what now is the group velocity

1606
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:27,410
the group velocity is the only god came

1607
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:30,360
so you take this one then you take the derivative

1608
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:33,590
of the square root of j g times k

1609
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:36,240
so you first get you one half

1610
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:38,930
and then you get your square root of g but now we have to divide

1611
01:42:38,930 --> 01:42:40,910
by the square root of k

1612
01:42:40,930 --> 01:42:44,410
so you get a times square root of g over k

1613
01:42:44,470 --> 01:42:48,070
but the square root of g over cables the phase velocity so is half the

1614
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:49,590
phase velocity

1615
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,660
that's what i

1616
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:57,910
already anticipated here

1617
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:58,990
so for me

1618
01:42:58,990 --> 01:43:03,220
one way in which are much larger than one centimetre

1619
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:05,010
you see that

1620
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:06,760
the higher

1621
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:11,510
the lost city

1622
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:12,470
the larger

1623
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:14,410
the waif-like

1624
01:43:14,490 --> 01:43:19,280
and you also see that the group velocity is half the phase velocity

1625
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:21,390
let's now take the situation

1626
01:43:21,390 --> 01:43:22,760
that lambda

1627
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,610
it's a much smaller than one centimeter doesn't even have to be all that much

1628
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:30,990
just smaller than one centimeter

1629
01:43:30,990 --> 01:43:33,410
then it's the second term

1630
01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:35,930
that completely dominates

1631
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:38,340
so now you get that omega square

1632
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:41,720
there were very good approximation is as

1633
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,070
divided by rho

1634
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:45,820
times k two the third

1635
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:47,860
so now the phase velocity

1636
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:52,930
which is only god divided by k

1637
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:55,890
is now describe wrote

1638
01:43:55,890 --> 01:43:58,130
the second

1639
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:33,340
all of

1640
01:44:39,610 --> 01:44:42,830
three role hundred

1641
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:47,560
they are

1642
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:19,120
after the war

1643
01:46:47,530 --> 01:46:49,170
for each

1644
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:02,690
and we will

1645
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:16,930
prior to

1646
01:48:00,610 --> 01:48:10,060
you might want

1647
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:18,610
for all

1648
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:24,100
there are one or

1649
01:48:24,230 --> 01:48:26,590
this more

1650
01:48:26,650 --> 01:48:34,110
the same problem for that

1651
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:51,120
u s

1652
01:48:55,360 --> 01:49:04,610
this is more probable on

1653
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:33,410
there are two

1654
01:49:40,690 --> 01:49:59,490
one is

1655
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:10,270
the problem

1656
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:15,780
alright which

1657
01:50:54,100 --> 01:51:01,110
i think

1658
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,840
the graph

1659
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:23,930
these of of the

1660
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:31,380
there are no

1661
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:35,040
so o far

1662
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:42,020
what food is all about who has taught you what constitutes what's acceptable to eat

1663
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:44,150
what's good for us

1664
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:47,750
and there are a lot of interesting things that the food industry has trained us

1665
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:51,210
to believe that experts say may or may not be true

1666
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:56,230
because the product has the word fruit in its name

1667
01:51:56,290 --> 01:51:59,980
doesn't necessarily mean it actually has fruit in it

1668
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,750
now is that deceptive is misleading all these are very interesting questions

1669
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:10,590
and this causes i said well emphasise psychology biology

1670
01:52:10,610 --> 01:52:14,640
in politics of so let's talk about each one for just a moment

1671
01:52:14,690 --> 01:52:18,740
first of all what you choose to eat and what the world chooses the which

1672
01:52:18,740 --> 01:52:24,230
has enormous in fact impact on the public health on the vitality of countries and

1673
01:52:24,230 --> 01:52:29,010
even on world politics with the recent spike in food prices around the world that

1674
01:52:29,010 --> 01:52:35,230
you've all heard of because of rising energy costs the the corn ethanol conversion in

1675
01:52:35,230 --> 01:52:39,320
the united states and other things like that is really changed the world landscape and

1676
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:43,370
a lot of interesting ways that help some countries and her other countries but it

1677
01:52:43,370 --> 01:52:45,700
certainly has changed the food landscape

1678
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:50,540
so those are very important political factors this talk about psychology from any you guys

1679
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:52,570
have been trained by your culture

1680
01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:56,290
define what constitutes the flu

1681
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:59,100
and food is associated with feelings

1682
01:52:59,110 --> 01:53:02,600
some people only when they are stressed some people even more when they are stressed

1683
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:07,400
some people the less when they stressed some people eat for comfort some people get

1684
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:13,660
enormous psychological gratification from food other people couldn't care less they have to be reminded

1685
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:16,660
so what's the difference in there

1686
01:53:16,670 --> 01:53:19,230
now how many of you when this is gonna show of hands how many of

1687
01:53:19,230 --> 01:53:22,760
you would say you eat more when you're stressed

1688
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:25,640
and how many people would say you eat less

1689
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:29,400
OK looks like about a fairly even split was in which is interesting we've done

1690
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:33,280
some research on this in the past and found that men and women differ in

1691
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:37,590
response to question of course the level of stress matters and even the type of

1692
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:41,590
stress people are feeling is an academic stressed social stress and the like

1693
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:46,570
that depend that determines in part how people respond with reading so psychology is a

1694
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:47,760
big player here

1695
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,100
we like certain foods we have positive associations with them because of our families

1696
01:53:53,150 --> 01:53:57,710
in all these red and marketing of course all these factors come into play in

1697
01:53:57,710 --> 01:54:00,010
shaping how we feel about for

1698
01:54:00,030 --> 01:54:05,380
by biology biology is an obvious player how many of you would say that food

1699
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:09,110
can be addicted

1700
01:54:09,150 --> 01:54:13,910
maybe three quarters of EU law that's alot now actually the science on this is

1701
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:18,840
pretty new and very interesting we'll talk about that in the class but for those

1702
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:22,340
of you raise your hand and just tell me what do think what makes you

1703
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:24,250
believe food can be addictive

1704
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:26,590
somebody telling

1705
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:36,780
OK so withdraw always the possibility we food for long time and the you stop

1706
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:42,070
what's a high sugar diet or something and withdrawal symptoms occur will that might be

1707
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:47,190
the actions occurring well says ideas about that

1708
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:51,560
something else had and a lot of interesting reasons we've all heard the topic the

1709
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:56,680
word chocoholic sugar addict we hear the words withdrawal and things and that becomes an

1710
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:58,850
interesting part of the biology of

1711
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:03,980
but course food has this cascade of effects once it enters our body it starts

1712
01:55:03,980 --> 01:55:08,490
even before it goes in our mouth we sense for coming in that sets in

1713
01:55:08,490 --> 01:55:13,450
the year series of metabolic and biological processes that are very interesting and then of

1714
01:55:13,450 --> 01:55:17,720
course once the food gets in the body there's lots of interesting things some good

1715
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:21,960
things and some bad things and so we'll talk about what people are eating we'll

1716
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:27,160
talk about what's good and what's not good and with the optimal diet might be

1717
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:31,000
so are a few the topics that will be discussed in the class first we'll

1718
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,550
talk about what you need and why

1719
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,760
and what the world needs and why

1720
01:55:35,770 --> 01:55:39,650
how much is psychology how much is biology how much of it is world politics

1721
01:55:39,660 --> 01:55:45,410
all these things are very important players so we'll talk about this and then discuss

1722
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:50,400
what what sort of things are shaping your diet but also the world's style and

1723
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:54,170
the reasons behind the we'll talk about whether food could be addictive as i mentioned

1724
01:55:54,170 --> 01:55:58,340
just a moment ago we'll talk about whether for and promote health of course you

1725
01:55:58,350 --> 01:56:00,390
can if if done right

1726
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:04,180
i will talk about the specific properties of food that promote good health and what

1727
01:56:04,180 --> 01:56:10,490
can be done to increase the opportunity of food to improve the public health international

1728
01:56:10,490 --> 01:56:12,160
an international way

1729
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:16,150
will also discuss what we perceive food to be

1730
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:19,890
and what we perceive is promoting health and that may be quite different than what

1731
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:21,780
actually promotes health

1732
01:56:21,830 --> 01:56:28,210
are trans-fats battery trans-fats good for food never had transferred in it but it gets

1733
01:56:28,210 --> 01:56:33,360
labeled as having no trans fat that increase your perception of how good their food

1734
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:34,560
is for you

1735
01:56:34,580 --> 01:56:37,300
and so the perception is really important here

1736
01:56:37,310 --> 01:56:40,180
will talk about genetically modified foods

1737
01:56:40,290 --> 01:56:43,670
if any of you who have come from europe will care alot more about this

1738
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:46,420
issue in all likelihood than the americans

1739
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:51,350
because it's been of much harder topic in europe european governments have taken stronger action

1740
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:57,120
our good way of combining the prob is a good way to explain it

1741
01:56:58,340 --> 01:56:59,630
get some

1742
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:02,940
some reasonable classifiers for example

1743
01:57:02,950 --> 01:57:05,320
the regularized fisher discriminant

1744
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:09,880
regularisation is important as i said that we go to the paradigm

1745
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:14,770
celebrate already and i'll go through several paradigms

1746
01:57:17,110 --> 01:57:25,190
well i mean there's there's different positions where this is possible and

1747
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:28,460
i think it depends very much on the type of artifact

1748
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:33,110
so there that this very simple things like you would like to know what other

1749
01:57:33,110 --> 01:57:34,460
bridges between

1750
01:57:34,510 --> 01:57:37,600
the electrodes because they measure the same thing

1751
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:42,550
because this conductance between them and then you get some singularities

1752
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:47,600
and so on so forth so so we have this different stages that you can

1753
01:57:47,610 --> 01:57:57,160
well so if we do RCA a it was on the walls

1754
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:00,710
OK so

1755
01:58:00,790 --> 01:58:05,100
i mean this is the problem in this is it's it's somewhat also in engineering

1756
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:10,370
problem so we we have to find for certain subject we have to find a

1757
01:58:10,370 --> 01:58:11,820
good and

1758
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:14,610
robust way of

1759
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:19,480
you getting this whole thing to work was the subject might mean that we just

1760
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:23,530
made all these these kind of features because it does it's of no use as

1761
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:26,370
as shown on the on the

1762
01:58:26,380 --> 01:58:28,860
comparison sometimes black box

1763
01:58:28,870 --> 01:58:32,700
with the game that you can get is is very low for some subjects so

1764
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:37,300
we really bother using those and you would use ESP only

1765
01:58:39,260 --> 01:58:42,800
so the bottom line i think is is after

1766
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:44,630
these twenty minutes

1767
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:51,220
we go through a protocol which allows us to to get these individual spatial temporal

1768
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:57,640
filters and so on so forth and already after having only two blocks we we

1769
01:58:57,640 --> 01:59:01,640
we try to see you know what kind of subjects this is and maybe some

1770
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:07,550
occasionally we can we can say after two blocks that this is an illiterate

1771
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:08,700
for BCI

1772
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:19,860
at this point it semi-automatic

1773
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:27,600
it's always you want to double-check so even though we have some means to do

1774
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:30,220
it fully automatic we don't

1775
01:59:30,260 --> 01:59:34,790
really do it because it's it makes some sense to to to double-check whether so

1776
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:39,150
to say the physics of the physiology is correct

1777
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:40,890
but i think

1778
01:59:40,980 --> 01:59:45,840
i mean i think this was remarked and also and we all i mean machine

1779
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:51,050
learning does not fully automated software that we give somebody we always have on

1780
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:53,130
you know

1781
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:57,540
point sort of points where we have to see and we we have to cheque

1782
01:59:57,540 --> 01:59:58,540
and interfere

1783
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:02,420
and it's the same hit i think the same way

1784
02:00:06,410 --> 02:00:07,790
so just

1785
02:00:07,810 --> 02:00:09,200
i would like to

1786
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:10,270
to have you

1787
02:00:10,290 --> 02:00:11,810
jointly with a little

1788
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:14,830
all the calibration session

1789
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:17,960
so this means relax

1790
02:00:19,930 --> 02:00:22,530
starting in a three to one second

1791
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:25,850
and when you see letter at you imagine

1792
02:00:25,870 --> 02:00:28,640
moving your right and left end

1793
02:00:28,660 --> 02:00:30,970
why the up

1794
02:00:31,010 --> 02:00:32,010
and then you stop

1795
02:00:32,020 --> 02:00:34,900
when the other is not there anymore

1796
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:38,010
OK so this is the random sequence

1797
02:00:38,060 --> 02:00:40,140
and it goes rather fast

1798
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:44,540
this real time

1799
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:47,690
should forget to relax

1800
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:55,300
this is the typical and you do this for twenty minutes

1801
02:00:55,310 --> 02:01:02,080
and i think this part is really the bore most boring part of the experiments

1802
02:01:02,110 --> 02:01:05,910
so i have a small children so when

1803
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,160
i had the

1804
02:01:07,170 --> 02:01:09,160
rough night

1805
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:13,040
when i sleep after the second block

1806
02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:19,570
so the data amount is is very limited i think the that the one of

1807
02:01:19,620 --> 02:01:23,670
one of the experiments i i've done maybe five experiments in my life and one

1808
02:01:23,670 --> 02:01:27,500
of the experiments i've done with only five minutes of data

1809
02:01:29,540 --> 02:01:35,490
well i mean i pay them postdoc salaries and

1810
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:40,880
and OK i mean it's something i mean we also have a journalist that come

1811
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:42,660
and they

1812
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:46,520
i just want to experience this and we don't pay them anything

1813
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:50,020
also some friends

1814
02:01:50,030 --> 02:01:50,870
for example
