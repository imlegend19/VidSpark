1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,590
the second sentence syria accused the united states on monday of carrying out a terrorist

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,140
aggression after a deadly raid near its border

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,280
with iraq which it said killed eight civilians so this was a sentence provides different

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,800
there's another sentence and you can see that there are

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:26,480
really more or less the same thing so they all formula that same killing

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,320
that many people that they called a terrorist aggression

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,970
so there's a lot of

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,970
sentences that's why we ended up would end up in one cluster so take several

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:43,320
seconds including one summary doesn't make sense because you would get rid of you repeat

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,810
this information is

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,560
no human would do if he or she were to summarise

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,610
the documents

13
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,860
but on the other hand you see that the

14
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,860
there are differences between them because they were coming from different sources which have different

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,760
information that possession so this is a certain words are

16
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,000
you need to

17
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:08,960
singles and the weights would have like this see which of come out or the

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,170
foreign minister

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,870
condemned those students

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,810
the president of what they have

21
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:21,460
and what you can also notice that you even if you decide which that there

22
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,500
are certain phrases words that you really don't need summary given that you want to

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,800
have something short

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,750
you can read it

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,750
ignore all get

26
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,560
white out set

27
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,230
parts they it said right before

28
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,800
where you got the information so given that you want to given the space is

29
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,380
limited you want to make sense short

30
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,920
what it means is that extractive summaries

31
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,610
then a human because and

32
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,530
some of the problems associated with extract with expected approaches to

33
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,970
they can bring pronounced which you don't know

34
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,270
and they that there a so-called

35
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,540
discourse connectives however then

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,480
would be impossible to interpret

37
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,160
once the context is no longer there so that the sentence beginning with however

38
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,070
if you put it in your summary this however just confused

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,000
so the question is whether anything can be done really

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,410
those problems from problems longer sentences similar sentences without

41
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,530
two abstractive association so

42
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,800
just to reiterate we have a problem

43
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,900
problem we want to do what we want to do in fact is to understand

44
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,260
documents generated summary this is that we cannot do not feel it's difficult many resources

45
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,080
but so the question is whether we can do is to modify the sentence is

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,450
not take a single units changed their structures

47
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,280
and there

48
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:08,090
tasks related to the first is also pressure and the second one is called suspension

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,460
so first expression would explain what is about

50
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,800
so it's summarisation on the sentence level

51
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,900
so for example we have sentence a slightly a leadership congratulates itself on a virtually

52
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,510
unprecedented exhibition of unity and moderation they should be aware that knives are being sharpened

53
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,680
at conservative central office to some seventy

54
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,090
news articles

55
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,040
so what you want to get the it's perhaps the shortest as labour regenerate itself

56
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,550
on unity mitford things happened at conservative central office

57
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,280
so basically the same thing

58
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,870
some words have been removed the g the sense of what the sentence is really

59
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,950
about is still there but this sentence is much

60
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,550
so there is the

61
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,510
and the world of course

62
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,810
you can also think that

63
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,770
so look totally different then to paraphrase but

64
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,960
both approaches they only part word

65
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,180
or phrase phrases

66
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,250
so i said one sentence pressure and used for a

67
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,520
personalization and other techniques

68
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,840
charles very interesting is called institution so it's about using information from different sentences in

69
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,670
a single one so for example here you have one to three four sentences

70
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,760
well first it's basically summarises what they all have articles

71
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,970
the US's highest court ruled by

72
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:40,290
forty five that there was gun ownership in chicago was unconstitutional

73
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:46,290
so what it means that which ruled out which prohibited two

74
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,330
use counts

75
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,390
the other three sentences they're about the same thing but a bit longer and provide

76
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,230
different information so even those four sentences with you

77
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,310
i would like to generate

78
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,620
is i showed us like this is important for us to spend that much in

79
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,910
the sentence can be longer than for example that happened monday or that they were

80
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,700
disbanding was twenty eight years old or that words

81
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,270
it that exist in chicago

82
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,660
and so on and so on

83
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,570
so what my point here is that

84
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,910
and so usually have similar sentences and then you

85
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,100
aggregate them together in a single one

86
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,580
and this is not valid

87
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,140
just by combining words or to syntactic structure

88
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,070
so but now the question

89
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,910
so the first identify which percent so can find out

90
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,280
which information is important and the second question is how to make sure we get

91
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,550
to the grammatical sentence

92
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:55,740
so for the first question even that have similar sentences that they overlap content and

93
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,260
you know that they come from different sources you can use the heuristic

94
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,550
if all

95
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,830
see all those images

96
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,920
agencies music

97
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,920
it's almost put

98
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,770
this information distance

99
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,490
for example about this that the the word than the phrase

100
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,070
then on issues that

101
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,810
it must be important for in this context right so the information is is repeated

102
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,070
in different sources that support information

103
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,020
on the other hand you can also look syntactic structures and

104
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:32,490
start the intuition that subject direct object are important in the main clause

105
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:40,170
more important than religion or non-religious and so is on the one hand this information

106
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,790
petitions and

107
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,550
look at the

108
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,330
syntactic structures and first

109
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,020
now after the second question

110
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,000
how can we guarantee that get something dramatic

111
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:58,480
you can use the language model so human language models gives you the ability of

112
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,020
given the background calls

113
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,800
so if you knew it something that has almost zero probability with respect to your

114
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,040
means that it's unlikely that this sentence is grammatical readable

115
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:16,090
but they also syntactic rules syntactic information to the user so for example english every

116
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,990
sentence every clause has to the subject

117
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:24,900
so this means that if you actually read something that doesn't the subject things

118
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,060
sean carroll

119
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,770
and now

120
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,840
so just the different

121
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,000
for which i will

122
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,250
use the data for example to use google news

123
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,600
so imagine the following

124
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,860
this method is to use compression it is that you can present not a single

125
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,760
standard separated and you do by finding

126
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,880
try to correct

127
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,290
this is a bit

128
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,990
probably unusual for machine learning

129
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,320
the planets

130
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,330
on the second we have joint

131
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:10,810
courses in artificial intelligence which feature of machine learning in logic

132
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,130
a very basic introduction to logic

133
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,000
machine learning

134
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,430
and mark this for would you

135
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,240
a basic introduction to to machine learning logic

136
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,500
but if you can

137
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,410
and yet hopefully will understand

138
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,600
the materials and artificial intelligence in the second

139
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,980
basically what i expect you to understand is just basic

140
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,920
understanding the concept of syntax

141
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,870
logic semantics

142
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,450
and maybe

143
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:51,210
at the least to parse logic form lecture

144
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,510
i will do some truth just to give you a flavour of what

145
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,150
all this proved methods working logic

146
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,090
and i expect to understand

147
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,230
and this

148
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,070
who have some background

149
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,340
this week

150
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,150
so as you get

151
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,090
get anywhere in undergraduate computer science

152
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,770
in have

153
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,700
so we have

154
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,370
everybody from computer science

155
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:30,090
i guess said the minimum you should be able to pass logic formula lecture

156
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,290
OK so why

157
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,150
this led to use computer science

158
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,480
so logic started as

159
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,670
and activity which formalized human reasoning

160
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,370
of the philosophers would disagree but taking an more

161
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,620
the pragmatic

162
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,980
you like

163
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,230
you know

164
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,600
here's i'm concerned with

165
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,460
it's important to

166
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,310
acknowledge that not every form of reasoning

167
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,410
the even precise model

168
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,160
for example human common sense

169
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,350
comes constant or maybe not but

170
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,480
it's difficult to

171
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,050
give precise model to common sense and actually to come up with a computer program

172
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,550
that can

173
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,500
like human even ten years old chart for example

174
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,440
we will be looking at very specific models reasoning

175
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,380
which has a precise mathematical

176
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:37,890
this is an overview of some users of logic in computer science

177
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,390
the very basic level you

178
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,670
logic gates

179
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,330
which are the fundamental ingredients

180
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,440
chips processors and everything

181
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,100
and also

182
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,950
now since computer

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,970
computer science is really an artifact of human mind

184
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,450
and you know to discover flaws in hardware and software you have to

185
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,780
we look into the underlying process of human thought this

186
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,380
right so

187
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,570
logic is unsurprisingly used in

188
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:14,100
it's hardware and software verification so the famous telebox

189
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,700
example that was discovered by

190
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,030
while doing so

191
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,950
floating point arithmetic was because there was some error in the lookup table in certain

192
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,890
and in tallinn and the for example has since put a huge amount

193
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,670
resources into

194
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,690
formerly very fine with cheap or process correct

195
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,230
software that makes it a bit difficult because unlike

196
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,690
hardware is it has

197
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,140
finite state

198
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,280
the logic is predictable

199
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,450
software you know the the complexity of stories so huge

200
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,360
it depends on the correctness of the compiler

201
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,190
correctness of

202
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,950
programming language semantics

203
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,510
more that the problem is

204
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,950
when he was using was trying

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,820
the program specifications depends on a lot of factors and

206
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,190
generally it is intractable

207
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,640
but still people can focus on a specific subset of

208
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,920
software like microkernel which has run rather a simple and predictive

209
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,920
for example one project and it is

210
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,670
this verification of

211
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,170
l four microkernel it's microkernel for real-time systems

212
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,370
another to topics is this

213
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,490
high high-level programming language

214
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,580
so there is this thing called logic programme which was very popular back in nineteen

215
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,020
the idea is that

216
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,500
just how computer what you want and computers was to figure out what you want

217
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,670
and of course

218
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,520
we were going very well

219
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,350
so but still it has a huge influence on

220
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,350
artificial intelligence

221
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:05,230
so the idea of many ideas from logic programming fine grained

222
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,840
artificial intelligence

223
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,910
and in a second we'll see more about aspects

224
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,900
OK i

225
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,960
use of logic in a such as planning

226
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,860
scheduling diagnosis

227
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:24,530
and also models of agents martin my multi

228
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,790
this is the overview of the three lectures

229
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,660
i'll start with what is usually called propositional logic

230
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:39,220
covering the syntax semantics and some basic notions such models

231
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:44,830
within models satisfiability binary decision diagrams

232
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,600
and then the second lecture on cover first order logic

233
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,850
this is the lighting which can

234
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,660
form statements about quantification over

235
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,420
so only

236
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,150
and the last well

237
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,340
the technology that this is logic the reason about

238
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,410
different modes of truth

239
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,940
and the thing

240
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,150
of all these three logics propositional logic is

241
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,400
probably the most natural in terms of its application in

242
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,210
large scale industrial verification

243
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,020
so probably got lengthy of propositional logic

244
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,330
now what's propositional logic

245
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,910
basically concerned with propositions

246
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,430
propositional statement can

247
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,140
it can either be true or false

248
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,120
well so interested in studying composition

249
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,770
the truth of this

250
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,210
memory whether RAM memory or disk memory

251
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,580
so there are other resources that we may care about

252
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,440
OK but predominantly we focus on performance

253
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,090
OK so

254
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,200
this is of a course about performance i like to put things in perspective a

255
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,140
little bit by starting out and asking

256
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,550
in programming what's more

257
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:21,530
and performance appearing in engineering situation and writing code

258
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,060
i writing software

259
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,210
what's more important than performance

260
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,320
correctness good

261
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,460
what else

262
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,540
simplicity can be

263
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,300
very good

264
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,270
OK often much more important than performance

265
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,470
cost OK we and what type cost thinking

266
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,390
no but i mean it will cost of one

267
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,220
we're talking software right

268
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,980
so whatever the cost you have in mind

269
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,710
OK so so then you're sort of

270
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,070
OK there are some costs are involved in programming like

271
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,830
programmer time

272
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,300
the programmer times noting also that might be

273
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,400
stability came robustness of the software

274
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,400
OK doesn't break all the time

275
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,330
what else

276
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:32,550
good engine engineers here

277
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,150
a lot of things

278
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,540
what features

279
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,410
features can be more important

280
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,470
having a wider collection of features in your competitors functionality

281
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,210
OK is designed in a way where you can make changes in local part of

282
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,130
the code and it doesn't have to make changes across the code in order to

283
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,330
effect a simple change in the functionality

284
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,240
OK there one big one which is definitely especially in the nineties was like the

285
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,250
big thing computers

286
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,770
the big thing

287
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,000
o security actually good cunningham that down securities x one OK

288
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,210
that's actually been more in the two thousand OK security has been in for more

289
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,570
important performance

290
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:29,400
scalability has been important although scalability in some senses is performance-related but yes scalability is

291
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,660
so what was the big breakthrough in the and why do people use mackintosh's rather

292
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,050
then windows those people who were of that religion

293
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,830
user friendliness

294
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,470
wow if you look at the number of cycles of computers that went into user

295
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,400
friendliness in the nineties it grew from almost nothing to where it is now

296
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:58,010
the vast part of the computation goes into user-friendly so all those things are more

297
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,080
important than performance

298
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,040
so this is a course on

299
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,290
OK so then you can say OK well so why do we bother

300
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,310
then why study

301
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,270
OK if it's at the bottom of the heap

302
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,850
almost always people would rather have these other things

303
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,490
then performance

304
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,990
you go up and you say it to rather performance more user friendly more user

305
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,590
friendliness is almost always

306
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,970
you know more important than performance why do we care

307
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:53,550
that wasn't user prices sometimes performance is correlated with user friendliness

308
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,890
OK you know nothing is more frustrating sitting there waiting right

309
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,330
OK so that's that's a good reason what some other reasons why we

310
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:10,730
sometimes a real time constraints so they don't actually work unless they performed

311
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,520
party x well i we don't measuring user we don't usually quantifies the friendliness from

312
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,690
not sure that's what i understand what you're saying so we don't get he says

313
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,650
get don't get exponential

314
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:37,030
performance improvements in user friendliness we often don't get better performance either by the way

315
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,800
sometimes we do but

316
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,260
that's good

317
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:52,560
so there are several reasons that i think are important one is that off and

318
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,980
measures the line between the feasible and the invisible

319
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,150
OK so we heard some of these things for example in real time

320
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:06,500
when the real time requirements if it's not fast enough is simply not function

321
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:12,140
or if it uses too much memory is simply not going to work for you

322
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,990
and as a consequence what you find is algorithms are on the cutting edge of

323
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,370
if you're talking about just three implementing stuff that people did

324
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,650
ten years ago

325
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,530
performance isn't that important at some level

326
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,560
but you're talking about doing stuff that nobody has done before

327
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,720
one of the reasons often that they haven't done it is because it's too time-consuming

328
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,690
it's too

329
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,750
know things don't scale and so forth

330
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,720
so that's one reason OK

331
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,120
is this feasible verses invisible

332
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:47,960
now the thing is that algorithms give you an eight language for talking about program

333
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,110
OK and that turns out to be is language that is

334
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:59,140
and pervasive through computer science is that the theoretical language is what gets adopted by

335
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,230
the practitioners

336
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,610
because it's clean way of thinking about things

337
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,890
i think it's a good way i think about performance and the reason it's on

338
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,590
the bottom of the heap

339
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,680
it's sort of like

340
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,290
performances like

341
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,280
y currency

342
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,550
OK so you say

343
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,250
what good is the stack of hundred dollar bills do for you OK when she

344
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,630
rather have

345
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:30,900
or water or shelter or whatever you're willing to pay those hundred dollar

346
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,110
bills for

347
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,830
the hundred dollar bills

348
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,970
four for that

349
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,540
OK even though water is far more important to you're living

350
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:49,260
well similarly performances what you use to pay for user friendliness

351
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,660
what you pay for security and you hear people say

352
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,830
for example

353
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,780
that you know i want greater functionality so people program in job

354
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,600
even though it's much slower than c

355
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,730
because it has

356
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,590
and they say it cost me maybe factor three or something in performance to program

357
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,370
in java but it's but job is worth it because it's got all these object

358
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,600
around the number of time steps

359
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,870
and then you get to the door

360
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,890
or you fail to you failed

361
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,640
and then you could make the decision

362
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,440
right so it's just it allows this flexibility

363
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,980
so so markov decision processes basically recover all you can do all the things that

364
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:34,080
you do for options with markov decision processes that the distinction between san markov decision

365
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,420
processes mdps options is that we have what we have

366
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,040
we have the ability to

367
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,680
be executing an option for all to be able to look inside the option and

368
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,440
no would be doing at lower level and that has certain advantages that the options

369
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,560
OK so only do

370
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,660
so i would took like to quick things in the album one mu one two

371
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,580
you can define you can define own actions which includes these behaviours

372
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,020
call that capital o and you can find the optimal value functions with respect to

373
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,940
the start of sub s and beast accused are several that's come out

374
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,890
by the way if you have a little a you can now little only for

375
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,600
these options and all the value function like things that we talked about before they

376
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,810
can be can be can be recovered but let me give you some more insight

377
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,500
about that how can they would go his recovery

378
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,350
the award and the transition probabilities the order of primitive action is the number you

379
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:40,290
get when you take an action and the transition probabilities of the transitions probabilities the

380
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,660
one time step the action takes of the distribution of next it's how do we

381
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,440
define these beasts these quantities for

382
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,390
an option to do that

383
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,810
everything else will be will work so here's the idea

384
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,620
the reward for adoption

385
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,330
it's just the expected reward expected sum of discounted what you get

386
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,310
when you

387
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,140
start adoption until termination

388
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,000
that's it

389
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,330
the reward for a certain number

390
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:10,330
in this state if you start option what's the expected reward expect again until

391
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,500
the behavior for that option terminates

392
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,580
the more tricky part is the transition probability that's actually not

393
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,640
all you do

394
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,870
it's simply asked

395
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,210
what is the expected

396
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:28,270
the probability of terminating impossible states

397
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,250
that's not

398
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:34,640
just as simple as that because you think discounting into account so is discounted

399
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,210
probably because you know if you if you don't stage five in two steps that

400
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,790
in different

401
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,180
that stage five in ten steps to building

402
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,730
discounted probability so the way these these transition probabilities that no longer sum to one

403
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,980
because the discount factor is taken into account but that's the just expected

404
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,020
discounted probabilities often terminating in different states

405
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:05,000
and with these definitions you can write down the bellman optimality equations you can move

406
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,390
it and you can do

407
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,850
the evaluation of two value iteration and q learning or whatever it is everything everything

408
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,020
just works

409
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,330
all the matches for the future

410
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,710
so the very simple idea

411
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,690
we were able to recover now

412
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,690
the flexibility we are planning

413
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,640
or think

414
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,600
different timescales because these options could be in many different timescales like some strict hierarchical

415
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,270
notion you have some options small in duration some of longer duration all that one

416
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,060
everything works

417
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,830
we have the representation

418
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,870
before being able to

419
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:46,750
capture the ability to plan learn with flexible timescale

420
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,390
because the hard part is

421
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,500
what should these options b

422
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,560
and there's a lot of work on trying to figure out

423
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,480
you know where the options come from

424
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,460
how do we use experience in the world to learn option not think of options

425
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,140
the skills

426
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,690
we go about the world these accumulate skills we don't open the door we now

427
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,910
to build some notable tables

428
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:16,980
so some of us have the skill of you know powerpoint come shame but so

429
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,580
we have the skills

430
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,440
we we can we can now

431
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,680
plan to learn in terms of these skills and and so it is obvious what

432
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,440
talked about how often might come from

433
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,980
doors of bottlenecks you can think of bottlenecks more generally seem may have

434
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,690
you may build options to its bottlenecks

435
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,980
reuse skills that

436
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,210
possible policies that we used over and over again might be useful to encapsulate form

437
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:46,960
of scale are often people played with these sort of ideas

438
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,180
is that there is enough to show that learning options but there are

439
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,060
simple things that have been explored in terms of learning in terms of learning options

440
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,410
was going to try to give you a sense if we are able to

441
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,940
ways of behaving at

442
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,270
flexible levels of

443
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,160
abstract temporal abstraction

444
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:19,480
and and planning and learning which is to say now everything things works beautifully

445
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,040
questions about that

446
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,000
i'm going to skip all this in the

447
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:30,750
then you have many many results become available so

448
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,350
here is a i give you one flavor of results

449
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,810
so here is you know continuous two-dimensional domain

450
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,000
is it possible landmarks

451
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,640
you might have options that take us to landmarks in some local neighbourhood that landmarks

452
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,160
so each so the local neighbourhood centre landmark and you might know

453
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,870
how to get to the landmarks in the neighborhood and then you can begin planning

454
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,770
with these you plan to go from

455
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,440
maybe from landmark to landmark

456
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,190
as a way of navigating

457
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:05,730
and can do much more faster planning this way that if you are planned

458
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,270
low-level continues

459
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,940
continues behaviours of course

460
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,210
you could do something smart and that you could realise

461
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,390
this is called this is sort of simple result we have that says basically you

462
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,960
could show one landmark

463
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,640
head to head towards the other land which is the red line

464
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,410
but as soon as you reach

465
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,640
a location in which you if you start again you will switch to a different

466
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,250
landmarks you can switch

467
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:35,020
it turns out so you can terminate options early

468
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,390
and we obtain

469
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,710
benefits of planning so early termination of options is an easy

470
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,640
very easy

471
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:48,230
i think it falls out of planning that can obtain a grade

472
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:52,520
OK i'm going to start with this you can buy the learning options

473
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,270
here's a little thing else

474
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,540
again just don't you find interesting you find all kinds of literature on this so

475
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,160
how do we learn models of options the reward and transition probabilities

476
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:08,040
if we could only learn about options to actually executed would be dead

477
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,250
right because you can only behave

478
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,510
what's what's that

479
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,620
ten rules OK so it's

480
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,200
the animals

481
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,080
peter pick there

482
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,370
and i noticed that let's say that before the reform arises on the left-hand side

483
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,950
it's all sorts

484
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,490
all the ten levels

485
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,960
and another

486
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,010
positive than the also that's minimum levels

487
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,720
and this time it's a negative

488
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,340
roughly twenty eight years

489
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,930
negative twenty

490
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,300
so what i'm getting into the occurrence

491
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:53,370
i have a negative and negative and for part of the positive and negative twenty

492
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,150
that adds up to to zero but more interestingly i can show the same thing

493
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,000
calling this current measuring probe

494
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,920
directly across that node

495
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,490
and notice that

496
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,900
the net current

497
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:09,230
that is entering into this note here is zero

498
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,630
OK so that's just show you that KCL does indeed hold in practice and it

499
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,780
is not just a figment of our imagination

500
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,660
so long

501
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,970
before i go on

502
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,250
i wanted to

503
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,590
o point one other thing out

504
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,770
notice that i've written down to assumptions of the lumped matter discipline

505
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,860
there is no assumption of the lumped matter discipline

506
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,150
and that assumption

507
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,630
in spirit at least shared by

508
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,370
the point must simplification in physics as well

509
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,120
and someone to function as

510
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,010
something which i did not mention

511
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,220
but you can

512
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,910
reading your notes in section in

513
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,740
section eight point two

514
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,680
in the appendix

515
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:07,460
what is the assumption that is shared in spirit

516
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,840
with the point mass simplification

517
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,730
the assumption we made here

518
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:20,280
is that in almost all the signals that we can study in this course

519
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,400
he made this assumption that

520
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:27,430
the signal speeds of interest transition speeds and so on are much slower than the

521
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,230
speed of light

522
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:35,370
OK that's my signal transitions speeds of interest are much slower than the speed of

523
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:42,160
remember the laws of motion the discrete laws of motion breakdown if you begin approach

524
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,710
if you objects begin moving at the speed of light

525
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:50,280
again the same token here are lumped circuit abstraction breaks down if we approach the

526
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,300
speed of light

527
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:58,130
and the following courses that talk about waveguides another distributed analysis techniques that deal with

528
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,750
our signals that travel at speed close to be like

529
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,270
so i think that that we go on to

530
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:15,100
talking about method one of circuit analysis this is called the basic

531
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,130
kvl KCL method

532
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:26,790
so just based on those to some simple algebraic relations i can analyse very interesting

533
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,120
and complicated circuits

534
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,870
the method goals as

535
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,550
so that's our goal

536
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,250
is given a circuit like this

537
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,330
our goal is to solve it

538
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,660
in this course we will be doing all kinds of things analysis and and synthesis

539
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,670
analysis says given a circuit

540
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,010
OK what can you tell me about this

541
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:53,600
OK so this sort of existing circuits for all the voltages and currents voltages across

542
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,130
elements and current through those elements

543
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,760
since says given a function

544
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:04,480
i mean i ask you to go and look OK so for analysis here

545
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,840
we can apply this method that i want to show you

546
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,860
and the idea here is that

547
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:13,770
given a circuit like this that has figured out all the voltages and currents that

548
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:19,300
are that a function of the way these elements are connected

549
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,510
the basic KVL and KCL method has the following steps

550
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,150
the first step is to write down

551
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:32,130
the element v i relationships

552
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:35,520
right down the element v i relationships all the elements

553
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,610
the second step is to write KCL

554
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,380
for all the nodes

555
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,370
and the third step is to write KVL for

556
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:48,650
all the nodes in the circuit that's it

557
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:54,090
go ahead and i don't mind rules KVL and KCL and then go ahead and

558
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,550
OK so what do we do an example of course

559
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,900
but just to just around as a refresher

560
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,740
we've looked at a bunch of elements so far

561
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,840
and for phototransistor

562
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,700
the element relation says that is

563
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,320
i are

564
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,770
there are the resistance of the

565
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,200
element here

566
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,070
four able to source

567
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,640
the is equal to

568
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:31,890
not that's the element relationships and for current source

569
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:38,580
the element is the solution is i is simply the current flowing through the element

570
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:48,050
OK so

571
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,630
these are some of the simple element rules for

572
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:55,880
the device is that the current source with the source and the resistance

573
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,010
let's go ahead and solve

574
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,690
so the simple circuit

575
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:04,340
and what do is go ahead and solve the circuit for OK for talk page

576
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,760
five of your notes

577
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,630
i'm going to go ahead and

578
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,780
edit this circuit here

579
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,130
you can scribble the values on

580
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,820
on the notes on page five

581
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,440
so the first

582
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:34,060
so yesterday i show i presented you that the directed graphical models

583
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:42,120
which are diagrams representing probability distribution over a set of random variables

584
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,170
graphical models provide

585
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
the u

586
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,990
on how to decompose the joint probability

587
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,940
the product of factors

588
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:59,390
each depending on your on a subset of variables say remember

589
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,780
this equation was where

590
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,910
we have to pretty as

591
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:10,390
over the conditional probability of the nodes even their parents

592
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:17,360
and i show also yesterday talk about how graphical mothers display

593
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,350
the conditional independence of nodes

594
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,810
i will try to

595
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,970
given the intuition of why this decomposition can be

596
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,720
can be interested

597
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,780
four four questions of inference and learning

598
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,780
is that

599
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,160
OK for let's go into inference

600
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:53,600
let's begin with this example that you know hate missing

601
00:36:53,710 --> 00:37:00,110
when i was looking for critics that's why i

602
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,970
it's the realise that there was a very obvious

603
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,030
solution really easy

604
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,380
so you're going to hate it and

605
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,970
even more

606
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,410
so as you remember

607
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:14,140
we have over four random variables

608
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,610
is it love you're not has training not

609
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:22,630
this has been going on or not graphs what

610
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,330
we can decompose the joint probability

611
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,860
going from the top

612
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,470
the but

613
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,520
so what

614
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:38,620
the for those who here the question was given this graphical model

615
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,130
and that i give you some of the

616
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,570
some probability is related to the

617
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,690
the things

618
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,790
what called compute the conditional probability

619
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,280
the of

620
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:00,600
i mean of this was but the more not interesting to do is so base

621
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,820
and then taking

622
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,560
at the time probability of

623
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,030
wet grass and the spring on

624
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,250
and marginalizing it over the two of those variables

625
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,440
then you obtain the joint

626
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,220
you have a decomposition of the joint distribution

627
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,850
which is this one

628
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:22,570
which is which gives us exactly what we know

629
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,650
it's not it's not something strange because

630
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:33,320
the probabilities i have access to the shape of the graph

631
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,100
are are related

632
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,930
because this is the causality graph and what they measure usually comes from causes

633
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:53,320
so let's think about this so you you saw yesterday playing with these properties that

634
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,880
it was difficult to infer

635
00:38:54,910 --> 00:39:00,870
it was messy you don't know from which place you have to begin you're you're

636
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:08,160
taking this principle way of saying OK i have my graph i try to find

637
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,560
again the joint because the know how to decompose it

638
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:18,060
plus if you see here when i'm doing this summation in fact

639
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,880
for example in here

640
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:26,190
i have two sons one over here and one overseas and in fact p of

641
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,820
these two first there

642
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,220
p of c and p of

643
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,440
s one s because when given c don't depend on are so in fact that

644
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,720
will be able to

645
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,820
to factorize them from there

646
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,010
the sum

647
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:45,300
of our making them so i will not have to sum over all the terms

648
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,710
over are entirely

649
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,270
two last terms that are going to be some

650
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,730
these are again

651
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,630
that that's that's too

652
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,800
i'm going to talk more about that but that's how

653
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:08,920
most algorithms we we're going to work on to some simplified inference

654
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,900
it's going to be true to intervene into these programs

655
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,760
we have seen with a simple model which is the

656
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,870
make a first order markov model

657
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,700
which looks like this

658
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,640
we denote english in the chain

659
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,980
and the errors of the same

660
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,200
the direction

661
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,710
so let's let q

662
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,520
from one to n these sequence

663
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,820
so be random vector representing representing a sequence of states

664
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,890
in the first order markov model

665
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,200
and each of my

666
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,610
of my

667
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:53,190
each of my vote variables can take

668
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,370
OK very useful almost i have case

669
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,940
the first order markov assumption which is the same what

670
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:10,070
what i see here in the graph is that the probability of one moment in

671
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:13,500
the sequence given

672
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,130
what was the previous all the previous

673
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,360
element in the sequence it's only

674
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,400
can be can be simplified to the

675
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:29,710
the probability of this element in the sequence and the just the previous one

676
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,390
so using that or using the

677
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,980
the graphical model

678
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:39,120
we know that the joint likelihood of the sequence

679
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,060
it can be the right in the past as in

680
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,430
in the cell

681
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,840
in mean because i have to have the probability of prior probability on the states

682
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,990
for the first element in the sequence

683
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,580
and then the product of these probabilities

684
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:05,320
six people

685
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,070
no because

686
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,260
you're right

687
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,000
should go from

688
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:22,500
because here it would be

689
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,560
and here to get right

690
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:33,550
let's not so we have this model and and now let's assume that we are

691
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,580
interested in the marginal probability

692
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:43,210
of one element from MSP nice sequence so what's the probability that of being in

693
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:48,250
one particular state at the given point in a sequence

694
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,790
taking the joint distribution we have two

695
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,440
to marginalize over

696
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,570
all the elements of my sequence

697
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:03,250
to know what's what's the probability of

698
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,330
of this particular element so

699
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,680
you seem to some that goes

700
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,360
i have

701
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:12,210
two minus one some then

702
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,520
n minus the

703
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,520
his other sons so that i have done some over over two but a sum

704
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,250
over all the others element in the sequence

705
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:26,310
bill and zoubin and carl what about a infinite hidden markov model where the number

706
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,190
of states

707
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,610
is infinite

708
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:35,840
and that and it turned out that a problem that is that

709
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:40,510
we have the transition probability coming out from each state is going to be a

710
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:43,150
distribution over infinite number of states

711
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,750
so this is the transition probability from this states two

712
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,470
each of the possible states is infinite

713
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:53,930
if you if we simply try to

714
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:59,720
do a it's if we simply start off with the bayesian by the hidden markov

715
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,640
model and place the dirichlet prior on the transition probabilities and try to take that

716
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,930
infinity we get exactly the same problems as we have in the topic modeling case

717
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:12,800
where the probably the set of states

718
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,860
for which

719
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,140
out of

720
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,040
out of each state

721
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:22,640
we have a set of states that have high probability of transitioning into

722
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,590
right and four different states

723
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,600
four different previous states we have a different set of probabilities and this probably a

724
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:37,860
different set of next possible next states and this sets don't overlap at all

725
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,090
if you just take the infinite limit and so again we have to place a

726
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:48,400
use the hierarchical dirichlet process to solve the problem basically that forces sharing of next

727
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,180
across the different states

728
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,730
and the models come given by this

729
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,270
i want to go into detail actually

730
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,720
in the last five minutes i'll tell you about the last

731
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,110
pittman yor processes

732
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,540
right so

733
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,230
it's basically a

734
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,040
somebody is asking about how

735
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,050
we can

736
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,670
the chinese restaurant process two

737
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:25,890
so in the chinese restaurant process that i just described the number of clusters grows

738
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,050
as long of and

739
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:33,630
the number of tables causes long the number of customers and somebody is asking whether

740
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,050
we can generalize this to a different functional dependence between the number of tables and

741
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,380
the number of customers

742
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,070
and this is a particular generalisation of the chinese restaurant process

743
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,040
so the first customer comes in will against it at the first table

744
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,290
subsequent customer so customer and

745
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,590
will sit at table k

746
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:58,260
with the following probability so

747
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,800
it was the custom and was set to book a with probability and k minus

748
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,380
over n minus one plus alpha

749
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,680
OK where nk is is going to be

750
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:13,330
it is the number of customers there is currently sitting at table k

751
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:17,220
but is another parameter which is between zero and one

752
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:20,830
and l fives are usual concentration parameter

753
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:23,510
and the

754
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:29,930
customer will sit at a new table with probability alpha plus b that big k

755
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,720
over and one class of

756
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,760
so there

757
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,710
became number of tables right so

758
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:45,390
if at some point in a chinese restaurant process we have something

759
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,710
like this one

760
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,180
and customer for comes in and decides to

761
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,960
and this has to decide whether to sit here and see here on the table

762
00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:00,400
so the probability that customers for is going to stay here is going to be

763
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,960
the number of

764
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,210
customers are really sitting there has two

765
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:07,100
minus beta

766
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:11,900
divided by something probability that customer forwards it here

767
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,610
is one minus the data divided something

768
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,790
and the probability that customer force consider new table is going to be

769
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:27,020
how far past to be so this who here so we subtract bit here is

770
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,710
supposed to be here and working at the mass into here

771
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:42,550
so that's the two parameter generalisation of the chinese restaurant process and it also has

772
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:46,930
a rich gets richer property rights so if this table really has lots of customers

773
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:51,040
then there will be a chance that new customers coming in will sit at that

774
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,470
table is also going to be much

775
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,480
but it also has a different property which is that

776
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:01,300
if we see lots of tables already in if

777
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,220
if there have been lots of tables

778
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:05,630
that's used in the restaurant

779
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,300
there were in each table working sub a bit beta and we're going to the

780
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,470
probability that the new customer was it yet another new table is going to be

781
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:15,430
large two

782
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,250
because this kid has been ten will be quite large

783
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:25,430
he cannot produce this is interesting

784
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,340
the poll also behavior

785
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,810
so we can show that this thing is also if an infinitely exchangeable

786
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:40,550
and so we can apply different there again and say that OK there is a

787
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,970
random probability measure

788
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,640
there is a random probability measure that underlies this generalization and this is what's called

789
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,130
pitman yor processes

790
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:56,770
it also a stick breaking construction we show one more about

791
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:00,830
is given here if you're interested

792
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:02,850
can i want to see show you

793
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,330
this type here

794
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:11,060
this is the diagram for the dirichlet process and chinese social process

795
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:18,190
over here we have customers on the x axis and tables on the y axis

796
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:20,720
the point here

797
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:21,970
it is simply

798
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:23,710
the customers sitting at that

799
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,480
a particular table

800
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:31,590
and as the number of customers grows the number of tables also growth

801
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,800
get it grows pretty slowly is a lot of and

802
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,430
so this thing is logarithmic

803
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:40,070
in the case of the pitman yor process

804
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:43,830
the number of tables grows but at a much faster rate

805
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:47,090
so we can show that the number of tables grows and

806
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:51,920
on the order of alpha times and to the better

807
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:55,380
but that's all parameter between zero and one

808
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:59,100
and if you look at the

809
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:04,300
the distribution over the sizes of tables it looks like a power law so if

810
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,800
this is on a log log plot and it looks like basically a straight line

811
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:13,670
well in the case of the dirichlet process it doesn't illustrate the

812
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:18,800
o and with kind

813
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:24,300
and application of the pitman yor processes to language modeling so

814
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:28,730
the nice thing with pitman yor processes that it produces this

815
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:31,440
distributions with power laws of statistics

816
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,360
and one of the key

817
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,980
one of the domains for which we see lots of power law behavior is is

818
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,100
in languages in languages we have a few

819
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,930
words that we see all the time

820
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,350
what's like the and and i n you and so on

821
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:54,250
and we see we'll but also we have lots of words which we see that

822
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,600
really rally

823
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,990
i draw your attention

824
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,250
on these kind of

825
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:04,430
of approach for solving multiclass SVM

826
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:10,190
you want to find an and if you if you have classes you want to

827
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:14,160
find m w one

828
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:18,590
and you want to solve these communication problem

829
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:22,840
when you have a slack variable for each training point

830
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:29,630
and again the full you get in there is something you get the k k

831
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:32,910
you get

832
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:37,850
and you can get for the one that is so

833
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:45,300
all in this way computing there are lots of other issues and function

834
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,370
go back

835
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:51,310
binary SVM for

836
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:54,530
with the soft margin

837
00:51:54,580 --> 00:52:02,870
i think is shown OK

838
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,010
i want to

839
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,030
you mention on the on another thing

840
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,070
before going OK so this is a

841
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:14,410
our optimisation problem

842
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,110
and another thing

843
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:22,600
that also nello briefly said this morning is that when you have an optimisation problem

844
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:23,840
you can

845
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,260
the on the

846
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:31,610
on the objective function and on the constraint

847
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,450
you know oporto in mind

848
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,340
for example we had the right

849
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,030
optimisation problem

850
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,700
you know and i will be

851
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:44,620
and the like

852
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,130
a general rule from

853
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:54,270
for the signing classifier you try to be a bit more clear

854
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:59,280
you can decide any and we try to classify by simply choosing a loss function

855
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,620
so that measures the head on the training data and the regularisation them

856
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:09,850
for example the four d so for the soft margin SVM

857
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,430
the loss function is the loss

858
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,730
losses these inspiration

859
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:20,990
imagine that you like in the expression on the hinge loss on the formula of

860
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:25,200
and the regularisation term the

861
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,320
no this i

862
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:29,690
of the of w

863
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:33,710
you you go back into our optimisation problems

864
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:38,540
but it can also the same is true if we put the square loss

865
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,380
and will

866
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:47,250
we get without having the division among us and this question norm i

867
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,200
of the

868
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:54,580
problem that i show this morning for fisher discriminant analysis

869
00:53:54,620 --> 00:54:00,370
in general you can have a bunch of loss functions that are all operated bound

870
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:04,930
on the true loss that is zero if you have no error on the training

871
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:08,180
data one if you have one

872
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,860
and so the into losses the

873
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,650
los used by SVM

874
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:18,550
the square loss is the loss by fisher discriminant analysis but the men like columns

875
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:23,630
and depending on the loss you can sign your classifier

876
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,870
what sort

877
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,810
choosing a loss and changing the regularisation

878
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,990
you can do this and also

879
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:35,790
interesting article

880
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:39,600
i'll introduce

881
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,040
the cannot

882
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:43,610
maybe you

883
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:46,530
i got because we can

884
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:52,120
we we talk about model so when the w is apparent when is some nice

885
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,700
so when we

886
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:56,870
can use of margin SVM

887
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,180
but what about if we have

888
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,840
really nice there what about very problem

889
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:10,120
the major breakthrough will support vector machine which that

890
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:15,370
they have been proposed the simple algorithm that is able to deal with you in

891
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:20,340
a very easy manner with with the nonseparable

892
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:25,270
we do not so the idea of support vector machines to map the data into

893
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:27,590
another dimension of the feature space

894
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:30,400
when the training set is separable

895
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:32,620
you can see from the beach

896
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,770
what do i need

897
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:40,460
our marketing function phi

898
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:44,540
and we everything going to fight

899
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:53,900
i think having fishing mapping yourself expensive since five is usually very high dimensional we

900
00:55:53,900 --> 00:56:02,160
want to solve the optimisation problem without explicitly mapping the that year to phi other

901
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:08,700
we do that we split problem and we compute the function that is the dog

902
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:15,660
the product of the five and it is called the

903
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:19,580
i want to say before going

904
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:25,940
for a specific into the topic of the can that can only possible way

905
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:27,920
to deal with nonlinearities

906
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:36,170
a bunch of algorithms from much learning to deal with nonlinearity with stockings so using

907
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,110
cascade of classifiers

908
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:44,320
i would say it was the match these but perhaps a multilayer perceptron the first

909
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:50,640
of backing but also very problematic is boosting when you combine

910
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:55,980
a lot of weak learners so a lot of very simple classifier

911
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:58,860
to get a complex issues and function

912
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:03,650
it features some of the state what i mean you go you combine a lot

913
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,240
a simple linear classifier to get to

914
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,370
separation of

915
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,530
so let's and that any more

916
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:19,840
kernel method

917
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:23,620
so they do have a problem of support vector machine when we have introduced the

918
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,350
he is this one

919
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:28,630
you know microsoft and and and amazon google

920
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:33,240
i've done that yahoo and we had to build the data group

921
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:37,610
i've got a bigger scale on how to do build yeah research

922
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:41,930
where we actually convinced a whole bunch of people to leave university careers

923
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,700
join a newly-formed lab

924
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:48,700
and it was really based on the scope of the vision

925
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:52,130
the ability to do stuff that you couldn't do anywhere else

926
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:56,760
and you know every start-up will have a unique

927
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:02,370
you know nish something that focused on where you know you can do that the company

928
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,890
and what you want do is really attract people who resonate with that so

929
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:11,890
i think passion and excitement or and the big vision or are very very big in attracting people

930
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:18,070
ok so let's move on we've got another audience question and can directs fun

931
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:23,560
to sama equals or you are involved in start-ups on opposite sides of the world's

932
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,280
and in both west middle-east

933
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,660
so the question is

934
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:31,240
how much does the location of the on stop mass

935
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,300
excellent question

936
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,420
so i would argue

937
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,690
for data mining or

938
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,140
or even big data company

939
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:44,840
doesn't matter

940
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:47,190
and here's what

941
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,030
it's the

942
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:57,920
maybe the norm is that your you want to be aware that talent is and all that kind of stuff

943
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:01,910
i'm i'm going to share something with you i mean i've been out of young now long

944
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:03,890
enough that i can share something internal with you

945
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,620
my in my last yeah

946
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,930
i think i made a lot of enemies

947
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,930
as as an chief officer

948
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,290
i came up with a with a rule

949
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:18,870
i had

950
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,810
a pretty large you know to pre big groups

951
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:23,390
reporting to me

952
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,610
he said actually

953
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,340
no one could higher

954
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:27,910
any engineer

955
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,480
in the bay area

956
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:34,350
without my approval as as vp an officer of the company

957
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:36,520
and people complain

958
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:41,090
and people made noises and all of that and the reason for that is just silicon

959
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:46,620
is a hotbed silicon valley is all the talent is whether all excitement is

960
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,090
but my my ultimate judgment was

961
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,420
you know overinflated titles

962
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:53,330
overinflated salaries

963
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,260
talent claims

964
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,410
no ability to retain whatsoever

965
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,840
so you know we went to a very strange places

966
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,630
and rightly went to acquire the whole company

967
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,880
urbana-champaign illinois to get talent

968
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:13,920
when i did my own startups

969
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,230
i had teams in places like chile

970
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:20,970
syria when it was ok to do that

971
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,910
you know you can find talent

972
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:26,740
if you train them you can retain

973
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:32,820
retention has a lot of value and and deep training you know at some point

974
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,600
in the was this place to do it you know now india's almost like silicon valley

975
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,080
or at least bangalore is

976
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,270
so so locations

977
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:45,920
you know matters from the sense so you know watching your costs and and and being able to

978
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:46,810
retain people

979
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,520
as opposed to going to the hot spots

980
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:51,110
that's data mining right

981
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:57,680
it's a completely different discussion it comes to marketing where you have to have your sales people

982
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:02,100
and all of that that's that's different you know design sales marketing is a different ballgame

983
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:03,910
but he was talking about the money

984
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:09,130
so that's i like to move on because i really like the question that just bubble up

985
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:10,070
to the top here

986
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:11,970
is it

987
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:15,000
still worth pursuing a phd as a

988
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:24,220
as as data scientists yeah or yeah yeah so one of the things that are to have

989
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,190
been advising these are for more than twenty years

990
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:30,940
at a certain point to everyone my students can take them aside

991
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,260
and try to persuade them that they should not get a phd

992
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:38,010
it's it's a major investment of time

993
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,870
as you very narrowly focused

994
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,980
what's the point you could be out there

995
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:49,690
having these ventures making a lot of money and it's only solve students who have graduated have kind

996
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,920
of past like blood and

997
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:56,830
decided to stay so why one reason is if you want to be professor

998
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:02,510
that's one of the things you still the phd uncertain companies it gives you access

999
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:04,770
certain kinds of problems

1000
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:08,800
but often it does not make sense to get a pc i'll just give you one quick example

1001
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:10,440
i had a student they work with

1002
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,000
incredibly incredibly talented hacker

1003
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:18,060
deep understanding of the data science the the math statistics

1004
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,690
just not a great researcher

1005
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:20,720
and i said to

1006
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,220
go so you do what you're good at

1007
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:27,080
and he for his own personal reasons insisted on getting a phd

1008
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:30,880
we decided to work together he went actually a phd robotics

1009
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:33,300
got his phd and anyone to google

1010
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,260
anyone to google about three or four years later that would otherwise

1011
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:39,420
and that was several million dollars

1012
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:45,260
so basically if the burden of proof i guess that's that's where put concisely

1013
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,040
if you want to get a phd

1014
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,580
the burden of proof is on year

1015
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,760
it's not like you know

1016
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:53,970
god decreed you should have a phd if you're smart

1017
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,480
why should you get a phd

1018
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:03,990
and i know foster you probably shouldn't as professor but ok

1019
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:06,310
yeah so i'm not professor

1020
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,940
i play one on tv

1021
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:15,020
what i would say my advice i think is not going to be very popular with with

1022
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:18,370
academia but i think in the long term it's in the benefit of academia

1023
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:20,910
i think if you just finished

1024
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,060
your masters

1025
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:26,240
and you're thinking of doing a phd especially in the field then

1026
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,140
my strong advice is

1027
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:29,010
don't do it

1028
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:32,990
go get a job go get a job for five years

1029
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:35,320
and then come back

1030
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:38,530
if you really want to do a phd because here's what happens

1031
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:40,730
you have no idea

1032
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,980
you have no idea

1033
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:45,220
of what the real problems are about

1034
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,510
right to me you know

1035
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:50,550
it you said that have ideas are below average

1036
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:51,930
i think

1037
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:54,040
eighty to ninety percent

1038
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:55,780
of thesis topics

1039
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,240
are totally useless

1040
01:03:57,430 --> 01:04:01,140
right ok this is not because the people some because the people are bad

1041
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,940
because they don't know better right

1042
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:08,430
they they just didn't see what's happening to understand what the problems are i actually think

1043
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:11,910
if people work for five to ten years and then have it in them

1044
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:15,900
passion wise to go to a phd they would do better research

1045
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,030
professors will get better papers

1046
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:21,360
and the weights selection basically measures how close

1047
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:25,720
the different pieces of the different images are in terms of how sharper blurry

1048
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,000
so what it does it ends of submit managing to combine the sharpest parts of

1049
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,540
all these images together to give you this result

1050
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:36,760
it seems the research from that's right

1051
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:38,480
OK so here

1052
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:42,490
let me go back now to the matrix formulation and talk about the mathematics a

1053
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,760
little bit more

1054
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:49,610
so now let's take this formulation that we had which was this linear combination of

1055
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:52,550
of all the pixels and also let me remind you even though this is a

1056
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:56,780
linear combination these weights w are actually a function of the data

1057
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:00,630
so this is not really a linear filter but it just sort of looks that

1058
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:05,590
OK so now if i take all of these weight functions and i stack them

1059
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:07,040
into a matrix

1060
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:11,760
i can write the whole image he had the whole reconstructed image he had

1061
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:15,740
as a function of the input noisy image y

1062
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:20,440
with a matrix w and this matrix w is going to be generally

1063
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:21,750
data dependent

1064
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,590
OK so from this point on i'm going to be working with this equations he

1065
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,920
had equals w times y and what i want to do is talk about the

1066
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,030
properties of this matrix w

1067
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:33,000
so let's

1068
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,080
discussed this w is very special matrix this is just a reminder of what each

1069
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,250
of this

1070
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,810
matrix w does

1071
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:47,820
one way we can rewrite this in matrix form with to write WSD inverse k

1072
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:48,720
where k

1073
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,560
is the matrix k i j

1074
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:55,910
and the inverse is the diagonal matrix which has the normalization factors

1075
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:58,940
simply along its tag

1076
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,290
so this is just a shorthand way of writing the whole thing all at once

1077
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:07,740
now i can factor this the inverse k

1078
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:11,350
by breaking up the inverse in two d the minus one half the is minus

1079
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:16,220
one half and then putting an idea factory the identity into the the myself to

1080
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,440
the one half

1081
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:19,780
and writing this w in this fashion

1082
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:23,260
now it turns out that the state of one minus one side one have is

1083
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:29,130
positive definite and because k is positive definite and this is just the product of

1084
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:30,820
that on the left and right with

1085
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:34,550
positive definite diagonal matrices then both l

1086
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:37,830
and in the one minus one has to do the one half of positive definite

1087
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:42,470
so it turns out w is in fact a positive definite matrix as well

1088
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:46,850
but w is positive definite but it is not symmetric

1089
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,290
OK this is a little bit

1090
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:49,440
sort of

1091
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:54,340
unexpected in the sense so is positive definite because it inherits the property from k

1092
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,800
but if you simply look at this equation here

1093
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:59,940
you can see that k is symmetric positive definite

1094
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,940
but because it gets multiplied on the left by the inverse w can be symmetric

1095
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,550
but it still is positive definite because of the second position so that's kind of

1096
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:14,270
interesting it turns out that even though w is not symmetric it is very close

1097
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:17,820
to being symmetric and i'll make the precise very shortly

1098
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:22,390
it turns out approximating it with the symmetric matrix has a lot of benefits as

1099
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:23,740
we will see

1100
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:27,770
OK so let me discuss the future of the other properties of the matrix w

1101
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,870
we said is positive definite it it's also row stochastic which means that the sum

1102
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:33,930
of each of its rows equals one

1103
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:40,670
so for matrices like this is a whole theory the current frobenius theory for positive

1104
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:45,940
stochastic matrices is one of the properties that its spectral radius is one so the

1105
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:49,770
top igon value is one and it also turns out to be an on repeated

1106
01:07:49,770 --> 01:07:51,550
i can use is unique

1107
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,910
and the dominant i can the corresponding to this i can tell you is

1108
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,060
o ones

1109
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:01,520
OK with the normalisation factor one over and whatever square would n

1110
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:07,260
there's also a these measures also have an ergodic properties so if you take w

1111
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:10,400
to the k th powers if you apply this filter many many times

1112
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,820
you don't get zero

1113
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:15,250
you get a matrix of rank one

1114
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:18,000
where this you one is the

1115
01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:21,340
i left

1116
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,140
singular left igon value corresponding to the one

1117
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:28,910
OK now if i go back to this for a second there's an in in

1118
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,920
interesting intuition behind this what this tells you is that because the dominant i can

1119
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:39,170
vector is is just constant what it means is that this filter w is invariant

1120
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:41,020
to constant images

1121
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,540
so if you give it an image

1122
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:44,580
doesn't vary

1123
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:46,130
and it just gives it back to

1124
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:50,350
which is what you would want for denoising filter so that's nice the math and

1125
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:52,120
the intuition kind of right

1126
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:57,800
OK so let's go on and talk about other interpretations of w are obviously

1127
01:08:57,910 --> 01:09:02,890
the you can think of w is the probability transition matrix for markov chains sort

1128
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:08,750
of the standard interpretation for row stochastic matrices but also in terms of graphical models

1129
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:12,670
of data and spectral methods there's interesting interpretation so let's say

1130
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,680
you take a pixel at position j and then think about pixels around it or

1131
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,910
anywhere in the image

1132
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:22,560
indexed by ISI and i think this is a node in the tree and these

1133
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,580
are the branches of the tree and so this is basically a weighted graph

1134
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,930
with the weights

1135
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:31,970
on each of the branches between i and j being k i j

1136
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:35,030
so if you take these weights k

1137
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:36,560
and construct

1138
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,160
the matrix k from them

1139
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:43,130
if you don't normalise it the way i just described in the previous slide

1140
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,350
and then if you take this

1141
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:47,490
w and normalized further using this

1142
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:52,360
minus i what you get is precisely what's called the graph laplacian

1143
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:56,640
in these other applications and of course the graph has been used in

1144
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:59,820
so many different applications all around

1145
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,790
so the point of this is that what i'm going to do is i'm going

1146
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:05,810
to be studying the spectrum of this matrix w

1147
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:08,360
to again a lot of insight about processing

1148
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:12,320
and people have been studying the spectrum of the graph laplacian for all kinds of

1149
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,110
other applications really equivalent

1150
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:17,820
so the study that i'm going to show you know about the spectrum of the

1151
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:19,070
graph laplacian

1152
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:21,840
the stuff ought to make a lot of sense

1153
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:22,960
OK so

1154
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:24,780
let's take a look at

1155
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:30,500
so it is the seat or house or the the underlying mechanical structure that gives

1156
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,230
us these various abilities

1157
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:37,940
these p functions are functions that we have by virtue of our brain so that

1158
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:45,810
ten you into saying that our mind and the physical view is just the brain

1159
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:51,120
but we probably shouldn't say that because after all shoot me there's my corpse lying

1160
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,610
on the stage well there's my brain

1161
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:56,770
you know my brain is still there in my head

1162
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:59,380
but we no longer have a person

1163
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:05,130
the person has died the person seems you know no longer exists whether strictly that's

1164
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:07,860
the best thing to say another question will have to come to a couple of

1165
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:13,660
but it seems pretty clear that the mind is being destroyed even though the brain

1166
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:17,510
is still there so i think i was wondering when there is the need to

1167
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:21,060
be careful maybe we don't normally have the need to be careful but when there

1168
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:22,970
is the need to be careful we should say

1169
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:27,410
talk of the mind is the way it is the way of talking about that

1170
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,290
function name

1171
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,660
of the body

1172
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:35,710
and and our best science suggests that a well-functioning body can

1173
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,080
perform these things can think and plan fall in love by virtue of the fact

1174
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,250
that the brain is functioning properly

1175
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:45,570
that's the visibles

1176
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:49,580
if we take this we know that the other other jewelers do

1177
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:54,100
what was death that is presumably the separation of the mind and the body with

1178
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:58,860
the destruction the perhaps the permanent separation with the destruction of the body

1179
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:03,850
what's death on the physical is to there's no extra entity

1180
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,430
the soul

1181
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,480
the mind is just the proper p functioning of the body

1182
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:17,170
the mind gets destroyed when the ability of the body to function in that way

1183
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:26,830
has been destroyed death is roughly the end of this set of functioning

1184
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:31,080
again this probably should be cleaned up and in a couple of weeks will spend

1185
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:35,530
a day or half period trying to clean up and make it somewhat more precise

1186
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:40,720
but there's nothing mysterious about death from the physical point of view released about the

1187
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:45,490
basic idea of what's going on and i got on a stereo

1188
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:50,070
i suppose i hold my boombox for you and it's playing music it's one of

1189
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:51,260
the things you can do

1190
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:55,150
and i drop it on the ground smashing

1191
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,500
no longer can function properly

1192
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:00,500
it's broken

1193
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:05,960
mystery why it can function once it's broken

1194
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:10,500
that is basically just the breaking down of the body

1195
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:15,840
and the physical is point of view so that it no longer functions properly

1196
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,840
one other point worth

1197
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:21,420
emphasizing in sketching the physical is to use this

1198
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:25,740
so they said physical is don't deny that there are mines even though we say

1199
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:30,150
we're just bodies that doesn't mean that we're just any old body is that of

1200
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:36,730
the physical view were body that you have some illusion of thinking our bodies that

1201
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:39,070
really do think

1202
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:42,490
so there really are minds

1203
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:43,730
we could

1204
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:47,100
and if it was point of view call those cells

1205
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:51,900
just like there's no danger in talking of mine from the physical is perspective the

1206
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,090
one be any serious danger in talking about us all

1207
01:13:55,140 --> 01:14:01,480
and so in certain contexts i'm perfectly comfortable in my physical is smooth i'm perfectly

1208
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,620
comfortable talking about you know

1209
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:08,780
this person always got a good solar bad so how the whole stories when i

1210
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:11,860
read shakespear or what have you that the

1211
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,920
upsetting or improper about the language of the soul

1212
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:18,400
even on the physical is point of view

1213
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:23,090
but in this class just try to keep us from getting confused as i indicated

1214
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:26,330
before and i want to remind you i'm going to say

1215
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:27,880
the word soul

1216
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:31,890
well it's trying to say the word soul but what i'm talking about the dualistic

1217
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,270
so when i put it this way

1218
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:38,890
the neutral term is going to be mined

1219
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:42,920
we all agree that people have minds

1220
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:46,240
sort of the house the seat of our personalities

1221
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:50,290
and the question is what is the mind

1222
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:55,730
and the dual this position is that the mind is the sole

1223
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:59,670
and the soul is an immaterial object

1224
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:04,310
so when i use the word so i'll try to reserve it for the metaphysical

1225
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:09,150
view according to which souls are something immaterial

1226
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:14,050
in contrast to that we've got the physical this view physical it's also believe in

1227
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:20,050
but minds are just way of talking about the abilities of the body

1228
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,300
and so they do not believe it was do not believe in any immaterial object

1229
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:26,690
above and beyond the body

1230
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,470
that's part of the person

1231
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:32,620
and so just to keep things clear i will say that

1232
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:36,730
physical this materialist do not believe in souls

1233
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:39,670
because for the purposes of this class i'm going to

1234
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:44,620
i reserve the word soul for the materialist conception of

1235
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,420
the mind

1236
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:52,550
though in another context no harm in talking about cells

1237
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,740
so this is the these are the two basic positions the dualistic view on the

1238
01:15:56,740 --> 01:16:01,340
one hand the physical is to view on the other hand the question we need

1239
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:04,640
to turn to take it that just as the dual view is the familiar one

1240
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:09,580
so it's true that the physical is view is that the familiar one you know

1241
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:13,280
whether or not you believe that you are familiar with the fact that some people

1242
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,970
believe that are least you wonder whether it's true

1243
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:23,380
the science require that we believe in the physical is to view or not

1244
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,250
the question we want to turn to then

1245
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,270
is which of these two views should we believe

1246
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:33,070
the dual is position or the physical this position

1247
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:39,840
the crucial question presumably is well should we believe in the existence of the soul

1248
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:43,300
both sides believe in bodies

1249
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:47,350
they say that the dual this position is we're understanding it is not a view

1250
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:52,420
that says there are only mind there are no bodies jules believe that their bodies

1251
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:55,530
they believe that are sold as well as bodies

1252
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:00,970
physical is believed bodies but no self so there's an agreement that there are bodies

1253
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:06,300
here's one each one of you is sort of dragging one around with you

1254
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:09,430
i disagree with those bodies the question is

1255
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,960
are there any thing

1256
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:14,060
beyond bodies is there anything beyond the body

1257
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,910
is there so other cells

1258
01:17:16,930 --> 01:17:18,040
so that's that

1259
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,840
question is going to concern for you

1260
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:24,270
a couple weeks

1261
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,330
if we ask ourselves

1262
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:31,070
what reason do we have to believe in a soul might start by asking what

1263
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:33,720
reasons do we have to believe in

1264
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:40,300
how do we prove the existence of things now for lots of familiar

1265
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:47,590
every day objects the answer is fairly straightforward we prove the existence by using our

1266
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:50,710
five senses we just seem

1267
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,560
how do i know

1268
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,930
there are chairs well

1269
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,210
there some chairs in front of me open my eyes i see them how do

1270
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:03,870
i know that there's a certain well i see it

1271
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:08,140
i can touch and i feel that

1272
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,920
how do i know that there are trees i see them how do i know

1273
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:15,460
birds i see them i hear them how do i know that there are apples

1274
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:19,890
i see that my taste and so forth and so on

1275
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,470
approach pretty clearly isn't going to work for souls

1276
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:31,190
a soul again we gotta minus metaphysical view quite which is something immaterial

1277
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:33,890
until you reach some point

1278
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,280
where delta g

1279
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,820
equals zero

1280
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:38,810
start here

1281
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:41,380
sure react

1282
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:42,070
and those

1283
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:46,950
will react form some products

1284
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,040
you however start with fewer

1285
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:56,050
you have no idea

1286
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,820
outside you will be greater than zero

1287
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:02,150
so you'll be spontaneous

1288
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,870
in the reverse

1289
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:08,730
direction of reaction

1290
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:12,530
so your products to for reactor

1291
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:15,130
so here you go this way

1292
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:18,550
here we go down this way

1293
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:23,360
and here you don't achieve greater than zero zero getting radius here

1294
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:26,490
their products

1295
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:28,330
you're making reactor

1296
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:31,750
still to this point here

1297
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,220
where delta g

1298
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:34,630
course hero

1299
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,150
and when delta equals zero

1300
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:43,650
then you are at equilibrium

1301
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:49,890
the relationship between delta genes in the directions of these reactions so the wrong thing

1302
01:19:49,890 --> 01:20:01,270
toward equilibrium

1303
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:04,260
so along with this

1304
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:07,230
think about the fact that delta g

1305
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:09,290
it's going to be changing

1306
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:15,720
the reactants and products change as the composition of the reaction mixture changes

1307
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:19,960
we start with pure react

1308
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:21,440
you're going to have to

1309
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:23,250
delta g

1310
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,220
at some point equilibrium be

1311
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:31,170
it's also possible to help i don't you for your product so i don't think

1312
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:39,230
he is going to depend on your composition of your material

1313
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,120
here are just a quick review from from monday

1314
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:46,360
necessary introduce you to this equation

1315
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:49,420
the relationship between delta g

1316
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:51,110
delta g know not that

1317
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,270
thank you

1318
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,480
which is the reaction quotient

1319
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,970
so delta g

1320
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:59,340
is there any particular point

1321
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,020
in your reactions

1322
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,180
well you know

1323
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,140
has to do with the reactor

1324
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:07,460
and products in their standard states

1325
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,630
here the reaction quotient

1326
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:15,680
and then or the gas constant and t is temperature

1327
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:18,640
so she also introduced to this on monday

1328
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:19,980
i just want to

1329
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:25,660
to review this i think she actually just talked about the gases be the same

1330
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:32,700
equations and principles apply talking about reacted in solution

1331
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,310
this reaction quotient

1332
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:39,460
the longer sort definition two

1333
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:46,900
depends on the partial pressures of reactants and products for the concentrations during solution

1334
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:52,250
so i showed you this equation just a was going to be

1335
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:53,480
and t

1336
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:56,810
and that the top of the reaction quotient

1337
01:21:56,820 --> 01:22:02,090
these products in the audience reacted so you have partial pressure

1338
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:04,660
some references

1339
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:08,920
raised to power seek to consider the stoichiometry

1340
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,780
of the reaction

1341
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:11,540
and then

1342
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:14,130
times the partial pressure of p

1343
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:17,400
raise the power against the geometry

1344
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:19,600
and the same for the reactor

1345
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:22,820
and over here the solution you're just talking about things

1346
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:27,840
in concentrations rather than partial pressures

1347
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:30,590
but then this is the reference here with be

1348
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:31,850
one or

1349
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:35,790
partial pressure one more concentration

1350
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:40,340
you often see these with the reference dropped out of the equation

1351
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:43,050
and you think you being equal to

1352
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:47,990
the partial pressure of being raised to the the partial pressure ridge

1353
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,540
and all the partial pressure of the a and b to

1354
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:53,820
the same form

1355
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,400
the concentration

1356
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:00,890
this is how you will be in general thing to remember what were your references

1357
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:02,510
are there

1358
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,570
so again she

1359
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:08,460
went over this on monday just look at it again

1360
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:10,070
so also

1361
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,650
also on monday

1362
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:15,930
we should look at this equation here

1363
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:18,000
and consider delta g

1364
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:19,690
one is equal to zero

1365
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,800
which means you are at equilibrium

1366
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:25,880
o point when delta g zero

1367
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,330
the reaction quotient

1368
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:32,160
equals k which is the equilibrium constant

1369
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:34,160
so q equals ten thousand new

1370
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:39,510
when you are at equilibrium

1371
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,120
so we can take this equation

1372
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:45,220
and substituting zero because the equilibrium

1373
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:46,460
delta g

1374
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,550
it is zero

1375
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,390
and then this equation

1376
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:52,220
and rewritten

1377
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:55,830
this brings the RTE natural log k

1378
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,730
to the other side

1379
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:01,560
and again

1380
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:03,320
the equilibrium constant

1381
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,170
it has the same form

1382
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:06,690
as you

1383
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:10,340
when you're only considering the concentrations at equilibrium

1384
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,130
so in the gaseous state

1385
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:13,910
it looks just like you

1386
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,340
these concentrations or

1387
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:23,250
partial pressures are the ones at equilibrium phase equilibrium constants and likewise the solution

1388
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:25,670
here just talking about the ratio

1389
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:32,140
of products to the reactor at equilibrium before equilibrium things to remind you

1390
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,060
these concentrations

1391
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:38,440
at equilibrium

1392
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:39,990
she also showed you

1393
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:41,500
one day

1394
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:44,340
you can rearrange

1395
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:46,260
this equation

1396
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:49,570
but they used to be popular and in high school so that you could

1397
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,360
make a bendy smooth

1398
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:52,430
smooth curve

1399
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:56,680
so what can we do next

1400
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:01,800
the demo i just showed you with twenty five odd hidden units

1401
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:06,890
i do the weights at random from a gaussian distribution i didn't tell you what the standard deviations were

1402
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:10,910
now i'm going to show you those standard deviations they were legal a moment ago

1403
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:15,220
and this screen is now showing you four equal standard deviations four

1404
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,700
the input weights

1405
01:25:17,410 --> 01:25:21,120
the bias weights and the outputs which are coloured now

1406
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:22,390
the red

1407
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:24,840
curve or

1408
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,570
three blue curves are shown you three random draws

1409
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:41,590
the gas in distribution

1410
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:45,070
right so you can see those three functions and now what i'm gonna do is

1411
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:48,840
crank up and down the standard deviation is just so you can see what effect

1412
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,220
scaling the weights about

1413
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:55,660
the random weights making bigger or smaller has on the random functions so first

1414
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:59,390
let's crank up the input weights standard deviation

1415
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,070
you see the functions have got

1416
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:02,570
more weakly

1417
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:07,950
and that sort shrunken because we've taken all the hype or hyperbolic tangents and made them all speaker

1418
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,090
and if we take

1419
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:11,430
sigma in

1420
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:15,590
the standard deviation will be weight down yet get much s

1421
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:19,550
broader functions that locally look just like straight lines

1422
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:24,910
now let's treat the bias is bias is we can

1423
01:26:25,530 --> 01:26:28,680
have big standard deviation forum now we've got lots

1424
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:29,280
the wiggles

1425
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:33,300
we can have a small standard deviation and now we get something that looks like

1426
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:36,700
it's a sum of about three or four hyperbolic tangent even though it's a function

1427
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:37,860
of a sum of twenty five

1428
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:43,430
so the standard deviation and the biases determining how many wiggles get

1429
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:45,390
but it doesn't affect

1430
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,910
be characteristic length scale of the wiggles that's being controlled by

1431
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,930
the standard deviation in the inputs

1432
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:55,620
finally crank up and down the standard deviation and the outputs this is trivial

1433
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:57,410
the functions just become

1434
01:26:58,840 --> 01:26:59,610
higher vertically

1435
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:00,490
all our

1436
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:05,120
so that's the roelof those three standard deviations

1437
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:08,970
so what we do next

1438
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:11,010
let's give ourselves data

1439
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:14,240
so just as with a single neuron

1440
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:18,890
computing the gradient and we did steepest descent on the gradient

1441
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:20,140
and we ended up

1442
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:25,970
being able to perfectly separate the five yellow petals from the five blue raisins

1443
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:29,760
we can do the same thing with the data set looks like this here of five

1444
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,820
hand we can define a new objective function

1445
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:35,950
which instead of

1446
01:27:37,570 --> 01:27:38,780
being this gene here

1447
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:44,260
is gonna be a measure for real numbers

1448
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:48,240
of how close

1449
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:53,720
the outputs of target so we have

1450
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:56,300
the neuron function like this why

1451
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:58,660
you have some target values like this

1452
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:01,300
user errors

1453
01:28:05,970 --> 01:28:06,530
is end

1454
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:07,890
is plan

1455
01:28:08,590 --> 01:28:09,360
and we can define

1456
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:12,030
call some of

1457
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,320
she and minus one

1458
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:22,050
what about measuring error could you possibly have well

1459
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:25,970
obviously other ones but this is a standard things people often some west

1460
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:28,160
and that's depends on w

1461
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:29,590
on the weights

1462
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:31,050
three uh

1463
01:28:31,090 --> 01:28:32,470
the wire ends which are all

1464
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:34,360
way dependent

1465
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:40,530
so what we do with at we say this is our objective function please make

1466
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:42,610
the output as closely as possible targets

1467
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:46,550
you compute the gradient gene which by definition is you

1468
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:48,160
by the w

1469
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:54,140
hand many people do steepest descent on the subjective functions so they follow the gradient downhill

1470
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:56,050
alright lights down

1471
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:01,680
and here's what happens after one iteration of steepest descent so i started off with

1472
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:04,300
a twenty five hidden units neural network

1473
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:05,910
shown by the blue line

1474
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,510
andrew start going downhill and after one iteration is already looking quite promising

1475
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:15,780
maybe another iteration andy two thousand three thousand eight thousand nine thousand iterations

1476
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,410
and you end up with this green thing which perfectly goes through all five data

1477
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:22,050
points and say here are brilliant i have learned

1478
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:23,050
the function

1479
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,110
from the five data points or maybe say

1480
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,180
no rubbish that's stupid

1481
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:33,760
because maybe you're dealing with noisy problem where actually what you really think is going

1482
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,300
on is that there is the true underlying function

1483
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:37,510
and the data points

1484
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,360
differ from it by some

1485
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:40,820
additive noise

1486
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:43,140
and then you be rather irritated have

1487
01:29:43,570 --> 01:29:45,720
the green curve perfectly go through every single

1488
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:47,390
detail the noise

1489
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,260
and if you are dissatisfied in a way

1490
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:51,470
what you say

1491
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:52,640
well you say

1492
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:55,660
i wanted to learning with regularization

1493
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,300
so you've changed the objective function again

1494
01:29:59,410 --> 01:29:59,800
and you say

1495
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:01,930
i need some sort regularization

1496
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:05,840
because i don't like this really function because it's a bit

1497
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,910
it's would leave and i was expecting

1498
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:11,220
the expectation about not being super-duper wiggly

1499
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,970
can be expressed perhaps with regularizer

1500
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,320
you can go back the good old regularizer

1501
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:18,530
we had a moment ago

1502
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:19,760
he w

1503
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:27,490
you can add alpha times it or maybe a bit more sophisticated and you actually

1504
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:31,340
i should is divide the weights in the classes because

1505
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:33,890
remember a moment ago the willingness

1506
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:36,010
this typical function

1507
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:42,110
a length scale is determined by the standard deviation of the input weights

1508
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,950
had a number of wiggles

1509
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:48,590
that was related to beeston deviation biases

1510
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:53,110
number wiggles in a typical function sigma bias over sigma in

1511
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,570
and it had a vertical length scale it something to do with sigma out

1512
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,530
perhaps times square root

1513
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:04,510
so since we

1514
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:06,280
input weights

1515
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:13,320
magnitude and the biases and outputs affecting things in such different ways it might make sense to have three regularizers

1516
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:15,490
one for each of these things

1517
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:17,110
and you can define

1518
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:18,910
in w

1519
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:21,780
one to be the sum of squares

1520
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:24,200
all the weights

1521
01:31:25,070 --> 01:31:25,950
summing over there

1522
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:29,180
that is

1523
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:30,370
you go to

1524
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:32,240
this element black by

1525
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:34,380
the action of an element of g

1526
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:38,090
so you are applying to acts who applied you want you go

1527
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:39,780
go here

1528
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:42,790
you applied to go here

1529
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:45,570
you may return to LAX at some point

1530
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:48,240
in your fly another element people here

1531
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,340
so everywhere you go here

1532
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:53,460
you some of the elements

1533
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:57,800
this all the elements belongs to an object

1534
01:31:58,730 --> 01:32:02,000
this is the solution of one part of it

1535
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:04,460
if you

1536
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:08,390
in the theorem that we need the definition for all of its we're going to

1537
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:10,010
do that so

1538
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:13,800
but another important point here is to

1539
01:32:13,810 --> 01:32:16,210
fix space

1540
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:19,750
this is the fix-it subspace of the element x

1541
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,820
you have an element x there

1542
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:22,920
and here

1543
01:32:22,930 --> 01:32:27,540
the fix subspaces all g element of g of the group

1544
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:29,230
that fix x

1545
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:35,010
you have of g on x and you to get x x doesn't change

1546
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,710
with live-action

1547
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:38,670
so for example in this case here

1548
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,130
it's obvious that the

1549
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:44,700
identity should be the right

1550
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:46,800
so these guys here

1551
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:48,640
this is the subset

1552
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:50,310
of the group

1553
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:53,440
four that fix the element x

1554
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:55,610
doesn't change

1555
01:32:55,670 --> 01:33:00,910
and of course you when you see subset you already know that we talking about

1556
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,430
core sets of this

1557
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:07,140
this result here

1558
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:10,660
it's called orbit stabiliser

1559
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:13,060
and it relates

1560
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:14,330
the size

1561
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:16,450
of course act

1562
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:19,070
of the subset

1563
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:23,000
with the size of the orbit

1564
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:25,830
this has intuitive

1565
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:40,790
so he

1566
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:04,290
look x here

1567
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:07,190
you should be more clear

1568
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:10,040
x is just

1569
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:17,000
x is not the group along its axis

1570
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,050
x is a point

1571
01:34:23,070 --> 01:34:25,620
right ideal acting like vector

1572
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:28,050
and g is symmetric

1573
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:31,480
some metrics times vectors

1574
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:39,140
it's it's it's you have to understand this a bit more of

1575
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:41,960
but this is

1576
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,330
this is an element they represent elements by and by

1577
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:48,200
by on

1578
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:54,030
and is that he is just represent the action of these elements on the

1579
01:34:54,050 --> 01:34:56,180
this structure

1580
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:02,620
in this in this can be having defined by you can do the action is

1581
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:04,570
a matrix multiplication

1582
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:06,730
as an operator

1583
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:12,540
not you're the action of the group will have one with light elements of the

1584
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:21,800
so here that's why i drawn this in different

1585
01:35:21,810 --> 01:35:22,880
the circle right

1586
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:24,540
the group is here

1587
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,700
and here is where

1588
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:27,600
the x gold

1589
01:35:27,610 --> 01:35:29,550
on the action of the group

1590
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:34,240
x imagine x is the vector

1591
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:34,760
so o

1592
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:38,450
so this is

1593
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:43,970
before i start to piece of group

1594
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:46,380
two names for

1595
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:47,710
and that

1596
01:35:47,730 --> 01:35:51,990
but the main thing is this in this slide here

1597
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:56,510
is that the size of this course that is the size

1598
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:05,250
and the interpretation for these intuitive interpretation is that you take a group

1599
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:06,830
they can group

1600
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:10,090
and you take out

1601
01:36:11,530 --> 01:36:15,480
that doesn't change

1602
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:16,600
in the action

1603
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:18,430
and what you get

1604
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:21,220
it's everything that moves

1605
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:26,600
that makes sense

1606
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:29,830
these is six it space

1607
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,670
gx is the

1608
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:35,560
the live fix it

1609
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:37,890
and this is the orbits

1610
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:43,620
the things that i will

1611
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:47,160
this is this arm

1612
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,830
relationship here

1613
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:56,220
this is the number of cosets

1614
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,830
the size of the course

1615
01:36:58,870 --> 01:37:00,740
the number of cosets

1616
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:04,970
and this is the size of the org

1617
01:37:04,990 --> 01:37:10,060
so you need to use these relations together with the

1618
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,970
lagrange theorem to prove the

1619
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:14,810
statement of the

1620
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:18,630
burnside theorem

1621
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:22,440
he and innovation is

1622
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:26,420
this axis here is the collection of all

1623
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:27,620
of all

1624
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:32,340
the fixed point

1625
01:37:32,410 --> 01:37:38,050
so you have the definition of extensive space for the next

1626
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,780
then you collect all taxes

1627
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:44,930
so this is a

1628
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:50,190
so this is a subset of the x

1629
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:52,070
the set of all orbits

1630
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,890
i'm giving

1631
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:56,200
by this information here

1632
01:37:56,210 --> 01:38:00,800
which is you know gx is just one orbit for one x

1633
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:03,790
and then you run through all the axis you get a one

1634
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:05,460
of this is the

1635
01:38:05,490 --> 01:38:08,510
but the number of

1636
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,320
if you remember

1637
01:38:10,330 --> 01:38:13,660
this is a good place to start because

1638
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:16,660
this is the left side of the

1639
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:18,390
the right side

1640
01:38:18,410 --> 01:38:20,960
is this here

1641
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:28,210
you know

1642
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:34,290
the trick is you can because of this identity here

1643
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:36,050
the size of this

1644
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:41,550
you know you take one x that belongs to this

1645
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:43,690
and you with one by one and his son

1646
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:46,740
in some of these axes

1647
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:50,150
then you have the size of this is a way to calculate the size of

1648
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:54,410
the sum was reduced to that

1649
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:57,080
and here you can see the change

1650
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:58,370
and then

1651
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:11,140
different people

1652
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:00,830
you want

1653
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:26,540
all right

1654
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:55,020
well we have

1655
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:57,380
and all

1656
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:15,850
so really

1657
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,750
and people

1658
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:31,960
you think

1659
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,880
so we have

1660
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:35,820
required if you're dead

1661
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:40,040
well we extracted information from the already in index

1662
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:44,630
index sweet entities attributes and relations

1663
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:47,210
also maybe

1664
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:49,810
spatial and temporal relations

1665
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:52,110
question have temporal point

1666
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:54,590
at the time points in your view

1667
01:42:55,040 --> 01:43:00,670
from which you can enforce the temporal relations but spatial relations

1668
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:02,770
here is also quite

1669
01:43:02,790 --> 01:43:05,540
you can't fix it right

1670
01:43:07,310 --> 01:43:09,380
so this here is also

1671
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:14,110
a need for this kind of technology to

1672
01:43:14,130 --> 01:43:16,980
we have all the data points

1673
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,110
you might call his natural language

1674
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:29,340
let's go back to the more classical question think you have a question who is

1675
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:37,000
the architect and you want to find the document collection the answer to your question

1676
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:39,340
so i general procedures

1677
01:43:39,340 --> 01:43:40,460
you analyse

1678
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:44,400
and you try to find from the

1679
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:46,230
finding the question

1680
01:43:46,250 --> 01:43:49,130
as much information as possible

1681
01:43:49,170 --> 01:43:53,250
so first of all you have a large document collections

1682
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:54,810
you will not analyse

1683
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:59,150
try to analyse or what you will not try to make your question

1684
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,810
and sentence in the document collection

1685
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:08,520
it would be much too slow if you think analyses

1686
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:11,110
and of course if you want to select so filter

1687
01:44:11,210 --> 01:44:13,860
and from the document collection

1688
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:19,440
that might contain the answer to question so you actually

1689
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:25,920
common retrieval on this and so so you to understand from your collection that might

1690
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:27,580
contain answer

1691
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:32,890
and then you can perform a linguistic more in-depth analyses of your question

1692
01:44:34,170 --> 01:44:35,610
among the

1693
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:39,350
as part of this more in-depth analyses of your question

1694
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:41,430
you might be to

1695
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:45,430
the type of questions so here who which

1696
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:50,930
so who is related to a person we have to find a person name

1697
01:44:50,930 --> 01:44:52,880
reference person

1698
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:56,300
as an answer to a question

1699
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,790
we do the same

1700
01:44:57,810 --> 01:45:00,130
he performed analyse

1701
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:10,880
also for the answer sentences in the document collection

1702
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:14,680
and then we

1703
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:17,520
we select and rank

1704
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:21,230
so also in the standards of document collections

1705
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:23,010
we have

1706
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,050
we try to find the expected and such

1707
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:32,140
if we are looking for persons we should do named entity called recognition in our

1708
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:33,930
document collection

1709
01:45:33,930 --> 01:45:35,140
and find

1710
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:38,590
and find a person named in this

1711
01:45:38,610 --> 01:45:43,600
person names in the centre of the collection

1712
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:45,080
so we tried to do

1713
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:48,000
as well as we could

1714
01:45:48,010 --> 01:45:52,920
from which we extract the and expected answer type

1715
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:55,720
and in my summary for h

1716
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:57,720
so you see another

1717
01:45:58,060 --> 01:46:00,430
more schematic overview

1718
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:03,640
so we have questions like

1719
01:46:04,390 --> 01:46:08,350
so how how much

1720
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:09,720
what it calls

1721
01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:13,180
two events looks like that for a while

1722
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:15,340
for one day

1723
01:46:17,130 --> 01:46:20,210
well in nineteen ninety six

1724
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:21,720
o clock

1725
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,390
how much would it cost

1726
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:24,760
so first of all

1727
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:26,500
we do

1728
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:30,320
let our question to keyword

1729
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:34,250
which we use also to

1730
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:40,220
retrieve relevant citations valid sentence from our collection to analyse

1731
01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:44,050
but we can go deeper into the question and

1732
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:45,250
so we can

1733
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:47,800
the question presentation

1734
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:52,540
we can derive the expected answer type

1735
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:54,710
or the question type

1736
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,190
it's quite so

1737
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:57,540
because these terms

1738
01:46:57,540 --> 01:47:02,050
somehow changed

1739
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:05,300
when you speak about question time and time

1740
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:08,230
determine the posterior given the data

1741
01:47:08,450 --> 01:47:16,000
and if you remember this this theorem about the existence of the density than that

1742
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,240
said that that this measure has to be absolutely continuous with respect to this measure

1743
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,690
for this density to exist so what that meant was

1744
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:25,540
whenever the prior puts

1745
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:28,530
put zero mostel in any event

1746
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:32,010
then the posterior will also have to put zero mostel

1747
01:47:32,090 --> 01:47:34,350
otherwise pointless reweighting doesn't work

1748
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:40,120
and you see that this is not explicitly mentioned as a condition for

1749
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:44,880
so one of the nice things about the theorem is that what it tells you

1750
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,210
is if this condition holds

1751
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:50,480
then this condition of absolute continuity here is implied by the

1752
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:52,300
you don't have to check it

1753
01:47:57,660 --> 01:47:58,800
good but

1754
01:48:00,490 --> 01:48:03,600
another consequence here of of of this

1755
01:48:03,630 --> 01:48:06,970
being actually being in density of the properties of the posteriors with respect to the

1756
01:48:06,970 --> 01:48:07,860
prior is

1757
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:11,850
that if this absolute continuity condition is not satisfied

1758
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,710
then we don't have the basic wage

1759
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:17,900
we don't we don't have this density there's nothing like this equation

1760
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:24,350
in basically an finite dimensional models that never happens

1761
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:28,940
any any parametric model finite dimensional space on what can think of

1762
01:48:28,990 --> 01:48:30,120
but what happened

1763
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:35,000
one model but actually happens is the directly process on the real line

1764
01:48:35,030 --> 01:48:37,030
and so that's what we have already

1765
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:40,720
if we if we define that the director process with continuous base measure on the

1766
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:43,660
real line or an interval continuous set

1767
01:48:44,370 --> 01:48:46,850
actually this posterior here is not

1768
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:51,850
it's not absolutely continuous with respect to the prior then we don't have basically

1769
01:48:51,890 --> 01:48:54,400
so you might have wondered about why i mean if you if you have already

1770
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,820
seen a bit of tricky process literature then you always see the sampling equation for

1771
01:48:57,850 --> 01:49:01,370
the process posterior but you never see anything like

1772
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:05,120
the bayes equation may have it directly prior over here and iterative process during process

1773
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:09,000
prior over here and then some all and then some thirty process posterior

1774
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:11,900
and the reason is that this equation is not

1775
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:13,090
not defined

1776
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:27,480
so you say if if this derivative here exists

1777
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:31,800
this if this this thing is well defined as the implied

1778
01:49:31,990 --> 01:49:36,540
no so actually in order when you start when you start from

1779
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:38,870
from the prior here

1780
01:49:38,870 --> 01:49:42,670
then you need some some notion of what x look like looks like in order

1781
01:49:42,670 --> 01:49:45,090
to define the posterior in the first place

1782
01:49:45,110 --> 01:49:48,530
right you need so you need to define x in order to

1783
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:51,640
to define the posterior x also defines this

1784
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:56,000
if you have a posterior defined and this is also defined

1785
01:49:56,020 --> 01:49:58,760
but it's defined in an abstract sense and you don't know how

1786
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:01,700
you don't know know how to get from here to here in any

1787
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:04,490
any computational or even analytic

1788
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:07,950
so when i'm saying here that that this model doesn't have these equations are not

1789
01:50:07,950 --> 01:50:12,450
talking about the problem of what people call an intractable posterior

1790
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:17,000
intractable posterior is if the space equation exists and if this integral down here is

1791
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,860
hard to compute

1792
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:20,990
or does not have a closed form

1793
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,940
does not have a closed form solution

1794
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:24,430
and this he says

1795
01:50:24,450 --> 01:50:29,490
there are some cases where we're actually this this equation simply make

1796
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,500
you me OK so

1797
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:42,540
the question is

1798
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:45,650
when we have density it always has to be with respect to some measure brain

1799
01:50:46,110 --> 01:50:48,080
and says so so

1800
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:50,900
the condition is there must be some measure

1801
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:51,970
any measure

1802
01:50:51,990 --> 01:50:53,150
such that

1803
01:50:53,170 --> 01:50:56,190
if you look at this as a family of distributions for each value of the

1804
01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:57,500
parameter to get

1805
01:50:57,550 --> 01:50:59,540
you get a distribution here

1806
01:50:59,550 --> 01:51:03,300
for each one of the parameters this is this is one measure on x

1807
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:04,420
the flag

1808
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:08,510
figure and ground birds and fish at the centre but now this flow is with

1809
01:51:08,510 --> 01:51:13,160
respect to point cemetery each figure of balls

1810
01:51:13,910 --> 01:51:17,560
matched by figure below imperfect point cemetery

1811
01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:25,990
so again the figure and ground but with different layout in symmetry

1812
01:51:26,030 --> 01:51:30,870
this is probably actually is most famous for this is called day and night

1813
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:33,730
obviously again dualistic title

1814
01:51:33,870 --> 01:51:38,720
and here with respect to run it seems as though this mural line in the

1815
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:43,350
here you have a bright but hamlet

1816
01:51:43,370 --> 01:51:49,150
along the little river and over here you have its nighttime mirror image

1817
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:51,050
and it seems as though

1818
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:57,750
the dot product of birds bats flying over the summer village is mirrored by the

1819
01:51:57,770 --> 01:52:00,060
flock of light colored birds

1820
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:03,360
flying over the nighttime landscape

1821
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:05,460
in fact

1822
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:11,330
these birds are not reflected images of the birds of the tails

1823
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:13,740
the white birds have tails down

1824
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:16,700
the blackbirds have tails up

1825
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:22,270
it is because of the need to have it that way to make them rock

1826
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:27,560
in the centre but still it's not perfect mirror images of each other but this

1827
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:35,040
is a very nice again dualistic painting not painting the footprint rather

1828
01:52:35,090 --> 01:52:37,260
this is a very complex

1829
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:43,080
presentation of the dualism of convex and concave

1830
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:45,500
and that's the name of this print

1831
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:50,250
and again this is a kind of neuron here

1832
01:52:50,260 --> 01:52:51,970
the balance is the two

1833
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:53,840
on the left

1834
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:59,230
you have a view that if you're standing up here we're looking down

1835
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:06,150
you're looking down and over here on the right you're looking up

1836
01:53:06,170 --> 01:53:09,980
and depending on your viewpoint

1837
01:53:09,990 --> 01:53:16,010
at the centre things can be either convex or concave i'm not going to point

1838
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:17,880
out one you have this

1839
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:23,150
this is the prince you want to look at again and again because each time

1840
01:53:23,150 --> 01:53:25,440
you do you'll discover some new things

1841
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:30,770
look at this from from the viewpoint of a woman who was going down the

1842
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:35,170
she's going down the staircase

1843
01:53:35,190 --> 01:53:36,280
and this is the

1844
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:42,240
at the bottom of the staircase and indented into that war is the whole fluted

1845
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,830
on the other hand

1846
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:49,480
if you look at this

1847
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,220
from underneath

1848
01:53:51,230 --> 01:53:55,740
now we are down on the next row and we're looking

1849
01:53:56,700 --> 01:54:01,850
is this set of stripes the underside of an alcove but this is also a

1850
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:05,330
set of stripes that the is the underside of an alcove

1851
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,710
right here

1852
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:10,030
and when you look at it from below

1853
01:54:10,090 --> 01:54:12,620
so this is a con

1854
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:13,840
the next

1855
01:54:15,070 --> 01:54:18,430
plaster ornament coming out of the ceiling

1856
01:54:18,430 --> 01:54:21,210
it was the same thing which is convex

1857
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:23,850
which is concave and so forth

1858
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:28,600
ensure again love to play with these relativistic point of view in in this case

1859
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:34,840
he's put them together to get to this duality of convex and concave

1860
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:40,550
another aspect of symmetry

1861
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:45,600
if we had describe

1862
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:51,130
one aspect of symmetry would certainly say symmetry has to do with literally no

1863
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:53,840
actually himself

1864
01:54:53,870 --> 01:54:54,690
it was

1865
01:54:54,770 --> 01:55:02,470
only person interested in order this particular printer his is named

1866
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,630
the order and chaos

1867
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:07,190
and you is kind of something you know you

1868
01:55:07,390 --> 01:55:09,910
the sort of kind a bunch

1869
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:12,560
discarded stuff

1870
01:55:12,580 --> 01:55:16,570
and in the centre is this beautiful crystal like

1871
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:18,260
global with

1872
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:21,040
a list nodes

1873
01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:23,520
the do that

1874
01:55:23,530 --> 01:55:29,230
coming through it and you can see in this some of the reflections of these

1875
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:30,930
that's of debris

1876
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:32,000
around it

1877
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:34,470
so here is kind of summing up

1878
01:55:35,810 --> 01:55:42,870
and care

1879
01:55:42,890 --> 01:55:45,020
having to do with water also

1880
01:55:45,030 --> 01:55:48,210
it has to do with quality

1881
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:50,550
and as you know

1882
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:56,330
regular and semi-regular polyhedra they show up in several of his prints this one is

1883
01:55:56,330 --> 01:55:59,060
just called stars

1884
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:06,270
if you notice the stars are in fact some of the regular platonic solids

1885
01:56:06,510 --> 01:56:09,530
and some of the

1886
01:56:09,550 --> 01:56:16,670
uniform polyhedra and some of the compounds some very difficult compounds this one that funny

1887
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:18,390
lizard like creatures

1888
01:56:18,530 --> 01:56:20,690
sticking through

1889
01:56:20,690 --> 01:56:23,740
is actually a compound of two

1890
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:26,320
after heater

1891
01:56:26,350 --> 01:56:30,940
he also

1892
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,630
this is very beautiful

1893
01:56:35,660 --> 01:56:37,500
when you

1894
01:56:38,230 --> 01:56:39,210
o where

1895
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:43,270
based on

1896
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:49,290
during which he found in the mathematics book by max brooks there

1897
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:52,660
and this is a compound

1898
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:56,190
o five regular tetrahedra

1899
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:03,230
the company of course the tetrahedra regular approach their interests they are intertwined compound in

1900
01:57:03,230 --> 01:57:03,840
such a way

1901
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:07,890
that's why have come here are not perfect

1902
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:11,050
five fold symmetric point

1903
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:14,490
and he is captured this very same symmetry

1904
01:57:14,530 --> 01:57:21,800
with this thing he did this with several carvings you'll see some others later

1905
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:28,020
he explored the regular division of space this is called cubic space division

1906
01:57:28,030 --> 01:57:31,940
and he also explore the regular division of space

1907
01:57:31,970 --> 01:57:36,090
with respect to concentrate

1908
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:44,660
spherical shells here

1909
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:49,140
and of course what should probably is most well known for

1910
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:52,340
his his pilings or tabulations

1911
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:54,840
if you say the word elation

1912
01:57:54,890 --> 01:57:57,220
almost everyone says asher

1913
01:57:58,230 --> 01:58:03,320
here you have regularity but you also have

1914
01:58:04,580 --> 01:58:07,510
and this is another aspect of symmetry

1915
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:11,780
symmetry as regular repetition of like elements

1916
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:18,790
and in this room probably translations this one is very well he actually produced a

1917
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:24,840
silk print of this that is quite beautiful with these fish actually swim in

1918
01:58:24,860 --> 01:58:33,210
in our intertwining with then streams and this is the print on which those based

1919
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:35,950
solely have regular repetition

1920
01:58:35,950 --> 01:58:37,860
stochastic gradient descent

1921
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:41,880
so the bottom line is can do this very fast

1922
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:45,880
and to show you what we can do for example we can think it being

1923
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:49,980
a network like seventy five thousand dollars and half million edges

1924
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,500
if you ask what the space of four

1925
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:55,790
what node correspondences it's like that one million

1926
01:58:55,810 --> 01:58:59,920
but this is by setting just a small fraction of these actually it takes two

1927
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:04,970
hours to estimate the parameters so this is our parameter these are our parameter estimates

1928
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,930
and refuses to generate a synthetic graph and then you

1929
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:12,180
compare the properties for example degree distributions

1930
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:14,890
cumulative distribution of plants

1931
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:18,650
or distribution of the first singular vector

1932
01:59:18,670 --> 01:59:20,890
you can see that the matching

1933
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:25,430
the reality quite well so basically matching the statistics of these networks

1934
01:59:25,470 --> 01:59:27,380
quite well even though we didn't

1935
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:31,110
specifically said we want to measure the vision and we want to mention is that

1936
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:34,330
we just said we want justice image is much

1937
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:36,920
this now

1938
01:59:36,970 --> 01:59:38,310
is the first time

1939
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:41,970
so basically what i show you some observations on evolving

1940
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:47,190
network special about how to how you alleges that touched on how to create a

1941
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:51,450
synthetic networks now i want to show you were confiscated

1942
01:59:51,790 --> 01:59:57,160
so what i mean by cascade is bayes basically behaviors that cascade propagates from node

1943
01:59:57,160 --> 02:00:01,020
to node in the network like an epidemic and there are many natural examples of

1944
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:03,170
so for example the epinions

1945
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:09,930
rumors were news are something that problem is easily recommendation so word-of-mouth marketing is another

1946
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:14,540
infectious diseases again like flu you have to

1947
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:19,710
come contact with someone in fact there is another example and then sort sort of

1948
02:00:19,710 --> 02:00:26,410
twenty b when such behaviors propagate the through the network they believe that based on

1949
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,850
for these traits scale

1950
02:00:28,850 --> 02:00:32,390
so the idea is that if i have an network

1951
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:34,700
and then i have started

1952
02:00:34,730 --> 02:00:40,950
then this activation propagates through the network

1953
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,230
and basically

1954
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,400
but there is the

1955
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:45,990
propagation graph i call a cascade

1956
02:00:48,050 --> 02:00:49,880
now i can go and study this

1957
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:54,150
the structure so what i'll show you next is basically two examples where work such

1958
02:00:54,150 --> 02:01:00,020
propagations naturally happens and you can actually obtained a credit basically we can obtain a

1959
02:01:00,020 --> 02:01:01,780
lot of such propagations

1960
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:06,220
so first setting for which we had a was this by marketing setting

1961
02:01:06,270 --> 02:01:11,300
twenty percent and receiving commendations on products and they also purchased products so the idea

1962
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:15,420
is to use data comes from one large online store when a person comes by

1963
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:18,530
the product when they buy a product they get the choice to recommend it to

1964
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:21,570
the friends get email they can come back

1965
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:24,710
but just the product and so on so the idea is a person comes by

1966
02:01:24,710 --> 02:01:27,020
the product makes recommendations

1967
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:28,230
the other person

1968
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:31,060
decides to accept the recommendation by the product

1969
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:33,900
they get ten percent discount for his

1970
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:37,860
this person gets ten percent credit for making the successful recommendations

1971
02:01:37,870 --> 02:01:39,030
they both happy

1972
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:43,380
and the whole process propagates OK so this is the first step and for this

1973
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:44,690
we we have data

1974
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:50,380
from anonymous large online retailers like four million people sixteen million of such a combination

1975
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:54,800
event and half a million products so basically books dvds music and videos

1976
02:01:54,830 --> 02:01:56,960
OK so this is the first setting

1977
02:01:56,970 --> 02:01:58,210
and the second thing

1978
02:01:58,220 --> 02:01:59,330
is the blogosphere

1979
02:01:59,350 --> 02:02:01,420
right so we have a blog

1980
02:02:01,470 --> 02:02:02,220
like here

1981
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:06,100
and now we would like to trace how information propagates through the blogosphere so the

1982
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:07,260
idea is that

1983
02:02:07,730 --> 02:02:13,390
the machine learning theory blog which is very popular in the enterprise writes a blog

1984
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:18,790
right post and then slams the scholarly says a general something very good so

1985
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:24,990
now other blogs in the blogosphere discover maybe maybe both popular and again site OK

1986
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:29,000
in this way the information propagates so we said this piece of information are propagated

1987
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:33,260
to stand on the southern and then again some other block write posts but they

1988
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:34,490
can propagate

1989
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:38,350
in in a different way again and sees everything this time stamp them you can

1990
02:02:38,350 --> 02:02:42,940
go through all these blocked both we can actually get the traces of this information

1991
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:48,710
and they used here was banned for than point five million both sixteen million links

1992
02:02:48,710 --> 02:02:49,730
between them

1993
02:02:49,750 --> 02:02:52,510
i mean this was like for about fifty thousand blog

1994
02:02:52,530 --> 02:02:55,300
in two thousand six

1995
02:02:55,670 --> 02:03:00,270
so the first question that you can ask is how this propagation that's this cascade

1996
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:03,640
of the like right we see like long strings

1997
02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:08,110
well just somebody just cite your sources and we have this like long strings of

1998
02:03:08,110 --> 02:03:12,700
of propagation i seen starts maybe which is so that says something a lot of

1999
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:15,760
people cite but nothing else happens and so on

2000
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:22,970
so you going get this sort of frequent cascades frequent cascade subgraphs for

2001
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:27,200
what you can see what you see is the the light bulb

2002
02:03:27,210 --> 02:03:32,560
top ten of them were information propagates down and this is they are decreasing ordered

2003
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:34,050
by decreasing frequency

2004
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:38,850
so and the action selection is that this post created a hyperlink to the post

2005
02:03:38,850 --> 02:03:42,460
of about so information propagates from the top down

2006
02:03:42,870 --> 02:03:45,870
so these are the information escapes from blogosphere

2007
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:49,920
but you also take wider marketing basket so for example is a DVD recommendations not

2008
02:03:50,110 --> 02:03:54,190
well where the sum up again i'm putting them in the decreasing frequency but now

2009
02:03:54,210 --> 02:03:57,790
the semantic of the means that this person made the recommendation to that person that

2010
02:03:57,790 --> 02:03:59,660
person what OK so

2011
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:01,050
one here

2012
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:05,990
in both cases the recommendations sort of the influence propagates down what you can you

2013
02:04:05,990 --> 02:04:10,130
can make two observations so the first one is basically that lot marketing cascades that

2014
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:13,740
sort of more social so what i mean by that we we have these collisions

2015
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:19,450
get more people to recommendations from the same product from multiple different people

2016
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:24,650
while in blogosphere this correspond to summarise i mean there's a blog who who cites

2017
02:04:24,650 --> 02:04:28,990
three different posts in some cases and we don't see such things in the blogosphere

2018
02:04:28,990 --> 02:04:30,200
and the second thing is

2019
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:35,120
the marketing cascades are much more or much richer so we we have a nice

2020
02:04:35,130 --> 02:04:41,080
each non tree like structures one the blogosphere and things like three RR start to

2021
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:43,770
OK so this is the empirical

2022
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:46,250
the second thing that

2023
02:04:46,270 --> 02:04:51,400
i want to show is based on this very basic question which is basically what

2024
02:04:51,410 --> 02:04:56,220
how the probability of adoption depends on the number of friends who have already so

2025
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:59,070
the question is what's the probability of buying and i was given the number of

2026
02:04:59,070 --> 02:05:02,140
your friends the following the nine OK

2027
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:05,660
if you know what is the shape of this kind of thing can be like

2028
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:07,930
that much more accurate models and so on

2029
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:11,510
OK and that are the hypothesis so the first hypothesis would say that

2030
02:05:11,530 --> 02:05:16,460
if i put the number of friends already online versus your probability of winning it

2031
02:05:16,470 --> 02:05:20,840
it would be some kind of diminishing to strike your probability of falling only slowly

2032
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:24,620
decreases as as as more of your friends have

2033
02:05:24,820 --> 02:05:29,290
so that's hypothesis the one that also makes lots of sense is critical mass critical

2034
02:05:29,290 --> 02:05:33,650
threshold idea the idea would be that you don't really mind until a critical number

2035
02:05:33,650 --> 02:05:35,140
you what that later

2036
02:05:35,180 --> 02:05:38,600
it was that OK for integration by parts

2037
02:05:38,670 --> 02:05:42,170
and then now i'm going to be of now i can combine that with this

2038
02:05:42,170 --> 02:05:43,680
value of x

2039
02:05:45,350 --> 02:05:46,720
put them together

2040
02:05:46,730 --> 02:05:51,890
so that all that stuff is multiplying v VAT

2041
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:57,300
and then this is the boundary term i'm

2042
02:05:57,310 --> 02:05:59,600
budging on for the moment

2043
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:03,830
now what do you say

2044
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:06,140
then there done that's right

2045
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:10,270
this quantity

2046
02:06:10,290 --> 02:06:13,600
as supposed to be always positive

2047
02:06:13,600 --> 02:06:15,800
so what's my conclusions

2048
02:06:15,850 --> 02:06:19,970
this is possibly the singers this thing is never negative

2049
02:06:19,970 --> 02:06:24,910
no matter what BMX i'd shoot

2050
02:06:24,910 --> 02:06:26,430
it has to be

2051
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:27,810
it has to be easier

2052
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:31,120
it has to be zero that's the conclusion i one

2053
02:06:31,150 --> 02:06:36,020
that's the key that the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations when you get

2054
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:37,520
this expression

2055
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:39,780
but that has that has

2056
02:06:39,830 --> 02:06:42,910
that can never be negative

2057
02:06:42,910 --> 02:06:49,030
only positive or zero then sends v x has signed here sign

2058
02:06:49,090 --> 02:06:52,960
the only way you know it in this endeavor

2059
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:58,900
we can give BMX which were free to choose we can give the x the

2060
02:06:58,910 --> 02:07:03,420
signed the same sign or the opposite sign we can choose the sign of the

2061
02:07:04,420 --> 02:07:06,490
and get a contradiction

2062
02:07:06,540 --> 02:07:08,390
so that's the conclusion

2063
02:07:09,850 --> 02:07:12,530
has to be

2064
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:17,900
zero and that this quantity this integral

2065
02:07:17,930 --> 02:07:19,710
this integral

2066
02:07:19,910 --> 02:07:23,870
and no this concept that the integral and has to be zero at every point

2067
02:07:23,870 --> 02:07:27,220
because we can choose the effects

2068
02:07:27,230 --> 02:07:28,410
that's the

2069
02:07:28,460 --> 02:07:32,790
this is the DPD you we were looking for only

2070
02:07:32,850 --> 02:07:34,080
i'm using

2071
02:07:34,090 --> 02:07:38,450
it's the first variation rather than the first derivative we just use the word

2072
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:40,470
variation as a reminder

2073
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:46,540
we're dealing with functions were in continuous variables

2074
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:50,710
the the so the big moment has just

2075
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:53,540
it's just there

2076
02:07:55,700 --> 02:07:57,340
there is

2077
02:07:57,430 --> 02:08:01,170
good at what happened to this guy

2078
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:06,260
yes no you're absolutely right so there there are two points that i have

2079
02:08:06,270 --> 02:08:10,300
not dealt with one is that one so let's deal with them

2080
02:08:10,310 --> 02:08:14,280
OK now how to deal with that

2081
02:08:14,330 --> 02:08:19,290
the reason is always the same that this saying we're our reasoning is that this

2082
02:08:19,290 --> 02:08:24,510
thing has to be greater equal zero for all the

2083
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:27,850
now that we want to conclude that this thing has to be zero that's is

2084
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:32,760
fundamental fact now how what's house are thinking of the

2085
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:39,530
why why can we forget this which

2086
02:08:39,660 --> 02:08:44,510
well yeah but

2087
02:08:49,150 --> 02:08:52,530
it's always positive tribe and we we

2088
02:08:53,060 --> 02:08:58,130
this business

2089
02:08:58,150 --> 02:09:02,300
how do we how do we deal with well you probably say i don't want

2090
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:06,010
to hear any more about calculus but how did we

2091
02:09:06,050 --> 02:09:09,900
how can we deal with the difference between these was

2092
02:09:09,930 --> 02:09:11,790
was delta x

2093
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:13,660
f prime of x

2094
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:18,180
plus then they were really more terms or there there was delta x

2095
02:09:18,230 --> 02:09:22,530
square over two have with double prime that's that's the kind of term we're looking

2096
02:09:22,530 --> 02:09:23,610
at here

2097
02:09:23,630 --> 02:09:28,340
but how why was it but the this they had to be zero

2098
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:33,800
and that that i didn't have to worry about this stuff

2099
02:09:33,860 --> 02:09:37,030
and then we give me answer the question

2100
02:09:37,050 --> 02:09:38,500
take the

2101
02:09:38,510 --> 02:09:42,240
since these arbitrary take a very small

2102
02:09:42,290 --> 02:09:43,800
the to be

2103
02:09:43,860 --> 02:09:47,050
whatever sign we want to have it quite

2104
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:50,040
make its magnitude really small

2105
02:09:52,490 --> 02:09:54,420
so that's the good idea there

2106
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:58,030
i think of is just a little changed

2107
02:09:59,260 --> 02:10:01,660
if this was zero

2108
02:10:01,700 --> 02:10:06,170
we would get something right we get something in this part

2109
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:11,320
we get something here but it would be

2110
02:10:11,390 --> 02:10:13,770
second order

2111
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:19,090
so it's the sign of this would control

2112
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:21,150
there's a subtle

2113
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:27,140
now the but but the u s exactly the right question and the answer is

2114
02:10:27,170 --> 02:10:31,410
that because this has of v squared in it

2115
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:36,530
when i think of the as being just a small perturbations this guy can

2116
02:10:36,570 --> 02:10:39,960
it doesn't affect our reasoning

2117
02:10:39,990 --> 02:10:44,730
it is it it is true that it could be positive but got positive and

2118
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:50,450
so small compared to the other one that the other one that that that's in

2119
02:10:54,230 --> 02:11:01,870
yeah like that's true maybe i want to take these

2120
02:11:02,750 --> 02:11:07,990
as well as small that the beauty is i'm i'm allowed b

2121
02:11:08,030 --> 02:11:13,540
and and so that's what the limits when you get that much freedom

2122
02:11:13,550 --> 02:11:18,330
the only way out is for the thing that multiplies the these

2123
02:11:18,580 --> 02:11:20,000
that's that's right

2124
02:11:20,010 --> 02:11:24,200
that you're you're making a good point that well i could be could be small

2125
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:33,390
i mean a mathematician might say replace by epsilon times v

2126
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:34,540
so what the

2127
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:37,130
replace v by epsilon b

2128
02:11:37,140 --> 02:11:41,250
and then this would be and would have an epsilon squared in

2129
02:11:41,290 --> 02:11:43,510
we you want to see any of that

2130
02:11:47,330 --> 02:11:53,130
sorry if

2131
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:58,320
o is right of yet but this seem negative

2132
02:11:58,340 --> 02:12:04,640
no i i built in way back to the original problem i see with positive

2133
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:09,210
just the way our matrix capital city was that what had to be symmetric positive

2134
02:12:10,170 --> 02:12:11,890
diagonal thing here

2135
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:16,950
on law would go backwards in the world with

2136
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:18,530
a lot of k

2137
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:24,740
right but that's your absolutely right that that if c in other words let me

2138
02:12:24,820 --> 02:12:27,270
say because you're quite right
