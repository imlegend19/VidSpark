1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
start with

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,810
to prove it

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,510
in order to

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,680
make prove discovery

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,990
in the calculus like this

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,390
humanly feasible

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,990
computers like this calculate the two but with that

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,840
people don't

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,410
we need more help

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,510
we're not going to try and millions of possible consequences

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,400
see if the

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,490
goal turns out we don't reason like that

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,610
so in order to help

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,840
what we need to establish

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,600
is the fundamental

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,660
theorem about this calculus

17
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,510
let's call the deduction theorem

18
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,750
or deduction equivalents

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,110
sometimes called

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,330
for any

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,660
so gamma

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,650
any you only be set of formulae go

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,120
any formula nb

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,400
and tales

25
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,260
if a then b

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,530
if and only if

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,430
gamma and a together

28
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,010
until b

29
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,250
notation here

30
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,770
should be simple

31
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,310
when i write gamma i

32
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,450
i mean gamma

33
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,510
right but i write with a comma

34
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,440
to save cluster

35
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,480
just before we prove this what does it say

36
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,550
the implication here is that if a then b

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,330
it's supposed to be a kind of inference ticket

38
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,000
or you can cash it for an inference from a to b

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,140
if you have a you can use this to get to be

40
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,790
and this says

41
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,790
suppose you have a

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,290
you can get to be

43
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:22,280
but a valid argument may be in the content in the context of some parameters

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,410
and so

45
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,550
that holds exactly when the that

46
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,600
the implication that the whole story about

47
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,310
as a connective

48
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,510
so how do we establish this well we argue from left to right and right

49
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,170
to left to to to

50
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,140
two directional bidirectional things like all these proofs in logic one directions is in the

51
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,700
other direction is not

52
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,760
left to right i guess is easy

53
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,470
if from gamma we can derive

54
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,260
the conditional

55
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,600
OK so we've got our derivation

56
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,990
starting with gamma

57
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,740
and we've got a implies b

58
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,290
then from gamma ray well we can throw in a is well because it's one

59
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,290
of the assumptions here

60
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,790
we can get the OK that's it

61
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,690
one step and as just immediate consequence

62
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,470
we allow the a because it's one of the assumptions

63
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,360
so left to right there's nothing to

64
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,680
to do

65
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,210
right to left

66
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,410
is another story

67
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,050
so supposing we've got the derivation here it may have any structure may be of

68
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,020
any length

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,520
we don't know what axioms it uses what's inside it

70
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,570
if we have such derivations then there will be a derivation of this

71
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,310
and this is the formula that doesn't occur it also is not completely obvious out

72
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,740
i to do this how how we got to convert this derivation into the derivation

73
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,740
well we prove it

74
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,810
as we prove everything by induction on something or other

75
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,960
and we prove by induction

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,850
on the length of

77
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,290
this assumption here is that we have the derivation of the right hand side

78
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:21,010
so we suppose

79
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,330
the game and a we can derive b

80
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:29,240
this derivation must be of some length and

81
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,060
and we show by induction on n

82
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,360
that there is a derivation

83
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,520
of the

84
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,750
the base case is

85
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,560
splits into several sub cases base case and equals one

86
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,850
suppose we have a derivation of length one

87
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,800
that doesn't involve notion of immediate consequence at all

88
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,220
then the derivation looks like this

89
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,190
and that's the derivation of b

90
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,490
from gamma and

91
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,410
so everything in there

92
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,000
it is either an axiom of logic

93
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,000
or is

94
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,300
a member of gamma

95
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,050
or is the formula

96
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,590
if b

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,770
is an axiom of logic

98
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,450
or if he is a member of gamma

99
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,440
then we appeal to axiom one

100
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,540
of that

101
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,200
OK we take

102
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,050
axiom one

103
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,060
then if a then b that's just interchanging the roles of a and b that

104
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,780
and we have the which is

105
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,270
an axiom of logic or a member of gamma

106
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,800
we derive

107
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,280
if a then b

108
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,280
this is an axiom

109
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,010
this is either an axiom

110
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,930
or is in gamma

111
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,230
and so that's the derivation of this from

112
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,950
i like

113
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:28,240
that's the case the other base cases where b is actually the formula

114
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,120
because that's allowed as well that the derivation of b from gamma and a

115
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,240
it just indicates that i be the same formula

116
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,830
but in that case

117
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,470
so in the case

118
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,710
equals b

119
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,520
in that case

120
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,900
they are OBE a implies b

121
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,100
is just

122
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,610
a implies that a

123
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,240
and that's derivable from the empty set we just did

124
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,510
so gamma

125
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,700
in that case entails

126
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,080
a implies a for any gummy like

127
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,270
that's a implies b

128
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,600
because it's the same formula

129
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,640
so those are all the base cases

130
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,970
then there's the induction case

131
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,120
suppose that this

132
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,220
after this

133
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,750
deduction theorem holds

134
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,470
for all the derivations

135
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,890
shorter than

136
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,540
for everything is derivable in less than n

137
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,990
that combination i i'm i know log get zero but the

138
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,330
the question is does any other combination gives zero if not

139
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:51,080
then the vectors are independent if some other combination does give zero vectors are dependent

140
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,630
let's just take examples

141
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,490
i suppose i'm in

142
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,740
say in two dimensional space

143
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,190
i give you i'd like to first take an example let me take an example

144
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,130
where i have a vector

145
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,560
and twice the vector

146
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,520
so that's too

147
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,180
vectors of the an two v

148
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,010
are those dependent or independent

149
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:26,610
those are dependent for sure right there's a combination one vectors twice the other

150
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,430
one vector is twice as long as the other so if there were dependent means

151
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,110
anything these should be dependent and they are

152
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,750
and in fact i would take

153
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,050
two of the first so here's

154
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,640
is the vector v

155
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,040
and the other guys vector to v

156
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,020
that's my

157
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,610
so there the vector v one

158
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,890
my that my next vector v two is to be one of course those are

159
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,550
dependent because

160
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,100
two of these

161
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,220
first vectors minus the second factor is zero

162
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,120
that's a combination

163
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,220
of these two vectors it gives the zero vector OK that was clear

164
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,680
suppose i have a vector

165
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,310
here's another example

166
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,250
easy example suppose i have a vector

167
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,900
and the other guys the zero vector suppose i have the vector v one

168
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,200
and the two

169
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,120
is the zero vector

170
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,590
then i those vectors

171
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,540
dependent or independent

172
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,380
they're dependent again

173
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,450
you could say well this guy

174
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,750
it is zero times that one

175
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,360
this one is some combination of but let me write it the other way let

176
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,230
me say what combination how many the ones

177
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,500
and how many the tools

178
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,990
well i take to get the zero vector

179
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,700
if v one is like the vector to one

180
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,460
and the two is the zero vector zero zero

181
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,110
i would like to show that some combination of those gives the zero vector what

182
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,040
shall i take

183
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,900
MTV one so i take

184
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,830
zero not taken all the ones but how many vetoes

185
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,900
so six OK

186
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,000
or five

187
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,470
and in other words what the point is if the zero vectors in there

188
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,530
if there is zero if if one of these vectors is the zero vector

189
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,230
independence is that

190
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,840
right if one of those vectors is the zero vector then i can always take

191
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,480
they include that one and none of the others and i would get the zero

192
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,440
answer and i would show

193
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,370
dependence OK

194
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,160
let me let me finally draw example

195
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,090
where they will be independent suppose that v one

196
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,990
and that the two

197
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,070
those are surely independent right

198
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,990
any combination of v one and v two

199
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,020
o will not be zero except the

200
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,660
zero combinations of those would be independent but now let me let me stick and

201
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,380
the third vector v three

202
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,620
independent or dependent now those three vectors so now and three here

203
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,110
i mean two-dimensional space

204
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,380
whatever i mean the plane

205
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,570
i have three vectors

206
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,030
that i didn't draw so carefully i didn't even tell you what exactly they were

207
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,950
but what's this answer on dependent or independent

208
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,450
deep and why

209
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,860
how do i know that those are dependent

210
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,750
how do i know that some combination of the one v two and v three

211
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,480
he was the magnet

212
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:03,810
this is the north pole of the magnet

213
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,830
this is the south pole

214
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,010
i don't remember it's written by frank you

215
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,230
so the magnetic field around like so

216
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,180
and i have here

217
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,300
current y y and ones the current through it

218
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,110
why is perpendicular to the blackboard

219
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,390
when i turn the current on if the current is coming out of the blackboard

220
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,380
five fifty percent chance because i really don't remember whether this is north out

221
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,740
but let's assume that this is the configuration

222
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,290
the current is coming out of the blackberry

223
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,500
you will see

224
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,670
this wire

225
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,260
experience force

226
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,860
this is an experimental fact

227
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,220
the force

228
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,910
on the wire

229
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,390
is always

230
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,780
in that direction

231
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,330
of i

232
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,980
crosby is a unit vectors

233
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,890
and since i was coming out of the blackboard

234
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,060
if i cross i would be

235
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,060
i get the force in this area

236
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,880
so if i reversed now to current

237
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,110
the current

238
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,900
goes like this

239
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,520
then of course the y i want to go down so you both

240
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,870
but i don't know which one will come first

241
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,340
because i didn't like the poles

242
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,330
so you see it now

243
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,360
slightly different from the way i on it

244
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,000
i draw magnet looking this way

245
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,630
it is of course much nicer for you to see this picture so you see

246
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,810
the wire

247
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,780
and there's the magnet

248
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,590
and now

249
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,580
i'm going to run a few hundred and wire

250
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,460
and then

251
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,000
you will jump up

252
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,470
or it will go down and they have a reverse current

253
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,870
and the opposite thing will happen

254
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,630
we're ready for this

255
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,260
three two one zero

256
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,950
notice there was this thing for that

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,470
the forcible so high

258
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,980
and even paul van

259
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,680
this supports

260
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,450
so now i can predict

261
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,480
the very first occurrence

262
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,990
in this experiment

263
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,910
that now

264
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,980
the wire will jump up

265
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,650
there we go i know not exactly because i switch

266
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,850
this way so now switch to this way

267
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,620
the wire jump up

268
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,870
that's the first row you three two one zero

269
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,120
very clear

270
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,150
so it come out

271
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,130
take this down

272
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:47,550
if i had

273
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,950
so it's ironic current

274
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,380
let's say i run the current i one

275
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,870
the wire

276
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,590
it will produce a magnetic field

277
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,700
right hand corkscrew

278
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,020
right here

279
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,640
the magnetic fields

280
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,490
will be

281
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,730
in the blackboards

282
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,880
call it the one

283
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,400
right here will be on the blackboard

284
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,050
but that's irrelevant right now

285
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,550
is out of the back record years in the record

286
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,250
i have another wire

287
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,450
when you're on the current i two

288
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,080
there will be enforced now

289
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,530
on this wire

290
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,480
in the direction i crosby

291
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,880
thank you and i cross

292
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,970
that forces up

293
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,970
this wire

294
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,480
will experience a force up

295
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
but of course

296
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,210
this why experience force up

297
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,390
this is actually my reaction

298
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,880
this is why will experience a force that

299
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,800
so there you go towards each other

300
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,760
they will be attracted by show

301
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,500
you can independently confirmed

302
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,420
that the force here is down

303
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,800
this is the force

304
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:08,400
probably will be enough to say actually was minus reaction

305
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,630
the third law

306
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,730
but if you want to put here

307
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,600
the magnetic field

308
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,130
which is the result of this current

309
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:21,990
which is of course out of the blackboard and the the right hand corkscrew rule

310
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,040
and now i put into dollars will then i can pay and are now left

311
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,060
in the same situation

312
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,540
and it's the case that the bank balance never goes negative

313
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,820
that's really important invariant to

314
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:53,940
so therefore the sum of the true cost or the amortized cost upper bounded sum

315
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,230
of the true cross

316
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,850
this is the sum of the

317
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,010
emma tries cost here is

318
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,960
i go i would want

319
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,360
this is

320
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,060
three and

321
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:15,630
so the point is this i've now bounded

322
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,930
the sum of the true costs by three m

323
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,200
let's go back to the stable here and we'll to see what happens

324
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:34,620
if i put in

325
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,660
c so i had

326
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,490
and the bank balance

327
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,100
so in fact

328
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,780
so the first thing i do is it is inserted

329
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,540
i charge three dollars

330
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,160
and i do an insert

331
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:06,160
how much drier rough

332
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,560
two dollars

333
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,010
turns out matching the charges two dollars and have only one dollar left

334
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:19,160
so this is i'm actually going under charge the first guy

335
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,080
because if i charge if i only show you that works if i

336
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,370
charge everybody three dollars except for sky charge to

337
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,700
actually save a little bit of one

338
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:34,140
OK then

339
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,310
this guy in charge three dollars

340
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,410
i've got it

341
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,970
what's the size of my

342
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:50,220
of my bank balance from down like copy one guy is all paid for foresight

343
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,560
two dollars left

344
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,620
with me

345
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,240
next kaieteur three dollars actually returned all these guys dollars

346
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,580
so here now

347
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,020
basically get two

348
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,260
i've got a table size before so i basically

349
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,450
i have

350
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,620
to copy of one insert the third guy i'm going copy two guys i will

351
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,260
use up that's all have only two dollars left in the table after the concert

352
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,310
now i search for sky

353
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,520
OK and that's a good one because now i built up above

354
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,120
balance here four dollars

355
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:43,430
because in have to copy and by

356
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,310
now i said this guy i'm going to copy for items so that expands that

357
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,160
OK i charge three and then to left

358
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,740
here basically have two to it

359
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,290
two to it

360
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,290
two to it

361
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,430
OK and at this point i use all up

362
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,200
go back to two

363
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,660
what centre

364
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,660
you see one of the things i want you to notice is i could have

365
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,260
charge three here

366
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:29,600
and i would add an extra dollar lying around throughout here what matters

367
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,620
still would be upper bounded by three n

368
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,200
so the idea is that different schemes for

369
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,060
charging advertised costs can work

370
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,290
and all have to be the same

371
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:48,240
it's not like when you dramatize analysis that there's one scheme that will work

372
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,290
i could charge four dollars

373
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,830
it would work

374
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,200
but it turns out i couldn't charge two dollars for everybody

375
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,240
factors two dollars for everybody at my balance would go negative

376
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,760
balance would go negative

377
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,060
can charge three dollars now work

378
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,100
four five six like the charge that the bound i would get would be simply

379
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,390
looser bound instead of it being less or equal to three and

380
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,350
the lesson call four and five or what have you

381
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,200
but if i tried to do too and it wouldn't work

382
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,700
because i wouldn't have enough money left

383
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,310
to copy of what would happen is i would have only one dollar

384
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,390
in this and then when it came time table bubble

385
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,320
you know that if this were data from a physical system this would mean that

386
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,160
you found love to understand the behavior of physical systems so

387
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,250
the most obvious thing is to say well there's a mathematical equation going through the

388
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,950
however like his points right away

389
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,870
there's always a mathematical equation going to any finite set of points

390
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,140
that's obviously

391
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,430
the case especially colliding whose

392
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,790
wonderful mathematician the simplest proof is probably what is now called the plastic interpolation which

393
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,440
actually was afterwards but

394
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:10,190
things like this invented the calculus we can assume that it was obvious to me

395
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,970
you can do you can put an equation for any finite set of points

396
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,780
so says like it's the existence of an equation going through a set of points

397
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:22,780
does not enable you to distinguish points that come from scattering in random on a

398
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,380
piece of paper or points that are measuring the physical system which obeys

399
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,980
physical laws so

400
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:32,260
what unable to distinguish well he says if the equation is sampling

401
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,800
that's a lot but if it's for compose a

402
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,810
then you can always find such an equation and its meaning

403
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,970
so this is the inside of

404
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,970
well that's another problem

405
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:51,990
that's another problem this is the criterion which is theoretical but it doesn't mean that

406
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,210
you could actually enables you to apply in each case and say to these points

407
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:01,090
following along to actually see what the what the simplest equation is passing through a

408
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,360
set of points are well if you limit yourself in algebraic equation may be used

409
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:18,040
OK in my case this model the expected the data is given

410
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,740
you know and you just trying to understand and that predict so make trying to

411
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,000
make it more closed but you

412
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,510
so yeah there are all kinds of epistemological problems this is just a question of

413
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,070
understand what it means to say there's a lot of it doesn't mean we can

414
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,690
determine if the law

415
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,470
OK so so

416
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,030
so so so

417
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,640
so this idea is mentioned by line its environment also says the world is comprehensible

418
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,740
that's in paragraph five you have to remember like sixteen eighty six is the year

419
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,100
before newton's principia

420
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,180
you know modern science is just beginning it was called mechanical philosophy and and all

421
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,840
of the medieval ideas and religion were still very much alive modern science and i

422
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,110
get obliterated all opposition

423
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,870
you know newton himself was half more in the past and the future was volterra

424
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,380
created with whom we consider to be used in the modern

425
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:09,310
scientists newton was not modern thinker he was more like about law sorcerer you know

426
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,840
and believed in theology so alive it's at this crucial moment in time when the

427
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,650
old school of thought is colliding with these new mechanical philosophy says well why is

428
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,370
the world comprehensible lullaby it's always try to keep everything good

429
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:26,670
you know he wanted protestantism and catholicism to be reunited he wanted to be able

430
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,090
to combine theology with modern science and not give up either

431
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:35,060
you know so so that he discusses in the score

432
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,970
how can you tell the science applies to the world the world is governed by

433
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,220
science and why

434
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,110
and the reason he says why is because of god i mean god creates the

435
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,100
world which on the one hand is very rich and diverse phenomenon

436
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,590
but on the other hand all this follows from very simple laws

437
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,570
so he's declaring that

438
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:58,550
the world is comprehensible is really the world is beautiful because it follows simple laws

439
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,190
of all the richness we see so this is like a postulate saying that science

440
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,310
is possible the world is comprehensible

441
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,340
so this is which which

442
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,060
alignments of proof of of

443
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,620
since we're jerusalem i can say it is the proof of of

444
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:17,580
the greatness of god that is that this beautiful world is made from a small

445
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,920
number of powerful brakes we say are powerful ideas

446
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,420
it's it's OK

447
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,070
so so this is why it's in sixteen eighty six now mobile takes this up

448
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:32,210
in his two books the open world nineteen thirty two and the philosophy of mathematics

449
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,820
one of the

450
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:43,160
so long

451
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:48,080
the more that is from

452
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,320
one of the from

453
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,110
every man

454
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,790
the name

455
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:37,980
and all

456
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,150
and are

457
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:56,530
one of graph

458
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:16,900
well known for example should be

459
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:27,060
we're not

460
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,480
i the think

461
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,660
lot of

462
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,320
these are all

463
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:09,210
by default

464
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:33,800
the first is

465
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,180
all right

466
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,070
one of

467
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,900
or i should

468
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,770
how we

469
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:33,580
so long

470
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:43,010
one one

471
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,590
and it follows

472
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,580
that means that

473
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,620
because of the

474
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:44,840
the problem

475
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:49,010
why we can

476
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,600
for a all

477
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,010
one of the

478
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:08,930
ontology there

479
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:26,650
on top of

480
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:32,770
i think that we can develop some sense of the evidence for above or some

481
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:37,980
degree of predictability set and not the mystic predictability

482
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
that is is we can do much better

483
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,460
then the fed has told us we could do in the system so i'll stop

484
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:51,290
you and i apologize for thinking it thank you

485
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,810
thank you

486
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:57,380
we decided

487
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,570
for me

488
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:43,560
they may of

489
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:39,500
problem one

490
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:57,960
you will

491
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,360
all right

492
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:33,360
and there were

493
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,410
this is

494
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:58,700
let me respond to that

495
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,170
i see that not just in social sciences

496
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,140
you a good example in matter engineering

497
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,490
the issues

498
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,450
prediction the assessment of the lifetime of the structure is the major power in the

499
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:18,270
US where all bridges are getting and so anyone

500
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:23,240
everywhere you want to the plane can fly safely and so i want to

501
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,160
predict when they are going to fail

502
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,640
what is the start of the process mechanical engineering

503
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,570
i really summarizes approached by looking at the tree in the forest where they do

504
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,610
they they do very dedicated as expert

505
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,330
assesment non-district non-destructive testing

506
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,230
to look at

507
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:39,910
you know

508
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,770
where are the micro cracks

509
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,490
how the acoustic emission how the measurement of the kids

510
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,030
it is here and there and they have these exactly describe these global markets me

511
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:54,040
detailed information the big problem is that in order to make a prediction

512
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,070
you need not only to analyse not only to gather data on how this huge

513
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,520
unitary aggregates information

514
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:07,020
indeed the information of the global collapse

515
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:13,150
is not was so weakly encoded in the indian elements you need to reconstruct

516
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,240
actually i was lucky to work at the time that was actually the beginning of

517
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,980
one entity of the crashes as a precursor

518
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,820
eight years before that

519
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,320
actually i developed with the major european companies

520
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,950
a system that now is the industry faced to predict the structure in all the

521
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,150
things that fly

522
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:38,110
europe satellites and rockets

523
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:43,570
two basically do this program of aggregating the information about them

524
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,820
through what physicists call there

525
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:49,740
course going approach or renormalisation group approach

526
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,120
something that actually

527
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,990
he's out progressively the noise

528
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,440
to extract the information the main point is that

529
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:03,160
i think there is a misconception in many sciences many endeavors or in policy-making

530
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,230
that by

531
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,620
again a very simple-minded approach but it seemed to work

532
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,620
much better than just using the words two

533
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:15,800
there is no again as data miners we can actually think of our more fancy

534
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,260
models are a bit more topical kind of models using latent dirichlet allocation and they

535
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,600
come up with some measure

536
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:26,360
maybe based on hellinger distance is not a better job but again but this is

537
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,560
the main idea is kind of captured in this

538
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,170
slide here

539
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:39,280
so again another for drawback using word matches of words so they the what matters

540
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,180
work well if you are matching on frequent words what about rare words right then

541
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,300
rare words

542
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:50,360
so if you look at the top if you look at the distribution of words

543
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,450
there is

544
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:56,640
he was long tail distribution that eighty percent of the occurrences are conquered by twenty

545
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,690
percent of the world's but then the remaining is all spread out across a lot

546
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,030
of different so

547
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:06,250
so how do we tackle this problem so one one way is to start building

548
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,380
aggregation on the tail and had phrases instead of using words

549
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:15,870
they were again the other problem with the information retrieval approaches static so in a

550
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,940
given the content

551
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:23,010
it just give you semantic score now does not take into account external factors that

552
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,730
might affect relevance of for instance there might be

553
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,300
the your interest in basketball players might

554
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:34,140
really increase the large because there was there was recently there is a game

555
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:38,950
held at the giants stadium for instance right and that's not captured by semantic

556
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:43,050
that's not captured by in information retrieval based matching approach and this is something external

557
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,680
that happens that has to be able to take that into account so this is

558
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,470
something that you miss if you just do information retrieval approach so click feedback using

559
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:55,180
click feedback is a powerful way of capturing such latent

560
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,750
effects that might happen over time

561
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,290
you know

562
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:05,860
this is definitely a very difficult to do it through relevance so that the problem

563
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,480
with the relevance score is it does not correspond to click-through rate let's remember

564
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,170
if you recall the revenue model

565
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:18,240
in used to CTR times bid to rank now if you use

566
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,840
relevance as a proxy for click-through rate

567
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:27,970
that's really not mac optimizing the click-through rates the long it optimizing something about relevance

568
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,890
is not equivalent to probability although

569
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:33,670
you can normalize both these things on the same scale from zero to one relevance

570
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,250
o point two doesn't mean the probability it doesn't mean correspond to probability of point

571
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:42,120
right so then you have to come up with some other ways of translating this

572
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:48,480
into something that would translate of optimizing expected revenue so that's another problem maybe it's

573
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,850
a better idea to estimate the click-through rates directly and use that as the normalisation

574
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,730
rather than using relevance school so

575
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,830
so again these are some of the other

576
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:05,470
the other thing is as many of these information retrieval approaches use something like a

577
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,580
single TF IDF school so the idea of of war

578
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,490
is again

579
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:13,620
uniform across the entire corpus of that's not really true if you look at content

580
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:19,630
there could be so many different problem you have publishers alsop's as most publishers also

581
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,630
camera now

582
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,350
you know the idea for valor

583
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,200
cannot be uniform across the entire corpus it really depends on the context and you

584
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,350
know captaining that is there is no good way of capturing that these four now

585
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:36,610
in the information retrieval literature so these are again some of the drawbacks of the

586
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,480
information retrieval approach

587
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:43,990
many of the information retrieval approach based on the notion of getting feedback

588
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,980
so you will give some query documents two

589
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,200
humans and they tell you it's relevant and not use that as your training data

590
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,150
to come up with the model

591
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,470
now that's not very scalable in the case of online advertising is not scalable we

592
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:02,980
really want a system that is scalable automated and generates revenue using low marginal cost

593
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,770
that's the first slide that the most leading to so

594
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:12,260
so that's another reason why using click feedback could be more advantageous because you get

595
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,660
a lot of feedback

596
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,360
the other thing again

597
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,360
and then again not all text rights so if good landing page you might have

598
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,740
video image

599
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:25,360
and all sorts of things so how do you how do you get relevance when

600
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,250
you have

601
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:30,010
a bunch of things on the given date right if here video and text how

602
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,090
use the information retrieval

603
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,240
not very clear right so that's that's another

604
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,970
problem so

605
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,530
no one to kind of

606
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:44,160
we get all the effects which we had in the previous slide is too large

607
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,080
this too

608
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,520
use machine learning approach that can learn from click feedback

609
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,620
obtained from the system

610
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:57,840
and again a few using that so so there have been several papers that have

611
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,290
been a lot of work in this area by the other areas not seen a

612
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:05,450
lot of work but this area has seen a lot of work so

613
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:11,390
for instance so there have been several papers that have explored feature based models to

614
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,270
estimate click-through rate so what the feature this model so

615
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:20,600
you characterise every query by a bunch of features you characterise every have a bunch

616
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,720
of features

617
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,860
the could not because your response variable and you try to build a machine learning

618
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,660
that can mean

619
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:30,520
take these features and predict the three

620
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:32,920
so those are really feature this model

621
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:38,100
people have also been working on hierarchical models or the hierarchical models do is basically

622
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:43,070
try to get a better estimate of click-through rate by borrowing information from multiple resolutions

623
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,690
so if you start working with models at very fine resolution

624
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,340
there is the

625
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:51,590
extreme data sparsity and

626
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:56,510
it becomes difficult to reliably estimate parameters that resolution so you might want to make

627
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,660
the estimates more reliable by falling back at coarser resolution there is a lot of

628
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,240
data and improving estimates finer resolution so there have been some work in that matrix

629
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,610
factorisation and collaborative filtering techniques that have been investigated quite a bit now in the

630
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,370
context of netflix

631
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,880
and the movie recommendation problem and now kind of also being starting to use in

632
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,240
this area

633
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:22,960
and then there are several challenges and open problems which i'm going to describe and

634
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,270
finally you know

635
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,320
and with the online learning so

636
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,200
right so

637
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,620
so so we've already so this is the estimation problem which are trying to solve

638
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:37,590
so given a query given that and given the user what is the probability of

639
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:41,120
the user clicking on the right this is what we really want estimate that's going

640
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,280
to be of interest

641
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,990
so this is this is a difficult problem

642
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,440
there are several reasons why this is a difficult problem for stuff on

643
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:59,410
the labels which we get click or no click are noisy so not all cliques

644
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,790
reflect the intent of the user

645
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:05,230
not i don't think so reflective of the fact that the user really like that

646
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,590
there are many unscrupulous users trying to game the system so you might have heard

647
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:12,120
things like click fraud no

648
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:14,290
click fraud is solely done

649
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:19,380
generate revenue do using unfair means that the user has no

650
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,400
the intent of actually clicking on that and looking at it so

651
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:24,780
that kind of

652
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:28,320
but you'd see our data when you're trying to learn click rates

653
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,850
secondly the it's not it's not clear what is the negative in in this case

654
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:37,070
so there is a user who never clicks on that

655
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:41,080
if there is a user never edits some and then

656
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,290
no matter what you show him his your she's not going to click on that

657
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:47,890
doesn't mean that he that is not relevant to the query the ultimate goal is

658
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:52,180
there are actually either this only nine or ten different interpretations of PCA this is

659
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:57,060
this is another one point of a way to right PCA in you get to

660
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:01,370
play some of you get to play playoffs PC ideas morning

661
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,470
what i want to do next is

662
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,540
what i want to do next is on

663
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,100
all about a few

664
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:40,910
castaways was PCA is used one is visualizations right on

665
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:45,120
very often you have high dimensional data sets and someone gives you a fifty dimensional

666
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,010
is set

667
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,100
and it is very hard to

668
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,240
for used to look at the data set the three-dimensional and understand what's going on

669
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,620
to become part something fifty dimensions

670
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,040
on so

671
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:58,910
common practice if you want to visualize very high dimensional data set is to take

672
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:03,640
your data and projected into say to d part of project into three parts you

673
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:10,120
can render like display computer on so you can better visualize the data structure

674
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:15,140
what physical example that that the roundabout of doing this we see it was enough

675
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:19,260
precision noise last appearance stand in which he

676
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:25,320
he had readings from fifty different parts of the monkey brain i have the there

677
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,350
is number fifty percent tens

678
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:31,240
of parts different possible among iranian so you have this

679
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,640
fifty dimensional readings of fifty dimensional vectors correspond to

680
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,520
different amounts of electrical activity in different parts among people is actually fifty neurons tens

681
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,470
of neurons

682
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,100
but also tens of neurons in the brain and see if a fifty dimensional time

683
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:50,760
series on and very hard to visualize very high dimensional data

684
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,600
but what you instances it was his PCA to project this fifty dimensional data down

685
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,040
to three dimensions

686
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:01,490
and then you can visualize this data in three dimensions is using every part and

687
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:06,470
say yes visualize what the money is thinking over time the the school

688
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:14,430
another common application of ICA is compression

689
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:18,830
if you have high dimensional data you want to for it with the overall number

690
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:21,890
PC is a great way to do this on

691
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:24,810
it turns out also that all

692
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:30,430
sometimes in machine learning sometimes you just give an extremely high dimensional input data

693
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:35,580
for computational reasons you don't want to deal with such high dimensional computational data such

694
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:41,520
high dimensional data and so on

695
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:45,890
fairly one one common user PC is taking a very high dimensional data

696
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:51,020
and represented here with a low dimensional subspace why is the representation of time just

697
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:56,720
so you can work with much lower dimensional data and on it turns out he

698
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:01,640
son to see if fact of life that we given an extremely high dimensional data

699
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,830
on almost all the time just in practice paul hi hi very high dimensional this

700
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:09,870
is i've ever seen high very high dimensional this is often

701
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:13,680
have all the points lying on much lower dimensional subspaces

702
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:18,060
so very often you can dramatically reduce the dimension of the data and really not

703
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,580
and really not before in too much too much of the information away

704
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:30,850
let's see right so learning algorithm to take a long time to run being on

705
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:35,600
on very high dimensional data often use PCA to compress the data to low dimensions

706
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,660
of your learning algorithm runs much faster and you can often do this with your

707
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:43,560
sacrificing almost no performance problems

708
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,520
this one of the use of PC for learning of which is

709
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:52,830
you remember we talk about learning theory we said that

710
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,930
the more features you have the more

711
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:59,870
complex hypothesis costs exceeding the classification right if you have more features you have lots

712
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:00,990
of features

713
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,200
then you may be more prone to overfitting

714
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,990
so one other thing could do with PCA is used that to reduce the dimension

715
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:08,080
of the data

716
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,870
so that you have fewer features and you may be slightly less prone to overfitting

717
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,140
this particular application PCA to learning i should say you know it sometimes works often

718
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,680
world so i actually to show couple of examples we salute this in works on

719
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,870
but this book application PCA i find a way looking industry it also seems to

720
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,310
the over use of and and in particular

721
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:36,290
markov model tells you about the probability of tran making a transition from state to

722
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:39,950
to state three which is just you know a particular epoch through the word if

723
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:43,220
you like and so here is that the top row here is that market model

724
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,660
just the first order markov chain like before but now

725
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,290
the whole point is to excite that model

726
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:55,180
from observations and so the way you

727
00:50:55,230 --> 00:51:00,310
two a graphical model of that is used sort of backwards you explain the data

728
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:05,140
conditioned on this your belief about what the word model is you say well if

729
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:09,950
i simulated in a particular way drawing from the conditional probabilities at each time step

730
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:13,720
each of these yellow blob from left to right is the time step and so

731
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,450
that i have you know state once they once they were on the stage two

732
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:21,040
stage two stage two and then in this direction you have to have a narrow

733
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,750
which says well given state to what is unlikely fragment of spectrum you know his

734
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:32,290
the his the signal going to get to summarise this signal as the sequence of

735
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:38,290
little slices on each slice your describe the signal spectrum doesn't matter if you don't

736
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:42,100
know what spectra signal spectrum means but i think the point is it's just some

737
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,310
features of the of the signal so we going to predict what

738
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:51,020
a set of features of this the signal likely to occur conditioned on a particular

739
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:55,430
this is the kind of thing that they do in with markov models in in

740
00:51:55,430 --> 00:52:02,080
speech and then this is a hidden markov model because the markov chain now

741
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,080
and refers to some

742
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:09,430
variables that you can't actually observed directly things you observe directly are only indirectly related

743
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:12,450
to the variables in the markov chain he must have an awful lot of this

744
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,000
even says yes

745
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,790
you agree you have an awful lot of this kind of thing

746
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:24,370
and you know we can even use this kind of thing directly in vision but

747
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:27,390
in a very different way than what i'm going to talk about the just you

748
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:34,750
know have interest we can make a motion trackers rather like belief tracking that i

749
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:38,580
showed before and also rather like not that will

750
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,310
this is a sort of primitive form that's how how we would have not tell

751
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:46,290
ten years ago with the kind of this is the clanking suit of armour here

752
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:49,310
is the kind of underlying model but all

753
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:54,000
all done as random variables so the angles of all the joint random variables and

754
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,310
the angle of the joint at time t condition on time t minus one is

755
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:01,370
another probability distribution and so on and

756
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:05,270
here's another of the same kinds of things and just you know by building one

757
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,580
of these models

758
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:11,370
the model itself is learned from a lot of data in this case but hand

759
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:17,870
constructed in this case you can make something which will make inferences from

760
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:23,580
as a temporal sequence of image frames now this sequence of yellow blob each one

761
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,870
is an image frame time t t plus twenty plus two and so on and

762
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:32,750
these blobs here the underlying markov chain are you know that have joint angles at

763
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,620
time t effective joint angles at time t plus one so so you know we

764
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:40,290
can do good things with those hidden markov models in vision

765
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:44,720
but what we're going to talk about now for the rest of the time is

766
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,500
a very different kind of markov model getting back to the array of pixels and

767
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,890
how we would like to link decisions in this array of pixels now

768
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:57,270
if i make a graph

769
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:58,270
out of

770
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:04,410
even the simplest linkage of pixels then you know his the simplest graph that you

771
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:10,000
can imagine it's it's not too simple to be useful where i simply link horizontally

772
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,660
and vertically adjacent pixels on the chessboard

773
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,750
and but this graph is already problematic to the point of view of inference because

774
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:21,500
it has many cycles and you know from

775
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,120
the weak selection is the doing inference in graphs that free of cycles that are

776
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:31,310
actually trees is very much more tractable everything in such a tree

777
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:34,720
can be done exactly all the inference can be done exactly and if you have

778
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:39,450
a hidden markov model in which the hidden part is one of these trees and

779
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,700
there's a linkage from each node in the tree

780
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,680
to some observable

781
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:48,270
then you know the the inference can be done exactly under all kinds of circumstances

782
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:52,470
in that kind of structure and before i cannot abandon that idea of you know

783
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:57,560
abandon hope of having a tree to explain what they think it is in the

784
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,230
image i do i would like to point out that some people have done this

785
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:06,640
successfully but it's very hard to do it in a way that is completely general

786
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:11,200
overall images in other words it's quite hard to think of the tree

787
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,820
which is you know the tree is going to be the graph that i would

788
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,770
have liked to the whole of linkage is removed to make it back into tree

789
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:21,250
very hard to decide which linkages to remove completely general way which will work for

790
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:26,450
all images but what you can do much more effectively is for a particular

791
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:33,270
a particular image construct a particular tree where a set of edges has been removed

792
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,910
that works well just for that data set and this is what effects this paper

793
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:42,680
in two thousand five dollars in rather clever way and so she what she does

794
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,930
this she sold for a minimum spanning tree with respect to some particular set of

795
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,950
edge weights that are related to the the details the data what going to go

796
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:54,200
into it but it's a beautiful idea and you know i think a lot more

797
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,870
will be made that but OK now i'm having just you know after that final

798
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:03,290
hopeful message i'm going to descend into the abyss of

799
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:10,000
of fully connected graphs not fully connected but of graphs with cycles in them where

800
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,540
every every neighbour in this horizontal vertical sense is connected up

801
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:23,580
so what this means in graphical model terms if you got undirected graphical models model

802
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,430
is that when we tried to work out

803
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,580
conditional independence

804
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,950
of this guy

805
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,850
all of the rest of the nodes in the graph in fact that conditional dependence

806
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,520
is limited to the dependence on the immediate neighbours

807
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:43,890
so you might think well that sounds like a rather impoverished model because what that

808
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:47,040
means is that when you make a decision about this guy is only going to

809
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,660
take into account its immediate neighbours but that would be totally wrong

810
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,370
conclusion to draw in just the same way that with the weather the you know

811
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:59,060
the text example of the whether the direct link is only from one day to

812
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,910
the previous day that doesn't mean that the beginning of the week

813
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:06,490
it doesn't affect the inferences you make about the end of the week because of

814
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:11,040
the knock-on effects from one day to the next to the next it just means

815
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,000
that the

816
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:18,580
it the functional form if you like about non knock-on effect is constrained in such

817
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:22,620
a way that it can be expressed in this very efficient way in the case

818
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,100
of the

819
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:29,310
of the weather model by conditional probabilities that only bother to link adjacent days and

820
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:35,220
in the case of this pixel array model by functions we'll see

821
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:39,790
shortly functions which only connect

822
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:47,200
adjacent pixels but you know i conclusion that that it is often wrongly drawn is

823
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:52,350
but this was not used

824
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:12,660
i think

825
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:16,720
if you want to be a

826
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,160
what's wrong

827
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,810
right now there is only one work

828
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:30,200
what you want

829
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:52,980
so i think

830
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:04,290
again you

831
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:08,060
all right

832
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:34,370
it is

833
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:48,370
now i want

834
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:38,930
you were the one

835
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:45,230
so this

836
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:50,080
you be

837
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:55,540
or the

838
01:00:55,730 --> 01:01:00,640
all right we already

839
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,360
it is the only difference in the sense that the maximum likelihood estimation

840
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,230
is that when choosing

841
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,890
you know the math is that using them as like value of data

842
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:14,200
yes that maximizing this which which had like nation

843
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:17,310
and in times is the quantity which is the prior

844
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:23,850
let's see

845
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:27,500
one intuition is that if your prior

846
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:30,900
it's called

847
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:38,850
data being gaussians with mean zero some covariance

848
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,510
then for distribution like this most of the probability mass is close to zero rates

849
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:51,000
of the gaussians centered around the point zero and so was probably master causes

850
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:55,430
and so the prior distribution is saying that you think most of the parameters should

851
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:57,700
be close to zero

852
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:02,340
on and if you remember our discussion on feature selection if you eliminate the feature

853
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:03,870
from consideration

854
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,000
that's the same as

855
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,300
setting this is the value of theta

856
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:13,580
it is that theta five to be zero that's the same as

857
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:17,480
eliminating feature five hypotheses

858
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:22,720
and so this is the higher the drives most of the parameter values to zero

859
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:27,590
two values close to zero you think of this as doing something analogous to do

860
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,490
something reminiscent of feature selection

861
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:35,250
it turns out that what this formulation parameters one one one actually be exactly zero

862
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,930
but many of the values because

863
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,080
and so

864
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:42,880
i guess in pictures

865
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:53,110
if you remember i said that if you have say five data points for the

866
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,910
four for the polynomial

867
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:03,620
well i think that too many problems and

868
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,000
if you find any for the forefather if the very high polynomial to very small

869
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,220
dataset you can get these very large oscillations

870
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:13,660
if you use mozilla like estimation

871
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:18,160
in contrast if you apply this the bayesian regularization

872
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:21,240
you can actually fit the high order polynomial

873
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,600
but still get

874
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,310
so events move to the data

875
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:31,790
the kristol says he kristol driving the transistor because because zero

876
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,810
and that in practice so hard to see the article

877
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:40,760
that's how small is smaller on the cross tend to the your data also becomes

878
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,580
friends with the same ten

879
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:47,120
less and less overfit even even when you fitting a large number of parameters

880
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:54,170
but c

881
01:03:55,350 --> 01:04:02,930
one last piece of intuition that just toss out there you get to fail more

882
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:07,160
this particular set of ideas more in on problems at three which of course online

883
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:09,370
this week yes

884
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:14,450
is that whereas that's likely who tries minimize

885
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:30,130
right rest mass likelihood first a linear regression turns out to be missing this

886
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:34,100
it turns out that if you look at this higher turn there

887
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:39,490
it turns out that the optimisation objective you to optimize

888
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:43,750
turns out to be that way you add an extra term that you know

889
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,250
penalizes you transition state has being like

890
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:51,430
this ends up being an and is very similar to most likely that except that

891
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,960
you tend to keep the parameters small

892
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:55,750
and this has the effect

893
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,280
discrimination of death

894
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:01,590
shape northfield and so on just but the culverts horizontal

895
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,540
it is also there were about six in essen and doing

896
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:08,310
in which gained given the picture they also try to recover the three d structure

897
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:12,210
of the image so that's also very interesting piece of work in this case they

898
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:17,340
have more the representation is not so simple they try to recover the may be

899
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,200
more complicated

900
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:23,970
and they also try to get absolute depth so it's not just to say that

901
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:27,950
something has a particular shape but that some of particle at this time so have

902
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:30,950
calibrated information

903
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,240
and the idea is that once you have this kind of information you can also

904
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,290
include that in order to build better detection

905
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:41,490
so imagine that you have an image and you have been able to defy what

906
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:45,920
the support surfaces with are the vertical surfaces what is the sky and so on

907
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:47,920
now you can use this information

908
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:49,530
to incorporate

909
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:52,930
to go to incorporate the town of detectors let's say they scientific

910
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:56,360
because cars you could have a feature that

911
01:05:56,390 --> 01:06:00,140
thanks to decide if something in the past in which you are able to cite

912
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:04,470
another kind pressing corresponds to an object surface like a vertical surface and the part

913
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,800
below corresponds to an artist on the surface

914
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,900
that could be an important feature that you could use in order to improve current

915
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:13,820
so here are some examples of

916
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:18,650
thing to the cars and now is integrating also this additional features test to check

917
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:22,120
if the part below the tower exactly ground

918
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:25,920
is the ground surface so in this case this may look like a car but

919
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,720
the part below is a vertical surface you can

920
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,360
i assume that this is a false alarm

921
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:38,290
the use of that information can also be incorporated by having more qualitative representation in

922
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:43,040
state of trying to get an accurate representation you can also reason about just what

923
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:47,580
are the qualitative relationship between different surfaces like the fact that the car is on

924
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:50,050
the road you need to have a very

925
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:54,590
state representation of what is the three d shape of the car or road one

926
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:59,670
capture these qualitative relationship that the car is on top of the road and that

927
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:04,500
the fact so given a bunch of text is if you encode these qualitative three

928
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:08,850
relationships well you can more or less get some of these labels right so the

929
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:12,430
sand was detected here but you know that the sun is not supposed to be

930
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:14,740
on top of the waves is supposed to be above

931
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:18,630
so this should be the right protection for the sand and this away from the

932
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:21,390
there are some but it's here

933
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:26,170
so you can clean to infections by incorporating this qualitative relationships

934
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:30,740
OK so that's for detection

935
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:33,460
in context with the

936
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:34,730
so now

937
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:38,000
i'm going to move to a different aspect

938
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,980
that has been now more and more attention the piece to incorporate

939
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,250
very large data bases in order to do this recognition task

940
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,180
so these are the families of the things that rely on the fact that you

941
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:52,930
have very very large databases available to two

942
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:56,400
we are trying to solve the same task finding talking about until now

943
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,140
one of the most important aspects when you're trying to do the recognition is the

944
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:04,550
data have for training and

945
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:08,940
and for many many years people were thinking that OK if you think about how

946
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:14,530
humans learn about this from knowledge of course humans have many different input modalities they

947
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:18,930
don't have don't give them as input label images now they go in the world

948
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:22,960
walk around and interact with the world so they get to know how can you

949
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,350
move obj is how they feel when detach them so they have a lot to

950
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:29,230
access to a lot of different data that is

951
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:33,720
take an unsupervised there's no people nobody given due labels

952
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:35,270
is active system

953
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:38,680
and of course you can have a teacher also going to some of the traditional

954
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:43,990
labels colour from many many different ways of many kinds of information

955
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:47,780
so people would think it OK we want to have the same kind of input

956
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:51,280
for computers well then we have to work with robots

957
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:55,310
the problem with what is that OK

958
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:59,400
is it seems like an interesting idea has many input modalities but nowadays they are

959
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:03,570
very poor and they are active but are they don't really go very far they

960
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:07,450
don't get out of the lab to not exist in a small office the problem

961
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:11,190
is that we would like to appear to have realised that look like this but

962
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:12,780
we have always the latest

963
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,490
so we're going nowhere with this

964
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:17,540
and certainly something you appear

965
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,110
that nobody was really

966
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:24,040
four seen at the beginning is the internet so the internet has given people the

967
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:28,320
computer vision researchers with any sort of information that this system is reach it also

968
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:32,370
has many different input modalities there are millions and billions of images out there

969
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:36,870
but you can use this input modalities that are different from input modalities that human

970
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:40,530
but still there may be more or less have the same kind of challenges you

971
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:42,640
have to put all this information together

972
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:46,190
you can also reach everywhere has very large

973
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:51,250
the very last fingers and toes of data probably even more data than the amount

974
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:54,950
of data that than fun has the first ten years of life so now you

975
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:59,340
have an amount of data that is equivalent to what people get to see is

976
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:02,900
different kind of data but the same sort of this some money to then also

977
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:07,220
conditions no more than what want formalise and so on

978
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:11,250
so people know how big using internet in order to build big databases and thus

979
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,100
have an important audition

980
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,820
and in principle that plays

981
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,670
two very interesting instance learning

982
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:23,510
this is joint work that i've done with the remnants and i'm here today and

983
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:29,750
her quite sir at the parallel computing lab at the university of california berkeley and

984
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:36,760
our work is on that support vector machine training and classification on graphics processors

985
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:39,150
so just to

986
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:43,850
over the outline for the sort of person going to motivate why anyone should be

987
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:49,400
interested in thinking about general-purpose computing on graphics processors and and what it means to

988
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,250
be compute the general computing community as a whole

989
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:57,900
that we're starting to see such massively parallel general purpose processors then i'm going to

990
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:03,790
talk about our support vector machine training implementation and unlike the

991
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:09,950
the two talk so we just heard were actually interested not in linear SVM but

992
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:11,970
in kernelized SVM

993
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,680
and we

994
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:18,830
implemented basically all go through the details of the algorithm that we implement including are

995
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:22,400
working set selection heuristic and then also

996
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:28,450
talk briefly about support vector machine classification graphics processors

997
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:33,090
so to motivate i think that to talk so we just heard have done a

998
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:39,290
good job of motivating why support vector machine training is expensive and and kernel based

999
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:41,230
support vector machine training is

1000
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:45,360
it is even more computationally intensive because of all these kernel evaluations that we have

1001
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,420
to do is make it hard to

1002
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:53,690
do the math very clever things that people have done for linear SVM training and

1003
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:57,470
we often have a lot more data than we can process so we're we're all

1004
01:11:57,470 --> 01:11:59,230
interested and scalability

1005
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:00,750
on the same

1006
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:04,690
on the other hand we're at the point now

1007
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,750
in computing where future

1008
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:10,390
performance increases are going to come primarily through parallelism

1009
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:15,720
so i don't know if you've noticed but over the past few years clock speed

1010
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:20,030
of normal processors has been increasing and the

1011
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:24,420
single for performance of of normal processors has been increasing but at a much slower

1012
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,140
rate than it has in the past

1013
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:30,600
so in order for us to think about scalability in the future and we're going

1014
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:35,510
to have to think about parallelism i really appreciated the previous sock they did a

1015
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:38,740
good job of paralyzing and and that

1016
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:43,510
i think that's the direction that were we're all headed so

1017
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:48,450
the difference is now though compared with in the past that we have the opportunity

1018
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:51,080
to exploit parallelism on a single chip

1019
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:53,140
and this changes a lot

1020
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,450
what things are possible

1021
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,700
and to paralyze because

1022
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:00,420
synchronization is much cheaper so

1023
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:06,450
to synchronize the cluster CPU is they all need to synchronize over ethernet are mere

1024
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:10,200
nanda or what have you it's much cheaper when

1025
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:12,360
all of the processors on a chip

1026
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:20,070
our synchronizing using on network or the external memory interface it it

1027
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:25,050
because synchronization is so much cheaper some things that were bottlenecks to parallelisation the past

1028
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:26,350
become tractable

1029
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:30,550
and that's that's what we see with our SVM training

1030
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:38,360
graphics processors out a lot of you may have heard of general-purpose computing on graphics

1031
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:43,480
processors in the past and people have done a lot of really interesting work in

1032
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:46,670
that but it's always been kind of strange like you have to think about all

1033
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:51,100
of your data in terms of four vector floats and you have to pack everything

1034
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:56,450
in terms of graphics textures and use open GL shatters and and so forth so

1035
01:13:56,450 --> 01:14:00,430
i'm i'm here to tell you today that that area is over graphics processors are

1036
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:06,770
general purpose you can program them using see the restrictions of the past are basically

1037
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:11,730
gone there are still a few works that are being worked out and then we

1038
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:13,480
run into some of them but

1039
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:18,740
we we didn't at all the implementation that we did here is applicable to general

1040
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:24,290
purpose parallel programming which in five years old the CPS from int'l are going to

1041
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:30,010
be highly parallel as well so that the techniques that we apply here are kind

1042
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:34,680
of in their we see them as being indicative of the future program

1043
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:38,970
so i i'm i have on this slide a picture of

1044
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:42,980
the di four invidious latest greatest graphics processors the

1045
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:46,190
the g-force GTX two eighty

1046
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:50,590
and you can see i don't know how many of you have to bypass before

1047
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:55,240
but usually on a dive what you see a big huge cash

1048
01:14:55,250 --> 01:15:00,570
the thing that looks like cash on this processor all all of these clusters right

1049
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:05,030
here right here those are actually the cause of the processor on the chip there

1050
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:07,190
are two hundred forty cause

1051
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:12,530
there are arranged into clusters and you can see ten clusters around around the edge

1052
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:15,810
and each of them has three

1053
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:20,310
clusters inside of it and each those clusters has eight processors same final at the

1054
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:24,810
two hundred forty cause and the big stuff in the middle which is

1055
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:30,240
the memory interface and synchronisation networks and so forth

1056
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:35,750
programming such as a parallel processor is is very different in the sense that

1057
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:40,780
we like massive parallelism and we're not afraid of launching a million threads at once

1058
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:44,190
so the hardware actually has context to support

1059
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:48,920
in the GTX two eighty up to thirty thousand friends that all can be sitting

1060
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,720
on the chip and all have their own context this is not swapping contacts on

1061
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:56,360
and off the shelf these are resident threads each have their own register file and

1062
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:00,940
so forth and so when you when you know on on a normal parallel processor

1063
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:05,020
today and say say an intel core two duo u you think about wanting to

1064
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:06,150
threads at the time

1065
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:10,870
here on a graphics processor we think about wanting a million president time and then

1066
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:15,920
the hardware takes care about crossing into groups as i said we can have multiple

1067
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,770
tens of thousands of threads running at the same time on the same

1068
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:24,520
so the GP is also have large

1069
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:29,130
peak throughput ratings lots of big memory subsystems

1070
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:33,870
it's interesting to point out that the register file is actually larger than the cache

1071
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:38,780
is by a considerable amount so register files becomes

1072
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,480
a really important places to put data

1073
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:46,780
and the amount of memory that the graphics card has to work with in the

1074
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:51,060
ones that we're using is about get by in video does so ones with larger

1075
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,070
memory cache capacity up to four bytes but we're not dealing with this

1076
01:16:56,270 --> 01:17:01,050
so just to mention briefly about how we program use

1077
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:04,230
programming is

1078
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:08,930
these GP's is done through cuda which is a small extension to c plus plus

1079
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:14,710
and basically the way it works is the programmer expresses computation in terms of serial

1080
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:19,380
which are called grains and each of those grades is composed of

1081
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,920
fred blocks

1082
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,940
and when you go to a particular i

1083
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:29,990
let's get this one you have got this is one bit one bit output fall

1084
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,790
between so let it slide here

1085
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:36,250
and then she with

1086
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:42,510
sixteen location because you from it about and and one so then what you do

1087
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:45,750
is you want to make this here

1088
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:50,610
you want to implement this is logic in the editor you will make

1089
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,530
too stable of this into which has

1090
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:55,520
and it would be if i knew what the

1091
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,210
because court the memory for each

1092
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:00,040
the value of the

1093
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,480
so you have

1094
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:06,280
you have sixteen bit memory which would be loaded with this but there

1095
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:11,050
and because you have loaded down at the end when you get this a b

1096
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:12,720
c d and this input you

1097
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:19,520
corresponding to it's quite quite simple extremely flexible because you can implement kind of twenty

1098
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,470
you can you can implement one gallon fuel

1099
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:25,590
if you have one of the major don't care to do that you have to

1100
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:28,840
duplicate the existing so it's it's three

1101
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:35,150
the connection between the film to legitimate

1102
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,750
the school is switch

1103
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:43,520
metric so you are very fast lock and connections of this one

1104
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:44,520
will be

1105
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:48,450
he could have done in in the fast way connected to this one now if

1106
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:51,020
you want to connect this one this one

1107
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,110
of this one this one you have to go with this

1108
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:59,120
switch matrix which which would introduce a me but again you have a lot of

1109
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:02,100
of capability also one

1110
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:08,840
the software we we know we manage that fall on

1111
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:10,200
how do you

1112
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:13,450
do you hold your your device so you have

1113
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:17,620
basically three types of a fifteen years

1114
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:19,270
one is

1115
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:24,160
it's just that the configurations so which means that the whole thing is

1116
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:29,350
the content of the media will be loaded in in static

1117
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:37,310
it means that when you pull off your device you lose your configurations so you

1118
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:39,710
have to be polynomial time

1119
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:44,300
but that's extremely flexible because also it means that you can

1120
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:48,860
on the fly change the functionality of your device you

1121
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:54,490
no flash over all other but almost so it's

1122
01:19:54,730 --> 01:20:01,280
it's it's a bit more difficult but still you can put on the article even

1123
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,890
even in second you don't have to think that you want to put it a

1124
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:09,990
special programme can be a key parameter in you know about and then you have

1125
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:15,360
the the fusing of infected some tissue is system where you just blew his physicality

1126
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:20,340
you blow some connections so that's less flexible in the sense that as soon as

1127
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:24,870
you have problems which you it's far far forward to ensure that it takes about

1128
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:27,600
what is good is that

1129
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:33,260
partition theory and information theory on because it's not issues is completely blind to audition

1130
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:37,230
yes harm is not blind to education so you could have because of addition you

1131
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:44,920
could send to shipping and then you have to to apply special tricks

1132
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:49,840
i said that very very useful in the in the in the county you is

1133
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,720
the fact that you have got its

1134
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:54,760
on the eighteenth and prepare

1135
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:56,230
high-speed so cellular

1136
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:59,580
and you have seen that in our application we see a lot of that on

1137
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,520
the continent on the from the front the

1138
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:05,560
so if we already the villages

1139
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,160
building began

1140
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:09,030
so because we would you like it

1141
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:13,240
from which we have an article since one could argue from the optical to electrical

1142
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:18,130
conversion we and the easiest and that so

1143
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:21,160
is the so-called get you from inside are good

1144
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:23,270
some kind of things today

1145
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:27,350
maximum speed that you can get to the point when given best which which is

1146
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:29,380
a lot so

1147
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:33,660
and you are one of them as you would so there are a number of

1148
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:37,410
of on those forces fifty years

1149
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:42,460
most popular magazines and they are

1150
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:47,650
exactly this is the is one of the of the first one use of this

1151
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:51,430
kind of device was

1152
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:53,900
more than twenty years ago when

1153
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:59,950
and you have a different different from formula

1154
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:03,830
then i can the is is

1155
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:10,450
in a flash based on tissue so we've got a lot of these devices in

1156
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:16,470
and it's experiment because of the addition of everything we can to make them

1157
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:18,770
and others

1158
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:24,060
the devices which are available so if we take design is the vertex six of

1159
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:30,450
process which uses fourteen nanometer process seems forces you can get energy two

1160
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:34,760
twelve of the input output be cheaper

1161
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:38,420
a lot of input output you can get

1162
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:44,770
close to the meaning of logic says that immediate needs for a close to forty

1163
01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:46,700
million seven million

1164
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:52,360
two thousand DSP slices so that you can use for that image processing on a

1165
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:57,270
two thirty six i italian consular if you want to edit the it's because you

1166
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:58,670
can use the same

1167
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:07,680
a bit more you know saying that you have also some general-purpose processor inside and

1168
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,180
so of course when i say to you do not have a device which i

1169
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:18,900
got all of the neuron in the familiar you can select what what

1170
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:21,840
most that

1171
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:27,080
so in addition these devices is that

1172
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:33,680
something extracted from the veins presentations since

1173
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,450
in twenty of the number of

1174
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:44,660
system of structural equations again very briefly describe what about very very briefly related very

1175
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:50,990
closely related to that the graphical representations in case what what's called path diagrams which

1176
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:53,950
if you like can be thought of as the precursors

1177
01:23:53,970 --> 01:24:02,580
to the modern theory of graphical models and particularly directed a cyclic graphs

1178
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,600
so what we're going to particularly concentrate on in these lectures

1179
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:11,990
the use of probability distributions and the slide extension using what i call extended conditional

1180
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:19,040
as the fundamental building blocks and the use where appropriate which is not one a

1181
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,850
hundred percent of the time

1182
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:25,990
of directed acyclic graph representations to

1183
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:30,790
describe the problem and analyse and manipulate

1184
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:35,100
but also say something about something other topics there

1185
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:54,740
right so he has

1186
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:59,270
a simple provides many many of you will live

1187
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:02,740
dance some very basic introductory statistics course

1188
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,720
statistics one o one

1189
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,100
where you

1190
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,220
i mean the

1191
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:12,450
comparative trials

1192
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:18,910
those of you do give the treatment of controlled by neutrino variables zero one

1193
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:23,750
zero control what exactly treatment

1194
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:28,510
you measure some response variable and you basically interested in

1195
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:32,290
the difference may be the difference in the main between the treated and untreated due

1196
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:37,020
to be learned about the two sample t test so one sample

1197
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:37,720
it is

1198
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:38,700
two samples

1199
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:40,930
in this case for example

1200
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:46,660
so that that's pretty much the basic statistics get nevertheless there are different things we

1201
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,370
can do with it

1202
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:53,120
the same for the time being i think of the various the simplest case of

1203
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,700
a randomized experiment so

1204
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:59,910
we're not we don't have these problems of the observation studies are we comparing like

1205
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:04,490
with like we've tossed penny to decide who gets the treatment

1206
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:09,990
so if we do see differences between them we can interpret them as genuinely do

1207
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:11,700
to the treatment

1208
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:14,180
i'll also say that

1209
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:17,810
i'm not going to be concerned with inference in the t distribution

1210
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:23,250
most of what i'm going to talk about is not the add that what i

1211
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:28,120
got is the second level of you know what the bread-and-butter will statistics courses is

1212
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:31,750
the sort of inference from data when you haven't got enough data and you don't

1213
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:36,560
know things we showed go to quantify or uncertainty that's fine but i'm really

1214
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:40,120
almost everything i'm going to say is predicated on the idea that you could actually

1215
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,160
know the underlying

1216
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:46,990
you've got enough data enormous amounts of data and a lot of the problems have

1217
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:50,120
still not gone away

1218
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:54,740
this request is having got all those protein distribution of other relevant to my question

1219
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:56,580
one my going to do

1220
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:01,520
so the problem of statistical inference actually a little wrinkle on top of the problems

1221
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:05,450
of what might call identification understanding the structure of the problem

1222
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:10,060
so let's see how my we

1223
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:16,520
the final measure what we might intuitively called the effect of the treatment we got

1224
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,540
this data we

1225
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,850
how we had how good is the treatment compared with the control

1226
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:28,850
fisher basically told us what the

1227
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:35,490
from the we got these two groups two arms of the experiment treatment arm control

1228
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:40,060
arm in the treatment lot of data so we can estimate the distribution of the

1229
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:42,490
response in the treatment

1230
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:47,640
normal that's for simplicity does matter called normal women one and variance sigma square we

1231
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:50,450
know the parameters OK we love them

1232
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:57,790
similarly in the control arm we've got another normal distribution what any distribution doesn't matter

1233
01:27:57,870 --> 01:28:01,370
with a different mean which we've got from the data museo maybe the same there

1234
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:03,160
is that doesn't matter either

1235
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:07,990
OK so just example think of the standard sort t test formulation with the distributions

1236
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:11,770
can be up to the point is we know them one distribution for treatment

1237
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:19,200
that's the distribution response were treated group and a different distribution typically for the control

1238
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:22,640
colin p one and p zero as well

1239
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:26,640
and then they and the answer is in a sense quite simple we've got these

1240
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:30,910
two distributions and we going to do is compare that doesn't solve the problem because

1241
01:28:30,910 --> 01:28:34,620
there are many many ways in which we can compare two different distributions i'm not

1242
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:37,430
going to force you to choose one way or another way that up to you

1243
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:40,470
depending on the context of your problem

1244
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:44,640
but some are the going to do a comparison between these two distributions if they

1245
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:49,460
in polynomial time but i won't into that that's a major problem in this area

1246
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:54,440
of linear programming the ellipsoid algorithm was the first algorithm to solve linear programming in

1247
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:57,580
polynomial time so for a long time people didn't know

1248
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:03,080
around this time people start realizing polynomial time good thing that happened around late sixties

1249
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:05,140
polynomial time is good

1250
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:10,980
and they sort of the first one to do is very general and very powerful

1251
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:13,190
theoretically completely impractical

1252
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:14,390
but it's cool

1253
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:18,000
it lets you do things like you can solve the linear programme that has exponentially

1254
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,230
many constraints in polynomial time

1255
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:27,830
all sorts of crazy things so it's not just a polynomial time can't say something

1256
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:32,120
nice about it and say well OK it's impractical

1257
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:36,600
interior point methods are sort of the the mixture they run in polynomial time you

1258
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,670
can guarantee that

1259
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:43,100
and there are also pretty practical and this sort of this competition these days about

1260
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:46,690
whether simplex or interior point is better and i don't know what it is today

1261
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:51,620
but a few years ago they were neck-and-neck and random sampling is a brand new

1262
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:55,210
approach this is just from a couple years ago by two

1263
01:29:55,230 --> 01:29:56,540
MIT professors

1264
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:04,870
respect CMS and santosh vempala both ones in e guess the others like math so

1265
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:07,620
just to show you is there is active work in this area people are still

1266
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:12,140
finding new ways to solve linear programs this is completely randomized and very simple and

1267
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:16,480
very general hasn't been implemented so we don't know how practical it is yet but

1268
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,210
has potential

1269
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:26,210
OK we're going to look at a somewhat simpler version of linear programming

1270
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:32,100
the first restriction we're going to make is actually not much restriction but

1271
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:34,660
unless we will

1272
01:30:36,310 --> 01:30:42,310
a little bit easier to think about so here

1273
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:47,730
we had some polytope we want to maximize some objective you feasibility problem i just

1274
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:50,900
want to know is the polytope to empty can you find any point in the

1275
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:57,850
polytope can you find any set of values x that satisfy these constraints so there

1276
01:30:57,850 --> 01:30:59,620
is no objective

1277
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:07,390
just find x such that

1278
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,540
the axis classical b

1279
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:13,710
it turns out you can provide very general theorem that if you can solve linear

1280
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:17,350
feasibility you could also solve linear programming

1281
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:23,170
one present here is actually no easier than the original problem even though feels easier

1282
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:25,310
it's easier to think about

1283
01:31:25,330 --> 01:31:29,560
actually no easier than LP

1284
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:43,790
OK the next restriction like to make is a real restriction simplifies the problem quite

1285
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:44,420
a bit

1286
01:31:47,040 --> 01:32:01,520
and and that's the difference constraints

1287
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:11,790
and all the same to track so far we now

1288
01:32:11,810 --> 01:32:19,670
ground suffer little bit so a system of difference constraints is a linear feasibility problem

1289
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:23,440
so it's LP where there's no objective

1290
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:32,640
and his with the restrictions somewhere

1291
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:34,750
each row of the matrix

1292
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:46,890
so the matrix

1293
01:32:46,890 --> 01:32:50,500
has one

1294
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,890
and it has one minus one

1295
01:32:55,940 --> 01:33:00,670
and everything else in the in the row is zero

1296
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:05,250
OK in other words

1297
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:14,190
each constraint very simple form involves two variables

1298
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:19,980
and some numbers so we have something like the next day

1299
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:25,250
minus x y is less than or equal to w i j

1300
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:30,160
so this is just the number these are two variables a minus sign no no

1301
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:33,710
values up here coefficients no other of vx

1302
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:34,790
cases appear

1303
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:36,390
just to the

1304
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:40,000
and you have a bunch of constraints of this form it one per row of

1305
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,350
the matrix

1306
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:46,170
i haven't thought about what this means

1307
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:49,790
i think it means the hyperplanes are pretty simple

1308
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:53,710
so we can do better than a little hard to see this in high dimensions

1309
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:56,390
but it will start to

1310
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:00,310
correspond something we've seen namely the board the next

1311
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:02,400
very short

1312
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,520
OK so let's do very quick

1313
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,920
only to have something to point

1314
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,190
all the when

1315
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:14,500
this system changes completely the behaviour

1316
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:17,270
which was following

1317
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:21,020
taking into account these

1318
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:28,770
and the composition which formally applies only to linear system but conceptually is the general

1319
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:37,880
view of all dynamical system we can understand better our modelling for the water level

1320
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:40,380
are located

1321
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:44,070
OK so

1322
01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:49,900
let's move to the second part of the of the talk which is talking a

1323
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:52,170
little bit more about more than

1324
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:54,290
now we just so

1325
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:57,340
a one way of modelling

1326
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:05,750
our dynamical systems and then our time series which is using state equations

1327
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:12,290
out equations differential equations or difference equations

1328
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:17,270
they can go into account that for certain kind of systems

1329
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:23,820
which are systems that it is always possible to write the dynamical system using first

1330
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:29,070
a set of first-order differential equations

1331
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:32,500
so we have limited our analysis just one

1332
01:35:32,530 --> 01:35:33,750
kind of

1333
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:36,670
modelling of view of the system

1334
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:39,270
as a matter of fact we already so

1335
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:40,800
he said that

1336
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:46,570
when we have a system and we start from the very start instead of starting

1337
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:55,340
then the knowledge about the internal structure of the system we can use the input

1338
01:35:55,340 --> 01:36:00,940
output or black small block sorry black box warning

1339
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:04,770
we can

1340
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:09,500
using this system is what it what we call the

1341
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:12,460
these are somehow different with respect to the

1342
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,250
way of approaching the system

1343
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:23,000
interim more dynamic differential equations and what is the basic idea

1344
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:29,270
the heart this kind of system well the idea is that the input output representation

1345
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:31,400
it tells us

1346
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:35,690
a lot of things about the system even if i don't know exactly what are

1347
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:38,880
the state variable but i'm able to

1348
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:44,190
have in good insight about this is that if we met but we go back

1349
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:46,300
to that sold to this point but

1350
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,300
if we we remember

1351
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,790
the column and the composition

1352
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:54,070
in some way using you put out modelling

1353
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:56,110
say well i hope

1354
01:36:56,130 --> 01:37:02,840
the system is completely reachable and observable OK i hope the timeline here and then

1355
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:05,690
i will try to model in some way

1356
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:07,820
what i'm not able to

1357
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:13,360
put into the input output more something else like noise

1358
01:37:17,770 --> 01:37:22,210
i'm trying to say well i would like to stay here actually and i think

1359
01:37:22,210 --> 01:37:29,630
that these is enough to describe what's happening to the system

1360
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:32,110
in this case the outcome of the so

1361
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:34,150
i just need the

1362
01:37:34,210 --> 01:37:35,440
two more than

1363
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:43,520
the input output relationship and then to estimate the parameters of this model using the

1364
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:47,150
using some good

1365
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:51,440
you may to do that

1366
01:37:51,480 --> 01:38:00,300
we already talked about the idea of was restless and transfer function we don't talk

1367
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:05,750
we will not talk about convolution of the convolution models because we don't have time

1368
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:09,750
but just to tell you that the examples of

1369
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:14,590
become modelling in the case of

1370
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:16,440
drug distribution

1371
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,530
over time we have here

1372
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:25,480
it's a simple input output more than

1373
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,230
which bordered these

1374
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:34,050
a system in which we have we have even asserting the right to the patient

1375
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:35,480
at time zero

1376
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:41,030
and we certainly over time the drug plasma drug concentration

1377
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:45,750
we use in this case instead of using a state space model

1378
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:51,150
we just use input output more which relates the inputs so i'll drug to the

1379
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:57,230
output of the measurement of drug concentration over time and you see here that these

1380
01:38:57,230 --> 01:39:00,530
models may have hansen and no parameters

1381
01:39:00,550 --> 01:39:02,920
which are these in fact

1382
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:08,300
that we have to estimate from the using proper estimation

1383
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:11,920
make the least squares squares or

1384
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:13,840
maximum likelihood

1385
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:18,050
or any of the method that you probably already a soul

1386
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:23,320
within this scores

1387
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:29,900
of course we already sell systems and systems modeling what i would like to say

1388
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:34,670
it's one of the point also all the edges of the ribbon reading the book

1389
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:37,270
is that when we are

1390
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:40,980
approaching the problem of

1391
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:49,670
modelling inside the the systems using state variables we are of course in more

1392
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:55,630
if a knowledge about the current about the

1393
01:39:55,650 --> 01:40:01,360
real functioning of the system and we can try

1394
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:09,210
to arrive the search in a representation of the system you again what the

1395
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:19,550
compartmental models that we have used the exact is examples of a before well we

1396
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:27,860
with respect to the data modelling we we are using these notion of the state

1397
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:32,150
equations and our goal of course is trying to

1398
01:40:32,170 --> 01:40:34,050
compliments the view

1399
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:37,090
all this is the

1400
01:40:37,110 --> 01:40:44,960
voting for example some knowledge or guesses about the overall system OK so also made

1401
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:46,550
parts which are

1402
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:56,300
not necessarily reachable in the end of suitable

1403
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:59,020
OK talking about

1404
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:04,170
time series for completeness say a

1405
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:06,230
it's important to

1406
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,480
not only

1407
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:14,270
deterministic models but also

1408
01:41:14,290 --> 01:41:17,900
two bodies which are

1409
01:41:20,530 --> 01:41:26,770
applied in the analysis of time series when i just have a a collection of

1410
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:30,150
input output they or maybe also

1411
01:41:30,170 --> 01:41:32,610
only all out

1412
01:41:32,630 --> 01:41:35,300
because sometimes i don't have exactly

1413
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:39,480
my good little small current running through the voltmeter that you see the that's so

1414
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:41,000
small that

1415
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:43,340
can always ignore these you get double

1416
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:45,760
you might

1417
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:47,070
now what i will do

1418
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:49,610
so i have now about two vols

1419
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:53,020
between these two plates

1420
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:55,540
two batteries in series

1421
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:58,660
and i have a little bit like both here

1422
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:02,010
and i'm going to

1423
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:03,900
turn on the light

1424
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:05,620
and now what you'll see

1425
01:42:05,630 --> 01:42:08,940
is that the voltage that you measure right here that's all you can do you

1426
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:11,000
can only measure the voltage

1427
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:14,710
at the plates of the battery that now this voltage will drop

1428
01:42:14,730 --> 01:42:18,580
because of the internal resistance of the battery in addition you will see some light

1429
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:20,750
but that's really not my objective

1430
01:42:20,770 --> 01:42:23,970
those of you who was sitting close you can see is light bulb

1431
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:24,930
going to be lit

1432
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:26,870
if i do this now

1433
01:42:26,910 --> 01:42:29,510
i can see the light bulb a little bit of light

1434
01:42:29,530 --> 01:42:32,500
notice that the voltage goes down

1435
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:36,140
and so this value that you measure now

1436
01:42:36,230 --> 01:42:37,290
you will be

1437
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:38,740
now lower

1438
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:42,500
and the one point nine holds because of this term you lose

1439
01:42:43,770 --> 01:42:46,720
the battery internal resistance

1440
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:48,340
you lose their

1441
01:42:48,350 --> 01:42:52,620
potential difference

1442
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:59,500
so let's take this out because this produces a lot of

1443
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:04,550
a a lot of smelly fields

1444
01:43:08,770 --> 01:43:13,040
that's fine

1445
01:43:13,050 --> 01:43:14,990
if the charge

1446
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,880
moves from point a to point b

1447
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,050
and here the potential

1448
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:21,860
three eight

1449
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:24,390
and here the potential is creepy

1450
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:30,860
and charge dq move that suppose for simplicity

1451
01:43:30,910 --> 01:43:33,900
that the

1452
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:37,130
the mind a

1453
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:41,010
now let's let's make the a larger than VB just a little easier to thinking

1454
01:43:41,010 --> 01:43:47,040
that those terms it's not necessary to collapse may be a larger than he

1455
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:50,110
the electric field from a to b

1456
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:51,450
and i move charge

1457
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:53,240
from a to b

1458
01:43:53,290 --> 01:43:56,360
then the electric field is doing work

1459
01:43:56,370 --> 01:44:00,380
and the work that the electric field is doing the w

1460
01:44:00,430 --> 01:44:02,880
is the charge

1461
01:44:02,970 --> 01:44:07,410
i the potential difference which is to be a minus b

1462
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:13,090
this work

1463
01:44:13,170 --> 01:44:14,750
can be positive

1464
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:16,300
if the charge is positive

1465
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,330
the negative charge is negative

1466
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:23,410
because we have assumed that this is possible in this case

1467
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:26,380
i can now do something that you shouldn't tell

1468
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:28,330
your math teachers

1469
01:44:28,410 --> 01:44:30,820
physicists do it all the time

1470
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:32,300
we defined by dt

1471
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:39,370
and i would say half of we have on the left side is no work

1472
01:44:39,490 --> 01:44:43,430
unit time that's power joules per second

1473
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:46,610
so there is no squalor

1474
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:49,090
pqt genes current

1475
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:51,730
how many calls per second flow

1476
01:44:51,770 --> 01:44:54,260
so this is current i

1477
01:44:54,270 --> 01:44:59,210
and the potential difference i simply call use that symbol v

1478
01:44:59,230 --> 01:45:01,220
so you see now you that

1479
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:02,920
power the liver

1480
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:04,650
by a

1481
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:06,910
power supply

1482
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:10,360
is the current that it produces

1483
01:45:10,410 --> 01:45:13,760
times the potential difference

1484
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:18,380
and this is independent of ohms law there's always holds

1485
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:20,630
if you also includes

1486
01:45:20,690 --> 01:45:21,870
ohms law

1487
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:22,910
if you can

1488
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:25,020
we use it

1489
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:28,720
last time we discussed the limitations of but if you can use it and vehicles

1490
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:29,850
i are

1491
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:30,850
then of course

1492
01:45:30,850 --> 01:45:35,040
you can also write down for the power that his eyes grey are

1493
01:45:35,130 --> 01:45:37,950
and is also be created

1494
01:45:38,010 --> 01:45:42,810
divided by our

1495
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:46,540
power is joules per second

1496
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:47,620
when we write

1497
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:48,760
for that

1498
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:52,320
due the second we write for that what

1499
01:45:52,330 --> 01:45:55,080
just the capitol w

1500
01:45:57,130 --> 01:46:00,060
named after the physicist what

1501
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:04,310
we always express the power in terms of what's

1502
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:06,800
so suppose we have a

1503
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,370
resistance are

1504
01:46:09,390 --> 01:46:12,580
and we want to current through it

1505
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:14,400
this resistance

1506
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:17,630
and we want to current i through it

1507
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:23,630
and let's take an example that the current i is one and here

1508
01:46:23,650 --> 01:46:26,110
and that the resistance

1509
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:29,050
is one hundred o

1510
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:32,680
and the power which is dissipated in this

1511
01:46:34,130 --> 01:46:36,220
to be provided by a battery

1512
01:46:36,270 --> 01:46:37,770
that power

1513
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:38,550
is is now

1514
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,130
one hundred watts

1515
01:46:42,170 --> 01:46:43,690
i squared r

1516
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:45,610
you want to use this

1517
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:48,040
it has two and

1518
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:50,450
you don't change the resistance

1519
01:46:50,510 --> 01:46:52,770
and he becomes four hundred watts

1520
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:56,190
i square are idols

1521
01:46:57,530 --> 01:46:59,630
four times higher

1522
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:01,810
o was energy

1523
01:47:01,810 --> 01:47:05,260
this debate in the form of heat

1524
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:06,910
and if it gets hot enough

1525
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:11,530
maybe you can produce light the idea behind the light bulb

1526
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:15,170
the element into in tungsten incandescent light bulb

1527
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:16,260
becomes very high

1528
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:17,130
twenty five

1529
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:20,650
under a degree centigrade maybe even three thousand

1530
01:47:20,660 --> 01:47:23,670
not so high of course that the tungsten melts

1531
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:24,970
and so

1532
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:27,960
you begin to see light

1533
01:47:27,970 --> 01:47:31,200
so for instance a hundred what

1534
01:47:31,210 --> 01:47:33,260
the light bulb

1535
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:35,880
four from here

1536
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:39,130
so if we have a hundred watt light bulb dormitory

1537
01:47:39,230 --> 01:47:46,550
and the voltage

1538
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,840
it's on the ten of just

1539
01:47:48,850 --> 01:47:50,740
plug it into the wall

1540
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:52,460
and the currents

1541
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:56,040
that run is about o point nine mps

1542
01:47:56,050 --> 01:48:01,260
it was VI

1543
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:02,790
this product

1544
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:04,320
the hope

1545
01:48:04,330 --> 01:48:06,570
and then the resistance

1546
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:08,080
that you have

1547
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:10,610
is about a hundred and twenty on

1548
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:19,200
because i are

1549
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:22,050
so even though

1550
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:26,170
well not really i mean the original out of this algorithm looks like

1551
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:31,330
and adaboost has an exponential the log there's renormalisation

1552
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:33,150
well this looks completely different

1553
01:48:33,170 --> 01:48:37,180
but the funny thing is that this thing take everything into account to get from

1554
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:41,240
here to here is just an analytical squish there's no approximation

1555
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:46,240
and the reduction from here to here uses the fact that is the binary matrix

1556
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:52,590
so what this is in fact is an iterated map because it's an equation for

1557
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:56,100
the weight vector at time t plus one in terms of the weight vector at

1558
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:57,450
time t

1559
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:00,900
so gives us a way to directly update the weight vector

1560
01:49:00,930 --> 01:49:05,010
and the existence of this map really enables the study of low dimensional cases so

1561
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:06,760
that's exactly what i'm going to do now

1562
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:11,900
so i say well i had this tool can analyse what dimensional case here goes

1563
01:49:11,950 --> 01:49:14,760
this the simplest case that i could come up with

1564
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:19,020
this is the case where the major families like this we have three weak classifiers

1565
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:24,380
three training instances each classifier misclassifies one training instance

1566
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:26,900
OK now the weight vector

1567
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:29,820
remember we have three training examples

1568
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:33,830
the weight vector has three components and their

1569
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:37,380
probability they form a discrete probability distribution

1570
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:40,950
on the on the instances so what i'm talking about is the fact that the

1571
01:49:41,390 --> 01:49:44,590
the weight vector is always lies somewhere in this nation complex

1572
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:47,620
but i didn't feel like plugging things on the simplex

1573
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:49,190
so what i'm going to do

1574
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:52,420
it's going to be putting a lot of triangles are going to do is i'm

1575
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:56,430
going to take the simplex in squash it onto the purple triangle

1576
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:59,620
so when i'm writing triangles in the future what i'm going to be plotting is

1577
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:03,630
the simplex projected onto the first two dimensions DT one and DT two

1578
01:50:03,650 --> 01:50:05,070
and what i'm going to do

1579
01:50:05,090 --> 01:50:08,660
as i'm going to start somewhere in the simplex right in the middle simplex where

1580
01:50:08,660 --> 01:50:11,270
the weight vector is just one thirty one thirty one thirty

1581
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:14,280
and then i'm going to send out into the dynamical system

1582
01:50:14,670 --> 01:50:17,090
tell me where to go to the next iteration so i'm going to be topping

1583
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:18,920
all around the simplex and

1584
01:50:18,950 --> 01:50:21,850
well you know what you'll see is going to be jumping around on the on

1585
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:23,710
this trying on purple triangle

1586
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:27,800
according to the dynamics and that's exactly what what i was doing

1587
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:31,950
OK so the question remember what i'm doing

1588
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,410
and at each iteration

1589
01:50:34,430 --> 01:50:39,170
when i i just wanted to do this you could follow the dynamics earlier iterations

1590
01:50:39,170 --> 01:50:43,240
one can apply more blue circles and later iterations and apply large red circles and

1591
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:46,800
the time increases the circle gets larger and larger and they happen to get more

1592
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:49,590
and more red the the college not important that it's really the size of the

1593
01:50:49,690 --> 01:50:51,850
support OK so so

1594
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:54,580
i'm going to start security one

1595
01:50:54,590 --> 01:50:59,580
with the weight vectors being all equal so pt one is one thirty two two

1596
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:03,090
one thirty and DT three is just one minus the humanity t one which is

1597
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:04,310
one third

1598
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:06,400
so it's here

1599
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:09,990
i think this and i sent into the dynamical system and it tells me where

1600
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:13,730
to go next and in fact it tells me to go over here

1601
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:18,290
so any guesses as to where it's going next

1602
01:51:18,450 --> 01:51:21,540
and it's impossible to figure it out i'm going to put all these articles up

1603
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:24,910
so you can see where the

1604
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:26,860
so you can see what's going on here

1605
01:51:26,910 --> 01:51:28,570
at equals three

1606
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:32,850
we end up actually over here at equals before we end up here articles five

1607
01:51:32,870 --> 01:51:38,100
here people six here people seven here people eight equals nine people ten eleven twelve

1608
01:51:39,250 --> 01:51:42,940
converting to cycle the weight is converging to cycle

1609
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:47,890
OK so what's really going on here so let me let me analyse the for

1610
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:52,770
so what happens is that the first step in the street in our tracks

1611
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:57,300
what that does is it divides the simplex into three regions there is one region

1612
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:01,530
where you choose we classify one one region which is classified to the regional wages

1613
01:52:01,530 --> 01:52:02,990
we classify three

1614
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:07,950
and the next step what it does is it projects each triangle to align

1615
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:12,240
so the data of one triangle gets projected onto this line over here

1616
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:15,640
it it was triangle ends up here in the eighty three triangle ends up over

1617
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:18,310
here so that in one iteration

1618
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:19,380
they are

1619
01:52:19,410 --> 01:52:24,570
the the dynamics on the dynamical system on the two dimensional simplex becomes the one-dimensional

1620
01:52:24,570 --> 01:52:25,870
iterated map on the

1621
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:28,040
and the edges of the inner triangle

1622
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:31,560
and then from there what happens is that different chunks of the triangle map to

1623
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:32,640
other chunks

1624
01:52:32,670 --> 01:52:33,360
by a

1625
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:38,510
montana contraction in fact so this child gets knocked over here which gets better here

1626
01:52:38,510 --> 01:52:40,810
which gets mapped to a subset of the

1627
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:45,820
so what happens is that within three iterations each chunk of the triangle gets mapped

1628
01:52:45,820 --> 01:52:49,320
to a subset of itself by monotonic contractions

1629
01:52:49,370 --> 01:52:51,280
so you get nice fixed point

1630
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:52,790
because everything

1631
01:52:52,810 --> 01:52:57,480
so there are in fact six fixed points there are three fixed point three to

1632
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:59,530
two possible cycles

1633
01:52:59,550 --> 01:53:02,800
so what in the world is you talking about well

1634
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:04,710
the thing is what i'm saying here

1635
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:08,840
if that converted to a cycle of here but it could equally converge to another

1636
01:53:09,690 --> 01:53:10,890
over here

1637
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:14,450
o point he's gonna ask me well how does that know which cycle to converge

1638
01:53:14,450 --> 01:53:16,610
to well known

1639
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:18,400
it was like to converge to

1640
01:53:18,410 --> 01:53:20,130
because of this that

1641
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:24,350
this is this is jt is in argmax blah blah blah blah blah

1642
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:29,020
so there could be more than one element in that set

1643
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:33,410
in fact the very first iteration of adaboost there's three elements in the set

1644
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,660
it doesn't know which of the weak classifiers to pick

1645
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:39,680
because all of them all of them are the best we classify for the job

1646
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:41,610
so it makes an arbitrary decision

1647
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:46,080
and then iteration two it also makes an arbitrary decision between the weak classifiers and

1648
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:51,180
those two arbitrary decisions determine which of the two possible cycles adaboost converges

1649
01:53:51,230 --> 01:53:55,380
and the nice thing is that i can actually calculate the coordinates of these of

1650
01:53:55,390 --> 01:53:56,640
the fixed point

1651
01:53:56,660 --> 01:53:58,530
by using this equation

1652
01:53:58,530 --> 01:54:00,090
it just comes right up

1653
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:05,590
OK now the nice thing about this temple is that the maximum margin solution is

1654
01:54:05,590 --> 01:54:06,850
actually team

1655
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:10,920
the maximum margin in this case is one third adaboost actually choose the maximum margin

1656
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:15,210
so when i was studying this this is obviously the first case that i but

1657
01:54:15,210 --> 01:54:18,050
i was looking at because you know this is the case where can really analyse

1658
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:22,180
that and here you know maximum margin solution is attained and no one would ever

1659
01:54:22,180 --> 01:54:27,110
proof before that was achieved the maximum margin solution so i will present all my

1660
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:31,640
goodness this conjecture must be true at this must always achieve maximum margin solution

1661
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:34,630
and i was studying statistical learning theory at the time and i should have known
