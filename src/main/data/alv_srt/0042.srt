1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
periodic functions

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,900
so one way of generating periodic functions is to

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,800
start from the axes but then map the axes

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,500
the space corresponding to

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,150
because going to sin x and cos sin x

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,970
so if you look at the first look at x and the new map it

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,520
into this two-dimensional space

8
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,400
and say OK it should be a smooth function

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,710
of the latent

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,230
variable u

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,650
so not just place a galson process in the u space

12
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,760
then you can work out what is the covariance now as a function of the

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,230
values of x y you get this expression here

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,920
where it has

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,880
in principle has two parameters product that tells you how fast is the period

16
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,110
which is set to one here the period is one of the sky could multiply

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,090
this by thing and then it has this smoothness

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:59,230
the squared exponential kernel that lives in the conventional that in the new space

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,710
missus l here

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,960
so here are again three different functions that are sampled from

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,570
so the samples of

22
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,530
of periodic smooth functions

23
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,360
but we don't say anything about the shape of the function

24
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,840
so here one where the

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,150
where the length scale

26
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,170
quite long compared to the period

27
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,530
that means

28
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,750
if the function can actually do very much within the period

29
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,090
because it's constrained to come back

30
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,670
to be periodic

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,960
here's here are functions drawn from a distribution where the length scale problem has been

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,360
the function is free to do stuff

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,710
inside period to get these are interesting looking function

34
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:46,920
which are guaranteed people to to be periodic

35
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,520
so here's here's an example

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,800
sort of a little bit artificial example because you probably wouldn't do inference in this

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,550
dataset in this way

38
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,800
i think it illustrates quite nicely the way

39
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,030
that you can use

40
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,150
different properties of the covariance functions to actually model

41
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,150
real data and and in this notion that you can look at our promises and

42
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,550
i'll tell you something about

43
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:16,460
what's going on so this is the observations of carbon dioxide concentrations monthly measurements four

44
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,170
fifty some odd years

45
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,650
and you can sort see that this is that this upward trend

46
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,380
one thing that might be interested in is what had what's going to happen in

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,650
the future

48
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,780
so i'm going to treat this

49
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,400
just as the regression task

50
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,710
just the one dimensional regression problem i want to predict what is why

51
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,530
as a function of x

52
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,030
probably if i want to do this in practice

53
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,050
i would also want to know something about

54
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,280
you know what happened to the world population in the same time and what happened

55
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,900
to his economic factors think that's the sort of the city where the

56
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,690
how do actually do this

57
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,900
well i don't know very much about atmospheric physics here but i can sort of

58
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,570
look at the data and i can say well

59
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,230
there seems to be at least the sort of this sort of this trend

60
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,170
going on here i situation should have some way of modelling that kind of thing

61
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,670
that's what would be a good

62
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,500
the idea of modelling this sort of

63
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,340
small trend

64
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,340
well maybe one of these square exponential terms

65
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,690
so i put that in my comments function

66
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,230
OK so i have one term here which is just on the long-term smooth trend

67
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,240
and but actually i'm not particularly keen on saying exactly what the length scale of

68
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,920
because i simply don't know so i leave that up to free parameters so that

69
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,250
i eta two here

70
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,690
and also i don't really want to specify what the magnitude of that we're trying

71
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,900
to that given by theta one

72
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,380
also want to look a little bit more carefully i see well

73
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,070
there seems to be some some seasonal variation going here

74
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,130
so i went along direction

75
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,840
there is some seasonal variation going on

76
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,440
this has to do with the fact that

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
the biomass

78
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,360
take up you two from the atmosphere predominantly

79
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,800
in the summer

80
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,610
and there's more landmass and on the

81
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,380
northern hemisphere so

82
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,460
the net

83
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,460
uptake of of CO two from the atmosphere in the summer and that released in

84
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,960
the winter

85
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,940
know that what gives rise to this fluctuation

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,070
but actually we look at this thing

87
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,900
i'm not so sure whether this is

88
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
well this is

89
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,290
adding gamma nor

90
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,690
the first five

91
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,680
together nor

92
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,360
or not

93
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,280
so what we generation

94
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,530
five one five two

95
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,680
o five three these are all the formulae i'm going to start

96
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,840
x nor is gamma

97
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,140
so explore is equal to whatever where gamma was that i was given and now

98
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,310
i'm going to construct x one

99
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,000
however i can only say

100
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,990
if x nought

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,470
that's gamma

102
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,260
o five one

103
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,290
so we're going to assign phi one

104
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,840
two x nor if

105
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,600
x locally deduces

106
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,650
so if you pick that guy and you check with the phi one is reducible

107
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,460
locally deducible from x and if it is you add it

108
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,490
so you just made your x not bigger

109
00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:01,440
if it isn't negation

110
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,550
now you just repeat

111
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,840
you take five two

112
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,070
and you say whatever the answer was here

113
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,640
c where the fighter is deducible from that locally if it is then at its

114
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,140
negation and you just go through every one of those

115
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,290
it's an infinite process but

116
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,120
constructive here

117
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,510
then you take

118
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,150
the union of all of these xn one x two x three and every time

119
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,830
i adding on the formula or its negation

120
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,360
and at the end i take

121
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,290
every stage is deterministic what i mean by that i mean that all that stuff

122
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,450
OK why because i fyz deducible local

123
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,020
this is the classical notion so

124
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,170
if i or you let its negation

125
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,910
of course not effective

126
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,030
there's no way this in general

127
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,840
but that's fine

128
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,240
we're doing an infinite construction

129
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,570
now i not have

130
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,530
for a particular formula five why can't i edit

131
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:22,000
like and is

132
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,550
because if i did then some mixing with being

133
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,600
and then i be able to trace it all the way back to find where

134
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,190
became inconsistent that's the whole point i'm avoiding inconsistencies

135
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,100
so either your gamma not was inconsistent which is not a consistent gamma

136
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,160
or your step somewhere went wrong but the step is designed not to go

137
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,440
all right

138
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,870
one more

139
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,500
one k

140
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,700
because it depends on the choice

141
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,950
you give me a different mission

142
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,890
and i might get a different set

143
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,600
so in fact

144
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,670
depending on how you enumerate your formulae

145
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,340
i just wanted to show there is one i think of the money

146
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,730
they basically because what local did you

147
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,360
what local deducibility properties

148
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,680
that is a finite subset

149
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,650
and it gives you an actual

150
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,360
if i can use local deducibility

151
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,750
a finite set

152
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,380
can get into trouble because i have to start wearing only

153
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,490
and also there is the property of this local deducibility relation which aren't

154
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,740
precisely this

155
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,100
if i one and i don't like in

156
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:14,700
they actually you can go to this

157
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,700
OK so basically just doesn't work

158
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:22,430
if you use the form of deduction that i've given you you can't do

159
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:31,340
a maximal consistent set construction with the tation

160
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:38,540
you this deduction is not equal to local deduction not OK

161
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,310
because it's saying you're not allowed to use necessitation lasted right it's one of the

162
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,710
things that i say

163
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,460
you in order to do that the construction you have to go to this

164
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,290
there was another question somewhere

165
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,850
you have question

166
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,780
because the other way

167
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,880
the exercise somewhere here right

168
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,020
if it's locally deducible then it's deducible

169
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,610
but it's

170
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,950
exactly it's it's the deduction do that one half of the deduction theorem doesn't go

171
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,060
it's exactly that point

172
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,800
thank you you

173
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,630
that side to that side

174
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,550
so that's fine

175
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,090
got we've got a chain of consistent sets x not which is a subset of

176
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,490
x one which is a centre

177
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,900
max melody

178
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,380
well at every where whatever five choose with this phase in

179
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,470
or not right will sooner or later external come be put in or its negation

180
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,110
put so you have an externality

181
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,270
that ytxt are itself is consistent in other words when you take this union

182
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,160
you don't read

183
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,050
how do you prove that you say well suppose for a contradiction that inside that

184
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,460
somehow got in their right

185
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,320
then you know one of them

186
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,630
calculate the work that you have to do to bring all these charges in place

187
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,970
if it is easy you can take the electric field everywhere in space if you

188
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,110
know that and do an integration

189
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,100
over all space

190
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,070
we could do that for instance for

191
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,400
these two parallel plates now

192
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,490
and we can ask what is now the total

193
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,790
energy in these plates

194
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,090
in the field and at home i would advise you

195
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,150
do that the way that it's done in your book

196
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,240
whereby you actually assembled the charges minus q at the bottom and prosecute top

197
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,020
and you calculate how much work you have to do that's one approach i will

198
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,710
now to the other approach

199
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,950
and that is by simply saying

200
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,940
that the

201
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,700
in the field of these plane parallel plates

202
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,080
is the integral

203
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,440
of one have actually non-zero e

204
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,460
over the entire volume

205
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,070
of these two plates

206
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,030
and since the electric field is outside zero everywhere

207
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,010
it's very easy in the world

208
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,850
because i know the volume the volume that i have separation is h

209
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,970
so we still have a part of this volume that i have is simply a

210
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,590
times age and the electric field is constant

211
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,570
and so

212
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,720
i get here

213
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,170
this is one half

214
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,800
absolutely zero

215
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,690
for in

216
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,370
i want to i can write

217
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,100
sigma divided by actually non-zero

218
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,580
i can square that

219
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,290
it's doing integral over all space

220
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,700
i mean simply i get a times age is the volume of the box

221
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,050
so i get a

222
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,690
so this is not the total energy

223
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,300
that i have i was one

224
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,700
actually you have an absolutely zero gravity after long

225
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,410
i also remember that the charge q

226
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,490
on the plate

227
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,730
is a time sigma

228
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,670
and that the potential difference the

229
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,100
this now is not volume is the potential difference between the plates

230
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,510
is the electric field

231
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,290
times age

232
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:37,160
the electric field is constant to go from one place to the other interval don't

233
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,250
pl going from one place to be out of this we potential difference

234
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,820
so i can substitute that now in here

235
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,590
i can

236
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,090
take for a sigma

237
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,470
i can put in the q

238
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,810
you can also show

239
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,290
this is one half

240
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,160
the being out of potential difference between the plates

241
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,190
and so this is a rather fast way

242
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,630
but you can calculate

243
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,450
what the

244
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,100
the total energy is

245
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,680
in the field or

246
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,450
say the same thing the total work you have to do

247
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,500
was family

248
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,750
these charges or to say differently the total work you have to do to create

249
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,450
electric fields you have created they created electric fields that were not there

250
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,470
i know will introduce

251
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,090
something that we haven't had before

252
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,970
that's the word

253
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,250
i will defined

254
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,850
the capacitance of an object

255
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,130
to be

256
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,300
the charge of that object

257
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,340
divided by

258
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,430
the potential

259
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,840
of that object

260
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,460
and so the unit is

261
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,140
cool urls

262
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,920
before this useful knowledge potential

263
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,130
but we never say that school all of evolved physics we write for that the

264
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,970
capital at

265
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,180
which is far out

266
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,320
we call that one ferrari is the unit

267
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,670
of capacitance undoubtedly after the great maestro faraday

268
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,580
we'll learn more about fire they

269
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,640
later in this course so us

270
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,890
go to

271
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,670
a sphere which has a radius are

272
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,600
and that is calculate what the capacitance is obvious

273
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,670
think of it as being a conductor

274
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,170
and we bring this charge q on the conductor it will then get potential v

275
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,710
which we know is q

276
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,520
divided by four pi

277
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,350
actually non-zero are

278
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,460
we've seen it many times

279
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,460
and so

280
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,410
by definition

281
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,630
the capacitance now is q

282
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,990
divided by the potential

283
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,090
and therefore

284
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,370
this becomes

285
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,180
here are

286
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,700
that is the capacitance of a single

287
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,870
so we can now look at the

288
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,040
as a function of are

289
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,510
i have here some numbers

290
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,070
calculated for defender graph

291
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,270
i calculated forty earth

292
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,360
if you want one far-out capacitance

293
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:17,090
that's the real big unit radius of nine times ten to nine metres it's the

294
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,690
four pi actually non-zero comes in there

295
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,450
that's used that twenty five times the distance from the earth to the moon big

296
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,080
whatever patterns of one farad

297
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,850
itself with a radius of sixty four hundred kilometres

298
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,860
seven hundred for

299
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,740
invented around thirty centimetres radius would be for typical for picos ten to the minus

300
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,980
and if you take a sphere with a radius of one centimeter

301
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,340
then you have

302
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,170
roughly one bickel for ten to the minus

303
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,620
so far so this gives you a rough idea here

304
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,690
about the size of objects

305
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,000
and how they connect to their capacitance

306
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,590
so if i bring all these spheres

307
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,860
at the same potential

308
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,940
as we call them now

309
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,120
let's do

310
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,570
something first

311
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,380
i now

312
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:15,660
excluded mutation from this algorithm by setting its probability to zero

313
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,700
can somebody

314
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,920
predict what what is going to happen

315
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,790
and have to be able to find the solution

316
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,740
depends on the

317
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,760
initial population

318
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,910
you see

319
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,280
here we are

320
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,180
this is what happens

321
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,780
no mutations

322
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,800
no way

323
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,460
to get the solution

324
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,300
in the entire population

325
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,010
there's no

326
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,290
see it in a certain color

327
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,130
mutation is not just something to

328
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:07,360
perform random search component with this algorithms it is also very important because it can

329
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
or reintroduce

330
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,900
i needed

331
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:19,010
the genes are needed components into our population if they were not present at all

332
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,950
or if they were lost during the search procedure so it is very important

333
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:30,570
so of course this could run forever to stop it

334
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,170
and now

335
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,510
how about

336
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:43,690
increasing the mutation very much

337
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,570
let's say one point zero

338
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,260
what does it mean

339
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:54,040
if i said the probability of mutation to one

340
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:59,340
this means our algorithm actually turned to

341
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:06,420
random search right because this mechanism will be so strong that the only solution to

342
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,910
actually be generated randomly

343
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:15,550
in this case we can forget about crossover about the selection it has no role

344
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,360
because we actually generate every solution randomly so

345
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,020
you see everything grey area

346
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:27,730
the programme works now

347
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:48,710
this test the efficiency of random search on this problem

348
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:56,940
by the way what is the number of possible solutions

349
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,220
yes right ten to the power of ten because it's

350
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,320
ten digits and ten

351
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,700
values at each position

352
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,310
and again

353
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,030
i hope this

354
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,120
simple them all

355
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,940
convinced you of the efficiency of the evolutionary search

356
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,390
we had let's say

357
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,840
something about

358
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,620
one thousand or even less

359
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,810
solutions checked on average

360
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,850
so this is really a small proportion of the entire state space

361
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,910
it's ten to the power of ten

362
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,820
the number of solutions

363
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,930
OK this one really is this one is not too successful but we can see

364
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,190
the best solution found so far was with eight correct digits

365
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,050
and then we are quite lucky but

366
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,250
do not enough

367
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,850
not enough to

368
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:56,260
the optimum solution that's the number that is generated in the background

369
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:09,000
still with genetic algorithms from toy from

370
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:31,310
then all problems to more realistic problems

371
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,620
it's that here

372
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,880
so this is just for an illustration we saw

373
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:45,930
five problems saw of demonstration of the efficiency of these algorithms this is a short

374
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:53,450
illustration of the practical industrial problem where genetic algorithms was used it is actually from

375
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,980
one of the projects done by this institute in one of the steel plants here

376
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,540
in slovenia called the chronic still plant

377
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,660
i do a short but just to explain the essence of the problem and the

378
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,610
way the genetic algorithms was used

379
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,170
the problem is as follows means

380
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,510
work on the continuous casting of steel

381
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,380
which is the process of producing steel that is then used for

382
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:30,880
producing any kinds of for project products so

383
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:38,110
what happens here is that liquid still that comes from the furnace actually and a

384
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,860
certain device which is called continuous caster

385
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,980
and this device or this machine actually

386
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,650
cools down

387
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,710
the steel

388
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,150
and it's just is solidified and these

389
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,910
he the so-called cutting point where the is cut

390
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,500
maximum likelihood is consistent

391
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,850
as we increase these data points the parameters become better determined by the way you

392
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:06,910
demonstrate maximum likelihood is consistent is by looking at kehl divergences between the true distribution

393
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,440
you don't know

394
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,430
and you approximating distribution you assume you approximating distribution is in the class

395
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:13,860
the true distribution

396
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,340
and you show that you can get a sample based approximations about cayley budgets which is the likelihood

397
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,360
that's sample-based approximation gains infinite data points

398
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,440
u will recover

399
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,140
the cat true cayley evidence minimization

400
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:34,090
that's not true here because the sampling is being done across data features

401
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:40,800
so this is consistent has you get in the data features for a fixed number of data points

402
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,420
in this case when a man comes into office saying i can give you one

403
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,880
hundred extra data points about the case you are interested in you know about will

404
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,900
make my parameters less well determined

405
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,520
don't give me any more data points that's the converse so the guy who came

406
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,720
in saying here's a hundred extra data features

407
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,290
so the blessing and dimensionality

408
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:08,730
which is exactly the consequence analyzing model independent across features shows u u want many

409
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,140
many more data features and you don't want any more data points

410
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,880
so it's exactly the opposite lesson

411
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:16,630
from the normal

412
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,360
of-course it's all a little bit of a joke because it's just about your model

413
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,570
definition it's nothing to do with your data

414
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,900
so i think a lot of those ideas about large piece more than being a

415
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,650
problem should be put to bed because the consequences are all tied for statistical analysis

416
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,400
and it becomes really clear for these models

417
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,910
if you're in philosophy small and you should use a model like this

418
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,280
this model will be very well determined speaker is large and it's interesting that all

419
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,630
the dimensionality reduction algorithms i've just been presenting are effectively trying to approximate or doing

420
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:55,100
something like that so they are well determined as the number of data features goes

421
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,990
up in fact that's withdrawal example is a nasty example because this peace three

422
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,150
and is three thousand

423
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:08,550
and if you do locally linear embeddings on it if you've ever applied at you

424
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:13,270
have to induce a regularizer if your neighborhood graph goes above the data dimensionality

425
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:18,980
you have to regularize it in this domain where pierce three and is thousand that's

426
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,320
freaky why is that's there your answer

427
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,790
it's the wrong domain

428
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,270
it's not what you should be looking you should be looking at swiss roll and fifty thousand dimensions

429
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,240
nine three

430
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,190
because it's hard to plot

431
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,040
fifty thousand dimensions in the science paper but

432
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,460
that's why they do it

433
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:41,460
so as we increase data points parameters become better determined normally behave as we increase data features the parameters

434
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,540
become better determined this is completely turning a large piece smaland problem on its head

435
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,520
i mean this

436
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,920
you know so it's a blessing and dimensionality but actually what is really saying is

437
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,510
that there is not a characteristic of your data

438
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,210
and it is very characteristic your model how you're using the model

439
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,840
don't fit models which will lead to badly determine parameters

440
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,880
so that's the difference between the two

441
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,220
types and modeling

442
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,340
customer interactive blessing of dimensionality cancer which voting

443
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,940
and this becomes really clear if you work with things like microarray data which is

444
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,780
not always clear which is which is then

445
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:24,190
because sometimes you are interested in different data points being genes

446
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,240
sometimes you

447
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,030
but sometimes using those as being the data features

448
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,280
things are you interested in you know and experiments on the features of the genes

449
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,150
so you can try is just a matter of transposing these matrices and fitting the

450
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,260
other way around a cause it doesn't need some practical consequences in this

451
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,970
model it's very easy to include all predict for a new data point test data point very easy yeah

452
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,940
because it's just independent

453
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,030
and you've got the parameters

454
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,280
in this model it's not easy to predict for a new data point

455
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,760
because you need to compute

456
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,140
pretty simple recursion

457
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,830
and you you you can have some kind of a different approach

458
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,800
if you are the original you can say

459
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,230
well let's look at the binary expansion of the sequence

460
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,800
one is this

461
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,910
two is binary

462
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,840
four hundred

463
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,180
seven is and read

464
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:21,960
and if you

465
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,520
count the number of ones in there

466
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,260
you have

467
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,090
and all number of one of these

468
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,980
you can say well let's carry on let's

469
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,600
keep looking at

470
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:37,000
bigger and bigger binary numbers and just keep the ones that have an odd number

471
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,900
of one

472
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,120
this gives you one two four seven eight

473
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,800
eleven thirteen

474
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,350
it's said that just

475
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,860
as simple

476
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,520
or well you can be

477
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,330
even more

478
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:59,580
torture and look at high in its early years i removed the three rites three

479
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,390
one four one five nine that would be five

480
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,180
and two seven one eight that's would be

481
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,090
and and they say well OK one two four seven so the next one is

482
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,900
why not

483
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,920
and what you

484
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:21,160
well i'm observing one two four seven but i think later on it will keep

485
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,110
at seven and this is my explanation for it

486
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,980
basically you see that you can come up with as many possible expansion of that

487
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,690
sequence as you wish

488
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,730
it you know a matter of

489
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,620
which one do you consider the simplest is there is no notion of simple thing

490
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:44,300
like happened because some people would argue that the binary expansion is natural i computers

491
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,620
would argue that

492
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:50,410
reasonable people might argue that this one is

493
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,920
i mean it's really up to you

494
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:03,000
well some of the example in the same thing if you look at the sequence

495
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,770
i think well OK we said so many numbers there is only one way to

496
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,830
to continue the sequence right you can be sure that

497
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,820
these are all prime to the next one is the prior

498
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:18,200
well again if look into this semantic encyclopedia you can see two answers one is

499
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,470
the next prime

500
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,520
in one is

501
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,910
another is the order of the next simple rules

502
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:29,750
probably don't know what it what is simple or maybe you know

503
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,050
but the are my point is

504
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,170
you know

505
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:39,110
it's a matter of what you're most familiar with you know people are familiar with

506
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:44,910
prime so maybe we can say OK natural continuation of the sequences sixty one

507
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,050
but again

508
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,890
there is no we cannot prove it i cannot say for sure

509
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:55,340
this sequence will continue with sixty one there is no other way

510
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:01,120
another example which gives a little twist on that the

511
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,430
the following

512
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,590
so we observed a sequence of numbers

513
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,840
if it's i mean you

514
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,660
looks random just

515
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,710
but you know if you don't know

516
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:22,190
the specific number that is very popular like if i have given you another less

517
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,820
popular number

518
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,510
you would have said OK that seems to not have been a factor

519
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:34,300
so in and if you look at the frequencies that if you

520
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,810
count how many times each individual member

521
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,790
and you can

522
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,190
i assume that the probability of the next

523
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,870
being i is proportional to many times jobs you have observed is i've divided by

524
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,770
digits observed

525
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,840
this probably you can see that it will converge to

526
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,880
one then is

527
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,790
because what this is

528
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,440
kind of random in the sense that every number can occur

529
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,170
with the same probability

530
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,950
but as you say you noticed

531
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,020
in this really looks like the expansion by

532
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:24,110
so why do we prefer this

533
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,920
and for the last answer

534
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,320
well because we

535
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,810
obviously not is that there is a structure

536
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,000
even though it's not you know you can formalise by

537
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:37,880
some kind of recursion like CU and is equal to the u n minus one

538
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,670
was something

539
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:41,450
but still

540
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,350
we managed to not is that this is

541
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,510
something that their structure and actually there is

542
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:51,050
the reason that the reason that would produce the sequence and continue it so which

543
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:54,810
would so these salaries you can think of it as a model for that sequence

544
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,360
it's it corresponds to these observations and gives you

545
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,820
and expansion

546
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,610
OK now let's rock

547
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,800
is there

548
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,770
in general principle for

549
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:15,850
providing a good answer to these these results write these questions of nineteen twenty well

550
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,840
i mean there is one approach that seems to be

551
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,950
satisfactory which is called these occam's razor

552
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,650
try to find an explanation which is consistent with what you observe and which is

553
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,530
patterns it has two

554
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,860
proceed farther

555
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,340
for shortlisted to just one

556
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,530
for the algorithm has the second step which is the selection

557
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,470
whatever you need to look what do you do

558
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,610
consider this register

559
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:53,510
it can be now considered selection step so in in the first step was that

560
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,680
i have part

561
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,400
no we have all the other musical knowledge that can be used in the second

562
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:05,260
step to list in order of preference the different cases in that case for example

563
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,970
one of the of the patterns is goes up is an update action selection is

564
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,360
that and the other one is down

565
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,130
one of the criteria is the

566
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,200
that direction

567
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,880
the system select preacher

568
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,970
the same night action because the input from those that

569
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,570
after this election

570
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,360
on the bottom

571
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,800
what surprised me was selected because it has the same direction i think problem you

572
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,470
could have used also automatically strength or the traditional formulation actually

573
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:47,780
in in for this particular case in in all these three situation direction durational cumulation

574
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,180
and medical strains in much especially so that gives you even more stronger and stronger

575
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,950
confidence that this is a very good

576
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:00,740
this is very good precedent to solve problem

577
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:04,840
the one on the right is a better compression to solve the problem what you

578
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,400
have that well you have to

579
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,720
most of the most difficult part actually has been done

580
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,610
this is inferring press n

581
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,740
what you have to do now is to use the solution

582
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,050
that means imitate imitate what has been done in the in the in the present

583
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,920
so the precedent cases there is a side that is out that this is the

584
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,180
dynamics with graphical interpretation for to make it easier

585
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:37,010
and the the onset the onset and duration of the note is what is about

586
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:43,150
and articulations of the this the the second of nodes are quite all but the

587
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,760
reason is that between the first and the second terminal this is what i try

588
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:52,470
to i try to represent graphically with this with this with this a few words

589
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:57,070
here so since all this information is that so we have we know

590
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:02,820
how this node has been play along this five expressive dimensions what we do is

591
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,260
to transfer it and we copy that we need that work with some of the

592
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,090
patient obviously

593
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,420
because maybe

594
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:15,510
the average dynamics the average reward to the average articulation is the precedent case

595
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,950
it is different

596
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:21,680
then the dynamic articulation of the of the of the problem

597
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,400
the SMS gives us also composites averages so this has to be a scale it

598
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,590
is factorized right

599
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:33,490
but what is important is that there is this going these these even when the

600
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,030
in the dynamics

601
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:41,090
the first of these is the onset is is dissipated the second one is delayed

602
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
what it means this graphically

603
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,800
and of the not is

604
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,010
nothing has been changed the

605
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:52,860
all these things are then imitated and this is what the system decides to do

606
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:58,090
it could be that after the selection the research in this election there are still

607
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:01,530
more than one precedent that would be applicable

608
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,340
it's not the end of the of the story that it could be still do

609
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:10,360
this unless we we have left more than one possible president we need a good

610
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:14,780
if this is that it is the case well we system provides the possibilities of

611
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,470
making the final decision and to come up with just one

612
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,700
one precedent to imitate

613
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,030
majority minority continuity diversity in we provided by default majority

614
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,880
and in case there is no majority because maybe there are two and both are

615
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:35,260
the provide different things once a siding normal dynamics

616
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,680
and there are only two this time so then we you wish is randomly as

617
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,450
as as a last resort

618
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:49,220
so let's see now some example of of the system how it would work actually

619
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,150
and as a set

620
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,930
we will listen festival

621
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,650
almost in expressive phrase

622
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,400
and then we sit around the ring

623
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,840
a different one is label joyful

624
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,260
all the other labels such

625
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,950
i label them these

626
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,430
because if you notice here that disaffected values right

627
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:15,760
so so that they can save the beginning is that the user can that can

628
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,050
say well i'd like to have a joyful interpretation of this input right well this

629
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:27,180
is relatively easy we have the memory of cases is categorized into in different clusters

630
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,340
and all

631
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,130
these interpretations are performances that are

632
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:37,180
joyful together and cluster one you one cluster in the centre of the cluster the

633
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:43,360
melancholic and another cluster so when you say that you want a joyful into joyful

634
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:49,740
performance of user although we only look for former presidents in the in the joyful

635
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:53,200
cluster consists of source as simple as that

636
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,740
but let's let's let's listen

637
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:20,220
paid attention the long that is a lot of difference after

638
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,220
is not completely in this present because in terms of dynamics is the most difficult

639
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,530
expressive dimension to control freeman performance he could not avoid

640
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:47,920
doing some little crescendos and things like that but for the rest

641
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:51,340
in terms of timing in terms of onsets

642
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,360
if you were you know if you are measuring

643
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:59,180
you not is that the nodes start something where when when they should not not

644
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,260
not not before nineteen ninety after

645
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,740
so far the rest was pretty good and

646
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,320
w but they were not there were no be proud to call especially in the

647
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,610
long notes where terrace ex-player feels more

648
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,850
round of

649
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:19,570
division that looked very much like mitosis where these x structures would be split into

650
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,530
two pieces

651
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:28,570
the notion then their parents would go to singletons and then upon fertilization singletons would

652
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,860
come together to reconstitute a pair

653
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,110
really didn't fit mendel

654
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:40,300
and thus was born the chromosomal theory of inheritance

655
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,490
the chromosomal theory of inheritance

656
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,600
are you overwhelmed by the chromosome theory of inheritance of a given you overwhelming evidence

657
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,050
to believe that

658
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,950
now i

659
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:05,270
seems naturally now but i mean the only evidence is that there's something else that's

660
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:10,490
got pairs in cells right what's what's to say that the some other thing that

661
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:14,290
appears open cells actually is the carrier of genes

662
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:20,050
the chromosome theory of inheritance is that mentals abstract factors genes live on these chromosomes

663
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:25,480
are these chromosomes or something like that carried by these chromosomes and simply the fact

664
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,470
that the choreography the chromosomes

665
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,330
it is not the same as is the same as the choreography of men those

666
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:37,550
genes that correlation infected ex post facto correlation and many prediction that these chromosomes are

667
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,770
doing just sort chromosomes did it and i said OK you know that that could

668
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:49,440
medals observations about genes and there's a world of difference between that could explain

669
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,870
that is consistent with

670
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,510
the data and

671
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,150
that presents a compelling case that this is true

672
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,180
so there are some people immediately bought into the idea

673
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,550
of the chromosomal theory of inheritance and there are other people who remain great skeptics

674
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,490
about this that these chromosomes were

675
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:13,110
themselves quite irrelevant to inheritance and indeed many people who at this point the early

676
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:17,460
twentieth century felt that the whole business of genes was still not such an overwhelming

677
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:22,870
idea anyway and trying to unite these two was going a bit far out so

678
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,320
now i have to bring you back to some of the things that that we

679
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,540
left unresolved last time

680
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:34,340
which is mental second law of inheritance because if we're really going to start

681
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:42,320
building a case that chromosomes really do carry genes then we better get some serious

682
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,750
consistency with much more complex aspects of the theory or we better look for some

683
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,200
contradictions so

684
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,880
your call and i mentioned that

685
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,270
mendel studied

686
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,010
seven different rates two of them around this and green this

687
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:03,970
both dominant phenotypes underlaying by these hypothetical genes

688
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,060
big are big are big big g

689
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,560
and the recessive traits associated

690
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,880
with the same genes wrinkled in yellow

691
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,290
there are little are

692
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,890
a little too little g

693
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,460
when you make a first-generation cross

694
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,400
what do you get

695
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:29,480
you get around in greenfield typically engine typically what are they

696
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,850
big are little are

697
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,710
big g little g

698
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,310
that would be the genotype these organisms would be

699
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,520
that they be double-header i be heterozygous for the gene that controls shape and heterozygous

700
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,680
for the gene to be heterozygous for the gene that controls seed color

701
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,450
now suppose we do across back

702
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,680
so are are gg

703
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:02,340
the parents that is has the recessive phenotype for both of these traits were practising

704
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,350
our words here

705
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,960
what will this parent the second parent

706
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,260
contribute in its garments

707
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:19,370
well again it's from apparently

708
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,520
little are little g they have to be little are little g

709
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:25,290
because that's all it's got off

710
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,450
so little are little g

711
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:34,730
well this pairing contribute

712
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,010
i could give big big g

713
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,590
could give a little are little g

714
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,560
could given principle way

715
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,210
are big g or a

716
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,960
big are little g

717
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,960
in theory any of those are possible

718
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:55,700
what's the ratio that mendel reports

719
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:01,340
one to one to one to want equal that's one to one to one one

720
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:05,070
that's the

721
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,650
independent assortment

722
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:09,870
of traits

723
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,010
that's what he calls this independent assortment of traits

724
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:27,610
that is to say the inheritance around the inheritance of green are uncorrelated to each

725
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:31,080
other right knowing which when you've got around this which when you got green is

726
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,170
they don't convey any information about each other

727
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,820
so how can we explain this in terms of personal theory of inheritance well

728
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,770
we could explain this in terms of the chromosomal theory of inheritance by saying for

729
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,510
example that

730
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,160
in this heterozygous parents here

731
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,060
big are

732
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,350
and little are carried on

733
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:59,460
how we can solve this problem

734
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,940
and we are going to use the same

735
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:02,860
can treat

736
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:08,310
and it would be quite easy you is the formulation without the

737
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,030
six i answer formulation just with the

738
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:15,360
without noise so without the idea of

739
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,410
soft tumour technology

740
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:19,570
of soft margin so it

741
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,030
and here

742
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,110
you see i just replace

743
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:28,740
and the formulation when i see this kind of put between x i and x

744
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,560
j just replaced it

745
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,420
by sick and then

746
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:34,400
the value

747
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,560
of the can then k

748
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:39,450
taken at x i and x two

749
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:42,270
in fact

750
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:48,820
we had we as we we are going to solve this problem of optimally imagine

751
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,240
that plane not

752
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,990
is the original input space but

753
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,860
injured in the feature space

754
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,190
define the some reason camaguey

755
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,140
so of course we have

756
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:10,290
the formulation for instance of w

757
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,210
in the feature space

758
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:18,310
and formulation of w will be in terms of the implicit function phi

759
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:24,570
but never mind you remember that the function or functions solution as the lines from

760
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,040
inside you

761
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,170
again you use enough for that

762
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,690
to compute the

763
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,070
the answer of classifiers

764
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,770
so again maybe here

765
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:42,540
it's even more care remember i tell you that k

766
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:49,110
can it can be seen as specific similarity we have a very nice property of

767
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,150
being a semidefinite because it

768
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,240
in order to classify acts

769
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,880
x you ask to some extent data sources of data

770
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,060
in fact

771
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,450
as you know you are going to see it

772
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:06,060
these data are not

773
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:10,460
in our very placed near

774
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:15,520
just the parish and we're going to make the link with this is the first

775
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:20,440
program and the number one but again you are going to try this is supported

776
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,820
that you have to combine their advice

777
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:27,190
so look again here

778
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:34,600
is the prediction is representation the input space

779
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,500
offshore nonlinear

780
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:38,020
decision function

781
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,610
you've you've found SVM

782
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,080
this is a

783
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,070
the decision function frontier

784
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,280
is this red line is

785
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,770
green line so i'm not sure you

786
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,910
see run here

787
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:56,730
for instance here

788
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,320
and it's you

789
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,860
in fact it is green

790
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,400
the decision function

791
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,880
corresponds to some hyperplane

792
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,540
in into feature space

793
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,410
OK and

794
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:13,080
what feature space i use here

795
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:18,420
i used in fact cautioned him and so in fact i am usually

796
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:20,330
an infinite dimension

797
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,600
feature space

798
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:24,700
and i'm doing as i was working

799
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,240
in this case

800
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,980
in fact i working space but only using this kind of put

801
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,030
so the magic the magic of comments

802
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,480
is the fact that

803
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:40,940
he's very complex

804
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,380
the non-linear decision frontier

805
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,160
is a linear

806
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:49,210
decision function in the future

807
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:57,880
the second point in the city to decision which is important is that the place

808
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,710
of the support vectors

809
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,830
you can see this about the picture

810
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:06,530
this idea is wrong

811
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:07,980
runs across

812
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,250
was a brief

813
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:17,840
so we're going to talk today about

814
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,310
binary search trees

815
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:25,780
something called randomly built binary search tree

816
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:42,570
don't really a binary search trees is BS through the lecture and you all

817
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:47,300
scene binary search trees in one place to another in particular recitation on friday

818
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,090
so we're going to build up

819
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,670
the basic ideas

820
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,850
presented there

821
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,140
and this

822
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:56,050
talk about how to randomize them and make them good

823
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,180
so you know

824
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,210
but there are

825
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,980
good binary search trees

826
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:02,460
which are relatively balanced

827
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,810
something like this

828
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,450
behind is log and we call them balanced

829
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,430
and that's

830
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,140
anything order log will be fine

831
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,150
in terms of searching for then cost or log n

832
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:19,140
and there are bad binary search trees which have really

833
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,250
large high possibly

834
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:22,680
because and

835
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:27,330
so this is good

836
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:31,060
this is bad we sort of like to know we'd like to build binary searches

837
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,690
in such a way that they're good all the time or these most of the

838
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,770
there are lots of ways to do this and the next couple of weeks we

839
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:45,560
four of them if you count the problem set believe

840
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:47,630
today we're going to

841
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,610
can use randomisation to make them balanced most of the time in a certain sense

842
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:57,260
and then in your problem so you make that in a broader sense

843
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,440
one way to do this topic so define randomly built binary search for

844
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:09,500
one way to motivate the topic is through sort our good friend

845
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:12,100
so there's a natural way to sort

846
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:14,870
and the numbers using binary search trees

847
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,270
give you an array a how would you sort

848
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,700
that array

849
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,170
using binary search tree operations the black box

850
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:31,580
build the binary search tree and then to a or exactly

851
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,220
we have some initial training

852
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:36,420
which is empty

853
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,720
and then for each element of the array

854
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:45,210
inserted into the tree

855
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,970
i that by building the search

856
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:56,650
so we insert a i'm going to treat this is the binary search tree insertion

857
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,120
standard sessions

858
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,030
and then we do an inorder traversal

859
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,310
she in the book is called an ordered tree walk

860
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:16,190
you should know what is out of the car

861
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,820
but just for very quick reminder

862
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:24,020
three insert walk is basically searches for that element AI until it finds the place

863
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,650
where it should have been if it was in the tree already

864
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,680
and then it as a new leaf there

865
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:31,680
to insert that value tree walk

866
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:36,810
recursively walks the left subtree then prince out the roots and then recursively walks the

867
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:40,720
right subtree and by the binary search tree property that will present the elements out

868
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,090
in sorted order

869
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:44,670
so let's do a quick example

870
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:49,500
because this turns out to be related to another sorting algorithm we've seen already

871
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,740
so while the example

872
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:53,690
pretty trivial

873
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,720
the connection is pretty surprising based

874
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:00,060
it was to me for some this class

875
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,000
so my array

876
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,480
three one eight

877
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,490
two six seven

878
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:19,660
and i'm going to visit these elements in order from left to right and build

879
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,520
the tree

880
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,760
the first cell i see is three

881
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:23,930
so i

882
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,860
in insert three into an empty tree that requires no comparisons

883
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,790
when i insert one

884
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:33,600
two just naively work with the best one and that actually if you think about

885
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,550
it for well that's actually a special case of overfitting

886
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,590
so what this algorithm is doing is trying to

887
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:44,070
trying to keep the intuition of going with the functions that have done better

888
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,180
in the past but it's not going to just go with the best function it's

889
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,570
going to kind smoothly

890
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:53,270
move towards the best function without putting all of its weight on the best functions

891
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,160
so how do we analyse the

892
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:02,120
the number of areas of this simple algorithm

893
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:06,480
but every time this algorithm makes a mistake every time this weighted majority prime algorithm

894
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,130
makes a mistake

895
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:11,550
so we had a majority of the functions

896
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:15,130
we're on the majority of the weight was wrong

897
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:17,700
more than half of our way was wrong it will be have to be cut

898
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,470
in half

899
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:23,090
so we will decrease are total weight by these twenty five percent

900
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,530
so the final total weight

901
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,930
at the end of the day is if we've made a a certain number of

902
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,000
then are weights which started as if they were functions went down by three quarters

903
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,210
each time

904
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:41,300
are we will be no more than five times three quarters to this number might

905
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,890
be much less depending on how many people mistake made mistake each time

906
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,300
on the other hand

907
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:51,180
on the positive side a total we cannot be too small

908
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:55,020
in particular total weight is just the sum of the weights of each

909
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:55,880
of the

910
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:00,540
and they started one and they got cut in half the time they made mistake

911
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:03,970
and we know there's one function we hope there's one function that did well this

912
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:07,590
comparing ourselves to the one function in made the fewest number of mistakes so if

913
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:11,120
there's one function of there that whatever it is that makes the fewest mistakes

914
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:13,020
its weight is at most

915
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:17,050
this quantity to to the minus the number of mistakes made

916
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:20,700
and when you take these two terms and put them together

917
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,970
so it so this is bigger than this

918
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:28,320
what you get out when you take logarithms used a log here you have like

919
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:34,130
it comes down and a lot of three-quarters times mistakes

920
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:38,140
what you get you can work it out yourself and you can see here is

921
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:43,260
the number of mistakes will make is is not too much more than the number

922
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,930
of mistakes of the best function this is not agree guarantee

923
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:50,570
saying he making almost twice the number of mistakes of the function

924
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:53,990
this is the best guy i had an error rate of ten percent will have

925
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:58,100
an error rate of twenty four percent which is not very satisfying

926
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,430
but still you know interesting it in a simple algorithm

927
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:04,210
so what is the

928
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,750
right algorithm to use here what's nice

929
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:08,280
a better guarantee

930
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:12,270
you can modify this algorithm it it turns out that that that cutting the weights

931
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:15,720
in half with a little bit too steep and we should have just

932
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:18,600
not the way it's done by a little bit so

933
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,630
i think this is upset that we should have knocked on the weights by one

934
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:27,040
and this should be the square root of sum log f over n

935
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:31,460
some terms which is less than one and we want to

936
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,570
decrease the weights by that time and then you will get to guarantee

937
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:39,500
that the expected performance there's no no longer perspective to now you have effective one

938
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:44,060
plus a second term the number of mistakes is no more than the mistakes of

939
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,970
the best function

940
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:48,310
plus the second term and so

941
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,000
what you get is that actually

942
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:53,260
the regret which is the difference of how well how well we did on our

943
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,900
data compared to what we could have done

944
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:57,450
is this term here which is going to zero

945
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,080
quite quickly

946
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,530
in fact that's exactly the same term

947
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:04,150
we had for the case when

948
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,380
when the data wasn't coming online right

949
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,070
this is that one when we had to go back

950
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,730
so the

951
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:15,740
that's member this is what we got over here

952
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:18,880
so in this case what is what we got over here we have the same

953
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,300
same term here

954
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:22,490
up to constant factor here

955
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:26,570
and this constant is not constant in front of our progress is not if is

956
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:30,150
the best may ten percent were made making twenty percent this saying the best may

957
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:34,570
ten plus ten percent were making ten plus epsilon

958
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:39,450
or two epsilon mistakes so really it seems like

959
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:42,970
it's not clear that you really need to have this distribution assumption that you really

960
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:46,650
need to do is coming from distribution it might just be coming at you

961
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,700
from some

962
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,990
arbitrary order arbitrary data and still somehow

963
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,790
able to do the same this kind of very surprising things

964
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:59,750
that people in online algorithms in online learning have been noticed is that you get

965
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:02,320
pretty much the same kind of guarantees

966
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:06,330
when you're in in the online setting in the batch

967
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:11,540
and questions

968
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,050
let me tell you some other cool things you can do with this weighted majority

969
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,880
you might say well

970
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,970
what if the world is changing over time i mean you're making this nice assumption

971
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:26,950
that you are not assuming that the data is coming from some distribution the data

972
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:28,240
could be changing over time

973
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,760
but still

974
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:33,610
you only comparing itself to the best single function in hindsight

975
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:35,130
it is not a little unfair

976
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,730
would you want to do as well as the best

977
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:40,090
changing function

978
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:41,360
OK so

979
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:43,220
you might compare itself to the best

980
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:45,350
in fact in one nice thing you can do is you can compare you can

981
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:47,090
take a window of the sun with

982
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:50,550
OK to take a window w and that it has with

983
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:55,570
the length of w with w

984
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:58,750
then what you what you look at you can modify the algorithm so that you

985
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:03,220
get a very similar guarantee but you get this guarantee every window on every window

986
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,400
with w then almost as well as the best function in that cluster it on

987
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,640
that one

988
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,610
so now i really adapting to

989
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,400
changing things of course if you make that we know very small if you make

990
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,740
window one then you not just comparing yourself to the

991
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:20,070
best function on

992
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,010
every single example

993
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,580
and you can get very good guarantees

994
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,820
any questions

995
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,840
let me just explain a little more so when you compare itself to the best

996
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,530
when you when you said w call one comparing itself to the guy who got

997
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,340
everything right and

998
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:42,990
i have to do work on stock market for start with what people want to

999
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:46,300
know why can't i compare myself to the best stock every day why do i

1000
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,490
in order to do this

1001
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:49,140
i would need to

1002
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:50,890
to have those recipes

1003
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:54,760
somehow in an electronic form online

1004
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:58,320
how should i do this

1005
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,220
i don't quite have the time

1006
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,870
two to do this but

1007
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:04,500
the first model

1008
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,400
she's retired so

1009
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,320
she should by definition have a lot of time

1010
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:12,650
the problem is she's not very interesting computers

1011
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,930
she would need

1012
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:18,120
something to

1013
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,120
what i think is it

1014
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:23,300
that you can understand time

1015
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,700
so this is a recipe

1016
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:29,920
four a

1017
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,070
stop it is made of

1018
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,050
you can rise

1019
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,030
and the

1020
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,450
we can agree

1021
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,880
on the former here

1022
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,820
it is understandable to her it understandable to me

1023
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:48,830
for being the domain expert here

1024
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:50,170
how to

1025
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,120
that we

1026
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:53,180
came to

1027
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:55,640
to terms with four months

1028
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,140
how to actually

1029
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:59,090
implement the

1030
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:04,040
because only have twenty minutes i i decided that i should go too

1031
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,560
as you go away there

1032
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:06,950
in until yourself

1033
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:08,900
and i chose ruby

1034
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:13,420
because it is a expression expressive language

1035
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:15,040
these proposals

1036
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:17,020
it is not particularly good

1037
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:20,280
but as i said only have twenty minutes

1038
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,100
i have several methods

1039
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,380
which received

1040
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,920
by the end

1041
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:37,290
ingredients here

1042
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:43,290
actually of type hash or met in some languages

1043
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:48,420
i've seen i've noticed the similarity here

1044
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,090
but should

1045
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:55,880
i also have units likely to end

1046
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:58,550
often those methods on

1047
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:03,460
on numbers here

1048
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,510
this one is a slightly different

1049
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,940
to write a recipe

1050
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,290
as you can see we don't

1051
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,710
however that hash anymore

1052
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:15,940
now we have a block of code

1053
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,940
the block of code is executed

1054
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,490
some time later

1055
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,650
and his

1056
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,450
methods that are

1057
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:25,920
the time

1058
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,320
actually ingredients

1059
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:30,640
and all those methods don't even have to exist

1060
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,750
we can just intersect

1061
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:36,450
method missing for example

1062
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,530
say that

1063
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,900
if intercept that

1064
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:44,150
then it is a ingredients

1065
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:50,930
much of that

1066
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:55,670
that's what they just said that is actually about programming

1067
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,720
way too

1068
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:00,830
to change the cold while run while the program is right

1069
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:06,030
ruby is not the only expressive language

1070
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,850
i'm sure that something similar could be done for

1071
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:14,170
as i've seen those nice in example six operators

1072
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:18,760
for example this is

1073
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:20,100
examples from

1074
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,960
using groovy is a

1075
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:26,630
programming language which incidentally runs on the JVM

1076
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:29,640
we are we have a cash again

1077
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:31,750
this time is in there

1078
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,200
and the syntax is even though it's say a

1079
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:39,920
then the one in new

1080
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:43,920
now that two

1081
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:48,460
i decided on a four-month and how it will look like

1082
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:53,370
it is time to choose how shall we implement that

1083
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:55,190
there are several techniques

1084
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,170
in ruby

1085
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:00,030
it makes depend on language shows

1086
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:04,340
first technique is

1087
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:06,680
well pretty basic one

1088
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,540
it can be

1089
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,350
replicated so

1090
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,130
i suppose any language

1091
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:15,740
i just implement

1092
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,230
methods on an object

1093
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,720
and that's a project dot

1094
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,940
recipe object

1095
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,640
but it's not not really

1096
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,400
nice one

1097
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:30,030
i mean

1098
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,860
it has this

1099
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,680
o thing in front of it

1100
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:35,740
that is

1101
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,330
out of place if

1102
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,280
the men expertise using not program

1103
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:48,610
o making it best-selling ruby

1104
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:50,630
is to use

1105
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:56,310
study or class methods of base class

1106
01:04:56,350 --> 01:05:00,350
we've seen it before

1107
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,830
and here they are

1108
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,770
belongs to has many

1109
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:07,970
those are

1110
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:12,230
static methods of a class a to record

1111
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:19,710
and if it's quite nicely here

1112
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,200
another method is to

1113
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:29,200
consistency theorem for locally weighted average classifiers actually baggage one nearest neighbour classifier

1114
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:34,640
a weighted nearest neighbour classifiers and we can take away

1115
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,890
of this far

1116
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:38,820
we come about

1117
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:45,280
actually i'm going to give thanks to god just storms this was the which is

1118
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:50,820
is always join size is sufficient for while

1119
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,660
OK wonder if be

1120
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:55,140
we cannot accept

1121
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:57,870
when she waits

1122
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:02,440
what we have to prove consistency is just to verify the condition of the urine

1123
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,500
conditions during the true

1124
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:13,140
that the that one classifier because it it because you think

1125
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,940
but then as you suggest

1126
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:17,250
seven minutes ago

1127
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:20,080
this is not original others brand

1128
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:24,950
if you download the software of course there are many different ideas which are

1129
01:06:24,970 --> 01:06:28,440
but the software key idea

1130
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,680
different important i the key had the way we get

1131
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:36,900
so remember this was my original from observation mission church

1132
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:37,840
so o

1133
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:41,580
what would you like to show white

1134
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:47,650
i could actually deviation from the

1135
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:52,330
instead of choosing according to separate from the other

1136
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,770
i do concentrate direction with

1137
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,410
point i just got this

1138
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:01,110
i can see

1139
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,770
you could run like

1140
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:08,090
of well of course they don't say anything about the way cut you can get

1141
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:09,910
it right you can use some more

1142
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,420
we could by

1143
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:14,510
g argument so i mean square

1144
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,280
what you can do it the direction where

1145
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:22,930
the point along

1146
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:26,280
the company of few observations

1147
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:31,280
point itself or the intention to make an arbitrary decision

1148
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:36,230
once you've got to get to the point of this

1149
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:38,400
he said the call all of the set

1150
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:39,840
this is

1151
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,550
and of course

1152
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,960
you see that this is very different from what it was before

1153
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:47,920
because that the number of seventy of

1154
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:52,840
completely arbitrary may change from one tree to another this is very different

1155
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,270
this is the original

1156
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:56,880
algorithm which have been proposed by the much

1157
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:01,440
i want to go truck

1158
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,900
one track is

1159
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:16,370
of course you can also it for regression is exactly the same progression

1160
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:20,700
in addition decide what just forty seven to

1161
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:24,990
now the question is can we know that this is very interesting question because it's

1162
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:26,440
not so simple at all

1163
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:29,680
the way we have analysed the previous reason which is

1164
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,500
some of the tree

1165
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:35,630
it's completely different partition is not specific to this

1166
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:41,370
number of these which can be specific for it's completely different geometry

1167
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:45,830
the first question what are the important point going for what what

1168
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,700
i understand that you want to do the role

1169
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:52,010
i mean we feel that the channel around

1170
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,250
one place in the world

1171
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:58,430
what are the points which are important point

1172
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:02,510
this one

1173
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:05,660
so this is the most important for that reason

1174
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:08,190
first of all for

1175
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,850
now the question what is the geometrical properties for

1176
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,690
interesting about it

1177
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:16,210
you see that this one of parameters property

1178
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:18,700
that that you draw rector between

1179
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,040
see that of the

1180
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,150
one have the same property

1181
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:28,810
before we it to sixty

1182
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:33,200
draw the for example

1183
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:36,130
and of course much choose there's someone

1184
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:41,280
so that means that the reason just defined some kind of similar to form

1185
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,930
which has nothing to do with

1186
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,140
was going

1187
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,100
so far away

1188
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:50,830
the can point clothes from this point

1189
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:56,000
and the reason just concentrate on some interesting one charge

1190
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:59,280
fred around the time point

1191
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:04,390
here and so define some kind of cannon some kind of identity true identity

1192
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:07,210
now the question is what want

1193
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,440
and the fact that these points have been

1194
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,490
so far

1195
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,240
so what

1196
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,870
been discovered by

1197
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:18,870
true talent six and brown was really exciting to know

1198
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,030
this point

1199
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:23,500
that is called the

1200
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:27,850
a layer nearest neighbour what's

1201
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:32,040
so now the question is what can we say well this one

1202
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:35,430
this year there

1203
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:39,510
just some observations observations

1204
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:43,310
you were point

1205
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,420
the body

1206
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:51,290
of course said that the number of responses

1207
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,260
this is of course not one

1208
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,790
one than

1209
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:58,910
number one is not always the same

1210
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:02,360
the first question is known about this one

1211
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:06,330
it turned out that a lot is known about here

1212
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:10,780
when the sample uniformly distributed over o one

1213
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:14,100
lot is known for a period of one

1214
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:18,580
so for example is known that the expected number of responses about again

1215
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:20,600
you might want

1216
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,960
it's just

1217
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,750
accounts for quadrants around important

1218
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,400
you have some right of consistency property of system

1219
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,940
so if you're in the violence nonsense many results on the

1220
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:39,210
actually just because this is connected with the problem of searching for

1221
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,540
the effect of the non since

1222
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,900
so that's used but it's not really

1223
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:50,360
because this is true only for uniform distribution for uniform one

1224
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,780
should think

1225
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:55,720
this is kind of binary relation

1226
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:59,350
now show observation which i say this is thing

1227
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:01,990
results are the

1228
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:05,620
company for the reporting this and that you can use any you kind

1229
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:08,350
trio triple the case when see

1230
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,100
the first thing we had to do was to understand

1231
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:14,240
how disappointed when you

1232
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:16,300
so this is a real number

1233
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:18,010
what we have known

1234
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:19,410
music march

1235
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:22,950
so suppose we have an observation which are independent of according to the

1236
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:25,860
improve what can we say about

1237
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:29,940
we have proven these two results

1238
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:34,990
which are essentially realizes proof decision geometry

1239
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:39,030
definitely not a colony of

1240
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:41,720
from the number of

1241
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:44,900
because you can provide without assumptions

1242
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:56,730
moreover should suppose that this is what we're that they have some kind of

1243
01:12:56,810 --> 01:13:00,970
the following one

1244
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:04,110
and these results are just

1245
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:08,750
the result over the the the results are simple we can use them to understand

1246
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:11,260
the way first before

1247
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:15,440
before we jump to run the first of course give i i

1248
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:16,830
an interesting

1249
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:19,230
which is

1250
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:20,120
and then

1251
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,430
regression testing it

1252
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:22,970
one of get

1253
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:26,260
can just take the average of all y

1254
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,010
which are the nearest neighbor

1255
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:30,410
in the sense of the scope of this true

1256
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:32,580
e two

1257
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:58,240
the a of

1258
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:49,600
you may

1259
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:53,920
all the time

1260
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:34,820
on whole

1261
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:53,130
o right

1262
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:57,090
so we have a qualitative and quantitative one chinese we have is how to combine

1263
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:58,400
the findings

1264
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:01,370
OK i you combine the qualitative information quantum information

1265
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:05,360
you may have a combination with the quantitative informations from a large sample

1266
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:09,060
the qualitative from small sample so how to combine them

1267
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:12,160
so we talk about interpretive consistency making sure

1268
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:16,870
that the information that you combine with the from the quantitative and qualitative consistent

1269
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:20,190
given your sample size is in this phase

1270
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,770
and some of these when you look at the box when you look at these

1271
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:24,980
issues i books

1272
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:31,140
typically will associate that something quantitative of qualitative one things we like to do is

1273
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,040
mixed methods research say when i mean

1274
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:34,520
you could do any of these

1275
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:36,330
you got you design

1276
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:38,150
OK with this kind hard

1277
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:39,730
so there's least twenty four

1278
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:42,230
types of sampling schemes

1279
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:46,380
again look for the will clark et al

1280
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:48,400
not clear that will

1281
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:49,850
have all these in

1282
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:52,170
the the first five around them

1283
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:57,000
which quite a while with the third of simple random sampling stratified easily

1284
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:59,210
cluster sampling systematic

1285
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:00,830
and then

1286
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,480
others are

1287
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:04,770
what's called purposes

1288
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:06,310
none rand

1289
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:08,880
so example maximum variation

1290
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:11,960
is where you might choose people

1291
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:16,230
such that there is wide possible there as diverse as possible BW

1292
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:20,920
any kind of you know cointreau anything when sampling process use your own

1293
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:24,250
you have many other types

1294
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:26,250
there you see

1295
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:29,880
and including politically sensitive sampling

1296
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,190
this is an important

1297
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:35,560
when and where you might choose someone because of their

1298
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:36,230
you know

1299
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:38,690
essentially there are

1300
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:41,790
the expectation that they have information that you need

1301
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:45,150
in a position of power for example

1302
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:49,730
another important situation is

1303
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:51,770
sample size

1304
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:53,900
that's really important i see so many

1305
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:57,000
study some especially dissertations

1306
01:24:57,020 --> 01:25:00,110
questions may have too small a sample size

1307
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:01,960
to be able to

1308
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:02,770
you know

1309
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:03,400
i have

1310
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:07,420
article power to detect difference or relationship with this one really there

1311
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:10,400
so it's really important that when we do quantitative study

1312
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:12,960
all makes mistakes as the qualitative component

1313
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:16,420
that we pay attention to the issue of statistical power

1314
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:19,330
there are some guidelines there

1315
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:22,290
for example if the college's study

1316
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:24,250
you need sixty four

1317
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:30,630
participants for a one hypotheses and eighty two for two tailed and so forth

1318
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:35,290
as there some the funds and then i one further recommend that have no affiliation

1319
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:36,040
with it

1320
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:39,670
it's called so you may have to keep our energy power

1321
01:25:39,690 --> 01:25:43,520
g p o w e r if you do a google

1322
01:25:43,670 --> 01:25:47,150
search engine to find that you could get a free download

1323
01:25:47,150 --> 01:25:51,830
and some once you have to pay for so that's why would i

1324
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:55,460
i recommend keep out for those who don't spend money on it

1325
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:59,420
and that is really nice put in the there was you need information you need

1326
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,860
to spit out the

1327
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:03,670
sample size that you need

1328
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:06,580
if qualitative some quick and dirty

1329
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:11,170
the numbers of people looked to over the years so for example if you doing

1330
01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:14,940
the case study christian recommend three to five and so forth

1331
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:18,270
most studies now coming out

1332
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:22,460
we actually look at sample size in qualitative research

1333
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:25,610
and that's one came out in film methods couple of years ago

1334
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:28,380
by guest all with a looked at

1335
01:26:30,230 --> 01:26:32,110
the so was about AIDS in africa

1336
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:34,900
and really big sample size is one hundred

1337
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,810
typical quality with a start code data

1338
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:41,310
found that after twelve study after twelve

1339
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:45,750
the data starting repeat themselves he had saturation

1340
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:47,380
they found twelve

1341
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:48,630
maybe a number

1342
01:26:49,630 --> 01:26:53,580
quite quite significant in qualitative research getting saturation

1343
01:26:53,770 --> 01:27:09,940
job place

1344
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:16,810
as a question is asking

1345
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:18,880
it could be in terms of your fatigue

1346
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:22,880
you can you you start to you know especially if you don't want to take

1347
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,520
it was the case you start start to

1348
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:30,150
i get tired and so some of the other things we look for the

1349
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,480
information you know as

1350
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:37,810
you know you know fresh to look at that that's that's why because my mind

1351
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:43,500
in that case if you found that you have

1352
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:47,360
don't quite students have analyse all of them

1353
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:50,290
so you might want to look and see if there were of equal quality that

1354
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:53,060
you think that you might want to use all them if they're not

1355
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:56,460
you could take you could take a selection of them

1356
01:27:56,810 --> 01:28:01,040
so yes so that would be my main answer to that you question

1357
01:28:01,090 --> 01:28:03,580
OK you have questions

1358
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:04,480
OK so

1359
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:09,750
way when quantitative or qualitative samples concise configuration is important

1360
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:13,040
so if you see that this place

1361
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:17,000
you get to get partial credit i would say no in that situation

1362
01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:21,560
so was designed looks like that initiation tito's grew up

1363
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:24,150
but if you those unfortunately

1364
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:31,880
OK when you have to remember again in in mixed methods you can have least

1365
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:35,770
one quantitative phase one qualitative phase

1366
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:40,190
so when you combine together it gets much more complex

1367
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:44,080
and if you just to the modern method because you have to take into account

1368
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:47,690
not only each individual sampling considerations but the

1369
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:49,440
comm combination

1370
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,190
so we came up with a

1371
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:53,560
the one typology

1372
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:57,270
we identified two major things that you need to consider

1373
01:28:57,310 --> 01:28:58,540
when you something

1374
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:01,880
one way you don't have a concurrency with we can collect the data the same

1375
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:05,750
that wants to inform the other

1376
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:08,270
and second if sequential

1377
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:11,150
you see that there

1378
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:13,480
and then you have the dominance which once dominated

1379
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:18,310
and then you have the relationship

1380
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:20,810
identified four types relationships

1381
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:23,020
the first type is identical

1382
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:27,130
with the quantitative and qualitative phases have the same people

1383
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:30,790
so they contribute to both the qualitative and quantitative information

1384
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:32,650
you might give a survey

1385
01:29:32,650 --> 01:29:34,540
there has

1386
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:37,520
opening and closing the questions the same people

1387
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,630
or you might

1388
01:29:38,650 --> 01:29:39,580
i have some

1389
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:41,380
some quite a face

1390
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,750
followed by interviews focus groups where everybody is quite a face

1391
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:47,230
also participate in the qualitative phase

1392
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:51,360
it's is where you have the same type of people

1393
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,560
so if we look at politicians in england

1394
01:29:57,540 --> 01:30:00,230
the different people in different phases

1395
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:03,550
so that you know a group of people i in the quite a face in

1396
01:30:03,550 --> 01:30:06,580
a different group of people the qualitative phase but that all politicians all the same

1397
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,400
it's is where

1398
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:14,110
you have

1399
01:30:14,110 --> 01:30:15,590
scrap anything

1400
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:18,220
and sacrifice since

1401
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:23,860
might not be thank you solely the paper instead of the

1402
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:29,260
OK so let's let's

1403
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,570
look at the simplest graphs with cycles

1404
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:34,320
because we can get intuition from him

1405
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:37,740
it's about three nodes

1406
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,160
that sort of think that

1407
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:43,220
i set some marginal distributions

1408
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:47,400
so mu one x one i'm abusing notation a little bit but we think about

1409
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:48,880
it like vector

1410
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:52,070
so i'm set my marginals to be have have

1411
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:56,820
no one is to binary problem node one is equally likely to care about whether

1412
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:00,510
either one

1413
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:03,380
the same thing for node two

1414
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,930
we'll do the same thing for no three

1415
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:07,590
OK so

1416
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:11,550
the marginals are somehow easy they're boring

1417
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:14,930
now let me send set some joint distributions

1418
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:19,320
so on the edge and have matrix and also to be put some numbers and

1419
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,570
year output

1420
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:22,680
o point four

1421
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,160
o point four

1422
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:30,110
o point one point one

1423
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:31,430
is that a valid choice

1424
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:34,700
what i've done so far

1425
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:38,430
and and why is it valid just so we're on the same page

1426
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:45,240
right so by some point four point one point five the rows and columns both

1427
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:48,410
so so that's good so far

1428
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:52,220
up with the same thing on this edge

1429
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:53,610
so on

1430
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:54,260
for me

1431
01:31:54,340 --> 01:32:03,180
user pen that works on two three all do the same thing

1432
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:05,110
o point four point four

1433
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:06,990
o point one point one

1434
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:08,030
and so

1435
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,950
everybody still happy

1436
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:15,010
now the last edges the interesting edge of course try because that's the only thing

1437
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:19,430
that distinguishes us from if we're on a tree and the last edge all do

1438
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:27,530
a bit more interesting

1439
01:32:27,530 --> 01:32:34,200
in this right and then all uncover is trying to make a mess

1440
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:50,010
so last enjoyed the same thing except that put the point ones on the diagonal

1441
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:56,990
right so locally if i just think about it as the tree

1442
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:59,820
and local sense everybody still happy because

1443
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:04,260
everything's set up so all the row and column sums are have

1444
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:07,220
but if you sort of think physically about this problem you should be bothered by

1445
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:10,570
so let's let's sort of think

1446
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:14,510
whether this makes sense if you sort of thing can you have a set of

1447
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:24,090
random variables binary things that satisfy this kind of behavior doesn't make sense or not

1448
01:33:24,110 --> 01:33:30,110
one way to think about this think of these as people think about them that

1449
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:31,970
you know people have opinions

1450
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:36,860
and maybe the voting on something and if they say yes to something one if

1451
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:38,970
they say no it's zero

1452
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:43,070
right so if we think of it that way then what this means

1453
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:47,200
is that eighty percent of the time whoever is that no one agrees with whoever

1454
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,160
is node three

1455
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:50,380
eighty percent of the time they

1456
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:52,090
have the same opinion

1457
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:57,050
we use that interpretation what's what's funnier

1458
01:33:57,070 --> 01:34:07,570
right so the funny thing is when you go around the cycle one agrees with

1459
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:10,470
three eighty percent of the time

1460
01:34:10,530 --> 01:34:14,720
two agrees with three eighty percent of the time

1461
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:17,430
but somehow one and two

1462
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:22,340
i disagree eighty percent of the time they only agree twenty percent of the time

1463
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:25,570
right so it looks a bit suspicious it sort of there's this maxim friend of

1464
01:34:25,570 --> 01:34:27,720
a friend is your friend kind of thing or

1465
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:30,950
what is the enemy of enemy is your friend

1466
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:34,930
well there is that two this is friend of a friend of a friend which

1467
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:37,910
may or may not be true i don't know about you but only when it

1468
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:41,300
comes to the green this is mathematically impossible

1469
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:45,950
this little exercise you might want to play around with it it's just not possible

1470
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:47,430
to build the distribution

1471
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:53,180
over three binary variables such that this pair is eighty percent agreeing this pairs eighty

1472
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:58,220
percent agreeing and despairs only twenty percent agreeing that's not possible

1473
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:01,740
so this is sort of an instance that when we moved to trees

1474
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,110
when we move away from trees

1475
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:11,720
something goes wrong right this is an example of the vector that sort of locally

1476
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,510
happy it satisfies all of those strains

1477
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:18,180
but it doesn't make any sense globally

1478
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:22,070
so what it means is that the reduction that i did if you only put

1479
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:26,260
those constraints that wouldn't be an exact reduction anymore

1480
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:30,910
because i should have had things that came from some global distribution q

1481
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:33,570
and they should be consistent globally

1482
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:38,720
but these guys are locally consistent not globally

1483
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:45,800
and that's if you think about that well what this statement here saying this deep

1484
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:50,700
fact is that these kinds of games are only possible if you have cycles

1485
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:54,700
if i didn't have cycles of any one of those edges was raised then everybody

1486
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:57,180
is happy it doesn't matter

1487
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:01,380
so that's what that statement saying saying well both the trees are exact but a

1488
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:04,700
sort of extension of it is that for any graph that has cycles

1489
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:09,050
there are vectors that are locally happy but not globally happy

1490
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:16,820
OK so

1491
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:22,860
what we've seen so far what i've told you is that if you run the

1492
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:27,430
max product algorithm on a tree what it's actually doing is solving a linear programme

1493
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:34,010
and the message is that we've spoken about those actually have a concrete interpretation is

1494
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:36,240
lagrange multipliers

1495
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,910
should understand

1496
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:41,600
and now we have a mixed terms

1497
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:46,220
this thing with this and actually we have this twice because this

1498
01:36:46,230 --> 01:36:51,550
combined with this will give us the same thing so just try to

1499
01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:56,490
this thing

1500
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:02,200
and here we have five x i five x

1501
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,180
the mistakes of

1502
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:14,290
and then we've got this basically the same thing now with the difference that here

1503
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:19,750
we have a plus one and here we have an plus song and of course

1504
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:23,770
there's a minus you in different so it seems

1505
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:43,030
you we must

1506
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:54,310
is very soothing sound

1507
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:59,550
it reminds me about of mathematics classes at university so

1508
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:02,490
OK so this is this one

1509
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:03,760
goes away

1510
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:07,550
and then we are left with something that doesn't depend on x

1511
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:11,510
is this thing here is something that does depend on x

1512
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:15,500
and let's see if we're already there

1513
01:38:19,550 --> 01:38:25,450
OK so one difference is the factor of two but of which

1514
01:38:25,490 --> 01:38:31,870
the factor of two we can just take off because sign function and so we

1515
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:36,540
can multiply the argument of the sine function with any nonnegative number that we like

1516
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:39,710
without changing things so so let's just

1517
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:44,380
divide by two

1518
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:47,840
which brings us this thing here

1519
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:51,820
and then we recognise OK this

1520
01:38:51,830 --> 01:38:55,750
these two together they should give us our factor

1521
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,900
b down here

1522
01:38:57,930 --> 01:39:01,480
and the other to the left should exactly give us

1523
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:06,460
so i've called this and instead of them but not exactly give us this quantity

1524
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:12,260
so we've got his first two terms we've got to be

1525
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:14,230
will set

1526
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:16,320
any questions

1527
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:22,580
OK so i have to apologize for those who find this trivial but i think

1528
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:27,700
it's very useful to try to do something because it's you know we to say

1529
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:33,540
this is one simple example of how to analyse algorithms we take the logarithm this

1530
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:37,540
trivial algorithm computing the means in feature spaces and then you can get this difference

1531
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:40,730
between this with distances and you already have a classification algorithms

1532
01:39:40,730 --> 01:39:47,230
it's just something that makes sense from statistical

1533
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:48,420
OK so

1534
01:39:49,570 --> 01:39:54,800
i want to make sure is only four hours i will talk about statistical learning

1535
01:39:54,800 --> 01:40:00,210
theory intellectual control taylor we talk about this in great detail normally at this point

1536
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:06,400
lecture i have a couple of hours about statistical learning theory so i'll ask you

1537
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:11,440
is that same to more about kernels

1538
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:16,840
c so that

1539
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:22,870
let me let me give you some examples

1540
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:25,550
off kind of

1541
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:33,820
the weight one introduces non polynomial what people call polynomial kernel functions

1542
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:38,440
so so so so maybe forget everything that said so far and i will do

1543
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:39,930
things the other way around

1544
01:40:39,930 --> 01:40:46,030
so let's assume we have some two-dimensional

1545
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:47,940
we have some two dimensional inputs

1546
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:52,640
and we have two class classification problem and suppose the problem is such that the

1547
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:56,230
true decision boundaries this ellipse here

1548
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:58,600
so we have some

1549
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:02,070
the red class inside the blue class outside we only given the training points but

1550
01:41:02,070 --> 01:41:06,180
not these this decision boundary which is the ellipse

1551
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:11,950
now suppose we first preprocess all data points mapping into the feature space into a

1552
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:17,650
three dimensional feature space with his prescription prescription here so the description is we compute

1553
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:19,220
all possible products

1554
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:23,780
of two input coordinates in this case this just three possible such

1555
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:28,650
three such products is x one square next to square the next one time six

1556
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:32,300
actually let me put square root of two in front of the

1557
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:36,190
if we do this

1558
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:38,220
making three-dimensional problems

1559
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:41,880
but the three dimensional problem in a certain sense is easier now

1560
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:49,050
it turns out the three-dimensional problem can be solved with a linear decision decision rules

1561
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:53,800
so why is that so if we think about it the first alternate

1562
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:59,810
because that one is exquisite the third scotland six two squared and if you're the

1563
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:01,990
ellipse equation for this simple

1564
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:04,250
axisaligned ellipse

1565
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:06,720
in terms of these two called

1566
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:10,900
it becomes and find equations like a linear equation plus constant

1567
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:15,500
it's not

1568
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,620
it's always

1569
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:31,920
all this means is that

1570
01:42:38,090 --> 01:42:42,240
so there's a structure

1571
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:43,550
so the

1572
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:48,190
results of

1573
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:51,090
he was

1574
01:42:54,290 --> 01:42:58,990
so we can

1575
01:42:59,050 --> 01:43:03,220
she because they can use

1576
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:46,930
i was being true because you would probably

1577
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:54,650
as you probably agree the way we are feeling is the way we are thinking

1578
01:43:54,660 --> 01:44:01,900
you can't assume that people are robots and you know they come to the meeting

1579
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:04,100
can they will start being productive

1580
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:05,960
there are human beings

1581
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:08,620
and it all depends upon

1582
01:44:08,630 --> 01:44:10,550
how the hell do they feel

1583
01:44:10,570 --> 01:44:13,830
and it's good to know about it because then

1584
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:17,590
you can accommodate the meeting in such a way

1585
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:24,240
so it's very important to start with the very basic very humane question actually

1586
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:30,400
just a few words about to meet to explain you why am i getting q

1587
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:33,020
how to have had to have a meeting

1588
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:37,360
because i've done lots of meetings lately

1589
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:42,710
in the past five years being the only licensed trainer for the bonsai techniques

1590
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:47,240
and much more important his school years doctor the bone actually than i am because

1591
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:49,530
i don't have the bonus evangelist

1592
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:53,500
actually and that's the expression i'm using all the time

1593
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,000
here's the guy

1594
01:44:57,020 --> 01:45:02,050
who is considered the leading authority of creative conceptual thinking

1595
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:04,020
he made us

1596
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:07,620
i realize that thinking is only a skill

1597
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:12,220
and then we can get better at it it we tried

1598
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:14,520
the tools that he invented

1599
01:45:15,390 --> 01:45:18,960
then we just train on train ourselves

1600
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,450
he was the doctor for thirty years

1601
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:25,650
here the PG medicine impinge in psychology

1602
01:45:25,650 --> 01:45:31,890
and being conductor made him realize right actually he was starting to think

1603
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:33,490
if think that you know

1604
01:45:33,490 --> 01:45:37,870
the researchers he was doing in his body may be saying that can happen in

1605
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:39,740
the same in the brain

1606
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:43,180
and in nineteen sixty nine

1607
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:51,210
during these these brother revolution in many the right to build the mechanism of mind

1608
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:56,240
a book about what is going on in our mind how is that our mind

1609
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:57,520
to structured

1610
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,430
the brain is working

1611
01:45:59,450 --> 01:46:03,870
about you now every input that we are getting is already

1612
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:06,370
becoming a better

1613
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:10,420
and we need to break this batteries in order to

1614
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:14,800
go away out of the box out of the box is the expression that he

1615
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:19,000
it's also the expression he doesn't like to use any more

1616
01:46:19,050 --> 01:46:23,890
because he thinks it's now not in the same way he invented it

1617
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:30,440
he actually realize that our brain was maintained for routine

1618
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:32,090
which is excellent

1619
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:35,630
that's how we don't need to

1620
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:38,330
learn every morning how the how

1621
01:46:38,770 --> 01:46:40,760
you know to tie their shoes

1622
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:42,290
and make coffee

1623
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:45,690
and who are those people say hello to us in the office

1624
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:49,090
that's good about the routine

1625
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:52,760
but then there is no other things when you need to break out of the

1626
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:57,340
like to deal with the rising called the time

1627
01:46:57,350 --> 01:47:00,130
to find new concepts

1628
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:02,600
to be better to be more effective

1629
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:06,640
the ball like to just gave us the tools

1630
01:47:06,650 --> 01:47:07,670
to do it

1631
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:12,520
because otherwise we are knowledge is waiting for the idea to come

1632
01:47:12,530 --> 01:47:13,980
sometimes it does

1633
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,030
sometimes it doesn't

1634
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:21,000
and now we can use tools for it

1635
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:24,900
the tools are just for what you said not

1636
01:47:25,010 --> 01:47:29,760
normally at meetings were just debating and debating and debating

1637
01:47:29,770 --> 01:47:35,790
now trying to show off how intellectual we are how many but we at home

1638
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:36,820
you know

1639
01:47:36,830 --> 01:47:42,480
notable and i realized something that's he's calling it the intelligence tracked

1640
01:47:42,530 --> 01:47:44,460
the most intelligent people

1641
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:46,440
are not good thinkers at all

1642
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:50,440
because they think they know everything

1643
01:47:50,450 --> 01:47:56,450
but if we want to think about it not to know it normally

1644
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:58,020
in our normal way

1645
01:47:58,030 --> 01:48:01,130
we have an opinion about everything

1646
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:05,000
and then we have this needs to defend our opinions

1647
01:48:05,090 --> 01:48:08,290
i'm right you're wrong you know that

1648
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:12,590
is what he's trying to features with the six thinking hats is

1649
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:16,390
explore forest

1650
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,920
all of us

1651
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:20,710
the same at the same thing

1652
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:23,540
and and then at the end

1653
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:26,440
let's make up and opinion

1654
01:48:26,590 --> 01:48:29,840
we all agree upon

1655
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:31,090
of course

1656
01:48:31,130 --> 01:48:35,400
because then i'm not trying to push you my dear

1657
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:37,400
and you will percent it

1658
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:39,980
but you will all leave

1659
01:48:40,030 --> 01:48:43,190
for this idea that is common to all of us

1660
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:45,360
so then we can design

1661
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:50,970
the idea and that's how we design the future of it

1662
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:56,770
if you have these problems

1663
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:00,650
you get this genial idea

1664
01:49:00,650 --> 01:49:03,850
and then you try to show it to your colleagues

1665
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:08,960
and what do they do

1666
01:49:09,010 --> 01:49:12,070
you have a meaning in the night during came out in the sleep you've got

1667
01:49:12,070 --> 01:49:14,440
this great idea you come to them

1668
01:49:14,450 --> 01:49:18,500
we think next day you show it to your colleagues what do they do

1669
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:23,750
that does not is it they don't have brought

1670
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:29,400
and what they do them

1671
01:49:29,410 --> 01:49:34,030
you defended it so i will show you how good do this

1672
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:34,940
and by the they

1673
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:40,940
that even more

1674
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:45,090
and there are comics you france people who work together

1675
01:49:45,150 --> 01:49:48,150
and that's why that happens

1676
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,460
isn't it

1677
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:51,780
the question is

1678
01:49:51,810 --> 01:49:55,460
is it helpful

1679
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:58,260
they criticizes that helpful

1680
01:49:58,270 --> 01:50:02,150
you defend the idea then meaning to defend yourself

1681
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:03,610
is this helpful

1682
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:05,980
is this constructive

1683
01:50:06,110 --> 01:50:07,900
not really

1684
01:50:07,950 --> 01:50:09,440
you know

1685
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:15,650
it's something in our culture european and middle eastern culture

1686
01:50:15,690 --> 01:50:18,250
that we think we are always right

1687
01:50:18,290 --> 01:50:21,770
and the we think that argument is always winning

1688
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:25,650
that's what we think for two thousand four hundred years

1689
01:50:25,650 --> 01:50:28,900
it's not constructive but we're still doing it

1690
01:50:28,950 --> 01:50:33,210
it's a now culture it's not breeding

1691
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:36,420
our friends criticizing US

1692
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:39,850
because they want to have a normally isn't it

1693
01:50:39,860 --> 01:50:42,810
it's called the constructive critic

1694
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:47,700
i think this is the end of the fight to hear something constructive critique because

1695
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:49,300
it's the structure they

1696
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:51,620
tell you what's wrong with the idea

1697
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:53,810
in order to help you

1698
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,530
to improve it

1699
01:50:55,530 --> 01:51:00,090
the masses of the w z something the particles

1700
01:51:00,110 --> 01:51:06,660
when you went through five this actual sales of around TV and that's become the

1701
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:10,950
standard electroweak symmetry breaking news words

1702
01:51:10,970 --> 01:51:13,990
mass this broken symmetries

1703
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:17,590
it depends on is one example of this

1704
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:22,830
supersymmetry can be another manifestation of this but what this is

1705
01:51:22,850 --> 01:51:28,760
it will take place on the TV and scale that one designed to scale

1706
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:32,300
so this image is very much one of the things that people will be looking

1707
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:34,030
for and you hear a lot about it

1708
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:36,900
in the subsequent match

1709
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:39,360
so the probability now

1710
01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:40,740
and where we are today

1711
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:45,350
we have the standard model of particles and forces the standard model the quarks and

1712
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,600
instead of spending and the one missing link

1713
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:52,900
the higgs boson

1714
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:54,030
we've been seeing

1715
01:51:54,050 --> 01:51:55,790
in the simplest realization

1716
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:58,370
that's how it came with the idea

1717
01:51:58,380 --> 01:51:59,950
forty years ago

1718
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:02,290
since then there have been many

1719
01:52:02,310 --> 01:52:04,900
we find some when he goes on

1720
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:08,860
to incorporate supersymmetry into

1721
01:52:08,870 --> 01:52:12,140
the higgs mechanism meaning higgsino

1722
01:52:12,150 --> 01:52:15,810
and so on

1723
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:20,800
so it is possible that there is a whole family of higgs particles with spin

1724
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:24,470
or maybe was

1725
01:52:24,490 --> 01:52:27,720
these are things that there is some crazy ideas about

1726
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:32,640
and if one of them is located right nine nine thousand of those will be

1727
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:34,860
wrong the experiment shown

1728
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:38,720
high energy early universe

1729
01:52:38,850 --> 01:52:42,610
is a profound one that we have in the last twenty thirty years realized that

1730
01:52:42,610 --> 01:52:45,260
these experiments are recreating

1731
01:52:45,270 --> 01:52:50,500
the conditions of the physics of the early universe showing the the origins matter showing

1732
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:56,010
the existence of structured patterns below one TV which is where visitors can stop for

1733
01:52:56,010 --> 01:52:58,740
the last three thousand years

1734
01:52:59,740 --> 01:53:02,020
maybe revealing something

1735
01:53:02,030 --> 01:53:06,080
of real symmetry of montenegro about to

1736
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:08,430
and the puzzles are

1737
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:10,120
the nature of the dark matter

1738
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:16,620
it turns out supersymmetry if the lightest supersymmetric particles are protein is what we know

1739
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:18,560
switch which are to neutral

1740
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:19,740
it is possible

1741
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:24,510
under the certain scenarios they could be metastable states and if that's the case

1742
01:53:24,550 --> 01:53:26,610
then you could

1743
01:53:26,650 --> 01:53:30,810
there is a universal gravitation together to make a large

1744
01:53:31,150 --> 01:53:33,720
close which will not challenge

1745
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:37,000
it could be that they are the they succeed

1746
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:38,990
dark matter

1747
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,990
if it turns out that he finds the licensing

1748
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,150
articles are neutral and stable that would be a remarkable connection to get the cosmology

1749
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:50,230
particle physics but if that's the case

1750
01:53:50,250 --> 01:53:53,240
major knows that the experiment hopes

1751
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:55,320
two years

1752
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:59,510
the problem is you around forty years is now being solved

1753
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:02,190
what perfectly

1754
01:54:02,190 --> 01:54:04,660
it's somehow with the

1755
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:06,670
the fact that neutrinos have masses

1756
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:10,160
exactly what matters are we don't you know

1757
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:14,190
the observation of neutrino oscillations detail has not yet been really

1758
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,740
everything one

1759
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:20,350
question one of the three generations

1760
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:21,800
why not why

1761
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:27,000
well mathematically it seems that if you have three you very naturally generate a solution

1762
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,890
for matter and antimatter

1763
01:54:28,890 --> 01:54:33,570
the rather arcane time strange spent much of matter

1764
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:38,530
but why is the asymmetry between matter and antimatter the basic stuff that makes us

1765
01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:39,650
it is still

1766
01:54:39,670 --> 01:54:43,330
really question which is my argument and we are hoping to get some further so

1767
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:45,940
is there is no mention

1768
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:47,400
it mentions well

1769
01:54:47,450 --> 01:54:52,270
that is an intriguing question string theory suggests that the three space and one time

1770
01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:52,950
we know

1771
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:56,610
obviously the large scale remnants of higher dimensions

1772
01:54:56,660 --> 01:55:00,860
but are there is maybe we want to do this

1773
01:55:00,890 --> 01:55:02,230
very early times

1774
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:04,670
the possibility that one of these might be

1775
01:55:04,710 --> 01:55:08,070
large enough effect to manifest itself in c

1776
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:09,900
this something like sighted people

1777
01:55:09,910 --> 01:55:13,430
and you hear something that is well i'm sure

1778
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:16,990
so what do in the last twenty minutes or so

1779
01:55:17,010 --> 01:55:17,990
these two

1780
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,540
try to look into the future to give the qualitative theory what all the symmetry

1781
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:25,490
breaking stuff that underlies the is

1782
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:28,260
from the first lecture

1783
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:29,660
where we came in

1784
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:36,260
with this temperature scale this energy scale physics place at different times see if that

1785
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,800
get the full patterns

1786
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:41,450
the change from one temperature to another

1787
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:43,830
that's the whole thing

1788
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:45,460
in more

1789
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:53,530
so we started

1790
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:56,000
temperatures below

1791
01:55:56,010 --> 01:55:59,550
freezing point of water imagine snowflake

1792
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:02,810
so you have to have the same thing

1793
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,820
i had a my speech

1794
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:08,340
we have is not because the snowflake

1795
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:10,460
people sixfold symmetry to it

1796
01:56:13,790 --> 01:56:16,510
the underlying rules makes snowflakes

1797
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:18,420
satan or in snowflake

1798
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:20,100
in the original

1799
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:26,470
complete rotation symmetry says this ways for that individual snowflake falls

1800
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:30,780
and let's say it's got one of ten to twelve o'clock that forces the other

1801
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:32,160
ones to being that they are

1802
01:56:32,170 --> 01:56:34,340
and that are more so the snowflake

1803
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:36,770
made the h two s

1804
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:38,230
and frozen finds

1805
01:56:38,230 --> 01:56:41,140
now if i increase the temperature above

1806
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:43,990
two hundred seventy three degrees kelvin

1807
01:56:44,010 --> 01:56:45,590
it melts

1808
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:49,080
so the pattern has been lost to h two survive

1809
01:56:49,090 --> 01:56:54,570
and there is not pattern which is called the periodic table the atomic elements

1810
01:56:54,860 --> 01:56:58,610
ten which is in a sense a pattern in the physical part pattern is of

1811
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:01,060
the palace which

1812
01:57:01,110 --> 01:57:02,490
it's about

1813
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:08,150
and that to survives as long as you temperatures almost ten thousand degrees all your

1814
01:57:08,150 --> 01:57:09,980
energies less than

1815
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:11,790
if you

1816
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:15,070
about entities above temperatures

1817
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:19,310
the atoms ionized completely destroyed plants

1818
01:57:19,330 --> 01:57:22,680
so when that happens no one

1819
01:57:22,690 --> 01:57:28,990
that's what i mean by different isotopes by you going to some new laboratories you

1820
01:57:29,070 --> 01:57:31,500
a pattern of nuclear isotopes wall

1821
01:57:31,580 --> 01:57:34,190
that's what this strange died there

1822
01:57:35,390 --> 01:57:37,190
this pattern

1823
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:41,350
to invisible GV's which points

1824
01:57:41,370 --> 01:57:45,350
they begin to melt away see the quarks gluons manifest themselves

1825
01:57:45,370 --> 01:57:50,230
and and that is where a lot of many years

1826
01:57:50,340 --> 01:57:54,430
energy is where the base class

1827
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:56,710
and indeed it

1828
01:57:56,720 --> 01:58:00,790
and it's from that generated the standard model

1829
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:04,460
so the present as of the quarks leptons

1830
01:58:04,470 --> 01:58:08,050
is the standard model is a pattern based on mass

1831
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:09,910
the up and down quarks

1832
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:16,470
chance to get heavy top bottom and and if it were not about

1833
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:19,430
these three different levels would say

1834
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:23,740
the photon is massless w z or not

1835
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:28,730
but otherwise it's the same day the sun shone for five billion years because the

1836
01:58:28,730 --> 01:58:30,870
w has

1837
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:32,080
we're not

1838
01:58:32,110 --> 01:58:35,760
in the town if it's just like this

1839
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:38,560
so this mass is cracked is

1840
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:40,000
four so

1841
01:58:40,050 --> 01:58:41,500
of the lines of true

1842
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:46,600
and that we suspect reveals if we could know calculate these patterns and the theory

1843
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:48,770
suggests that not always takes place

1844
01:58:48,770 --> 01:58:50,750
very well the way

1845
01:58:50,770 --> 01:58:55,370
professor stevens would think of this as being segments where each segment is made up

1846
01:58:55,370 --> 01:58:58,310
of a bundle of these distinctive features

1847
01:58:58,420 --> 01:59:01,310
so that that's how it works for him

1848
01:59:02,770 --> 01:59:06,690
this is guided in people have attempted to build systems that look like

1849
01:59:06,710 --> 01:59:11,330
the other important component that i that sort of left out here and that he

1850
01:59:11,330 --> 01:59:15,670
addresses in sort of a separate thing is the notion of being able to

1851
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:24,560
these hypothesized word sequences by really basically taking these hypothesized sequences that you that you

1852
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:27,420
produced in your own mind here in

1853
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:34,270
he then sort of re synthesize landmarks and accused accuse somehow internally compare those with

1854
01:59:34,270 --> 01:59:36,040
the evidence that you've been given

1855
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:38,210
and then possibly risk score

1856
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:43,890
the the hypothesis that you that you have come up with so the idea is

1857
01:59:43,890 --> 01:59:49,770
that this rescoring process allows you to incorporate some other higher level source of knowledge

1858
01:59:49,770 --> 01:59:53,920
some other context that might not be part of this initial change

1859
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:54,810
and we

1860
01:59:54,810 --> 02:00:00,440
and again for those of us in ASR in language processing in natural language processing

1861
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:05,520
it's like work restoring alastair

1862
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:07,080
OK so

1863
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:10,060
is how we do the times and we

1864
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:13,080
so we use the break timer should i keep going

1865
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:16,460
eleven OK

1866
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:20,620
o i'm fine phi i was the need to hurry through that stuff in

1867
02:00:22,370 --> 02:00:25,210
what we've done is we've just

1868
02:00:25,230 --> 02:00:28,170
motivated by the use of these things with

1869
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:33,900
talk a little bit about fundamentals of distinctive features theory

1870
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:36,890
and describe how all this sort of fits in

1871
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:39,770
two models of perception

1872
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:43,120
now we will sort of go into

1873
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:46,850
how we can exploit these models and automatic speech recognition

1874
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:48,960
we'll talk about methods for

1875
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:53,460
phonological distinctive features

1876
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:56,710
and will

1877
02:00:56,730 --> 02:01:02,690
talk about how we can actually incorporate distinctive feature knowledge in ASR model structure

1878
02:01:02,850 --> 02:01:07,940
rather advanced models of articulatory

1879
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:10,040
of vocal tract dynamics

1880
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:12,540
that's sort of the holy grail

1881
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:15,670
can we model the entire system

1882
02:01:15,690 --> 02:01:19,790
and what you know what we got that we're done think and but that's a

1883
02:01:19,790 --> 02:01:23,210
very difficult problem and then the

1884
02:01:23,230 --> 02:01:25,670
and then i'll talk about

1885
02:01:25,710 --> 02:01:32,920
work that's been done trying to integrate distinctive features in traditional ASR systems

1886
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:36,170
the that's less of the holy grail that's easier

1887
02:01:36,190 --> 02:01:39,890
we know what can we do to sort of take

1888
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:46,750
feature representations somehow complement the knowledge that we have an existing resources

1889
02:01:46,750 --> 02:01:48,290
o too much one

1890
02:01:49,370 --> 02:01:51,120
i'll talk about

1891
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:55,350
in when we talk about distinctive feature defection

1892
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:58,440
i guess the first issue is is

1893
02:01:58,460 --> 02:02:03,480
what sort of systems that we use to describe

1894
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:07,540
the distinctive features will have some examples of that

1895
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:14,640
talk about how we might obtain acoustic parameters from surface acoustic measurements you know what

1896
02:02:14,690 --> 02:02:19,140
acoustic evidence to we use as input to these feature detectors

1897
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:29,390
how we might incorporating pdfs and training incorporating them in ASR systems training detectors and

1898
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:32,830
the actual algorithms themselves

1899
02:02:34,170 --> 02:02:35,540
it turns out that there

1900
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:41,310
really not too many systems that actually exploit direct articulatory measurements in the big exception

1901
02:02:41,310 --> 02:02:46,850
is what i mentioned earlier is in audio visual ASR you can imagine having the

1902
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:47,830
real system

1903
02:02:47,850 --> 02:02:52,140
with a camera that that provides this

1904
02:02:52,140 --> 02:02:54,730
this visual side channel

1905
02:02:54,750 --> 02:03:00,690
and that give you these visual features that provide you with sort of partial articulatory

1906
02:03:02,330 --> 02:03:07,970
another example that's that's actually got a lot of attention there's these things called gems

1907
02:03:07,970 --> 02:03:14,330
sensors and i forget which m stands for now talk about later but the basic

1908
02:03:14,330 --> 02:03:20,660
and low power radar sensors you put here you right around your glottis and they

1909
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:24,550
there's was pretty substantial research project about

1910
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,550
i think about three or four years ago

1911
02:03:26,550 --> 02:03:33,960
when people would be wearing these things and you actually use those as as complementary

1912
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:36,980
you know i

1913
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:39,350
information for doing is are

1914
02:03:39,670 --> 02:03:45,480
it's that kind of thing is really valuable and really high noise environments and you

1915
02:03:46,010 --> 02:03:51,800
fighter pilots those guys are wearing these masks that every another super-high noise so they're

1916
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:52,770
looking for

1917
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:54,090
nine acoustic

1918
02:03:54,090 --> 02:03:58,870
the information to to use for controlling

1919
02:03:58,890 --> 02:04:01,880
voice control systems only in the cockpit

1920
02:04:02,290 --> 02:04:07,130
professor while mention the there's a colleague of mine who actually had a voice controlled

1921
02:04:07,130 --> 02:04:09,590
cockpit at MIT

1922
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:12,930
but you know it's there are there are there are functions that are good to

1923
02:04:12,930 --> 02:04:17,020
have a voice control and those that are not like you know writer down into

1924
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:24,920
control the radio and the fact that they are not the car they they're playing

1925
02:04:24,940 --> 02:04:29,090
but on the other hand we have a lot of ASR systems that exploit

1926
02:04:29,310 --> 02:04:36,590
phonological distinctive features and the the way they are exploited is by way of

1927
02:04:36,610 --> 02:04:42,670
the hidden process they can sort of service and under underlying state space

1928
02:04:42,690 --> 02:04:45,470
in in an HMM system

1929
02:04:45,470 --> 02:04:49,590
and we can in using them we hope to

1930
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:56,440
exploit all of these great advantage is that we discussed at the very beginning that
