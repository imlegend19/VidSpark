1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,650
and on and so on his own

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,550
it's all

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,250
and each

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,490
link graph

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,390
so what

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,740
we don't have any other

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,020
we do not like this

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,180
this is for you

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,620
so to say

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,330
all right support she really just

11
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,420
during this something also to just

12
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,310
you know

13
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,690
you've s

14
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,770
is something similar

15
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,680
what we need to address

16
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,380
the signal

17
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:05,600
in some more

18
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,220
in some sense

19
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,200
is still

20
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,960
very common more

21
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,660
just to give you

22
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,210
and what's more

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,330
so what you

24
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,640
i just want to

25
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,740
all of this

26
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,440
this is a year or so you know

27
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,870
now is all so

28
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,280
all these

29
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,430
most people of know

30
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,430
you have your

31
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,990
which is

32
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,440
problem which requires that change

33
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,110
and this for all time

34
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,980
apparently mild strains just fine

35
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,140
also three

36
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,980
let me know

37
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,520
so called

38
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,180
and then most

39
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,210
much more

40
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,660
four or one

41
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,400
trust and so

42
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,350
so the information

43
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,170
one more test it so it

44
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,960
perhaps the key issues

45
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,000
so here are

46
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,870
it's very

47
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,790
also show here

48
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,780
first of all

49
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,770
so who would fit in a result

50
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,960
our problem by

51
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,600
it's very well mention is

52
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,510
one of the problems

53
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:50,590
people have

54
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,730
right right

55
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,570
it is

56
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,770
or something else

57
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,700
there are more

58
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,180
but what

59
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,840
one of the

60
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,400
number one

61
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,450
well we may have

62
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,610
and he is only

63
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,210
yes or no

64
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,780
suppose that more sure

65
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,140
what i want to

66
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,360
if i want to send a message

67
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,530
from this

68
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,240
is that all draw

69
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,210
make sure

70
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,280
if this is

71
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,860
x j

72
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,960
this is x y

73
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,610
you have

74
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,760
two x

75
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,880
incoming messages

76
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,780
if i want to compute the message

77
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,110
from j

78
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,330
two five

79
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,650
that will be a function of x i right

80
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,220
message if you want to compute

81
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,830
message here is another message

82
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,630
aerial graph

83
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,990
i want to compute this message here

84
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,820
which is the message

85
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,550
j two y

86
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,550
x y

87
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,270
this will be equal to what

88
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,660
next of GI effects

89
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:08,660
this will be able to this potential here

90
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,850
and as such

91
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,460
i effect size

92
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,630
because the potential of x

93
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,310
i xj

94
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,400
which is is incorrect

95
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,490
the conditional risk

96
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,490
just doing the

97
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,790
just marker of field version

98
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,320
the same

99
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,460
o silly

100
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,860
times the problem

101
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,770
overall k

102
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,570
where k is different from my

103
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,950
of the messages from can

104
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,830
of x j

105
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,520
this is a message from the ones

106
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,590
this message of a

107
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,430
two of acts

108
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,420
can use message here will be this potential

109
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,280
i'm the product of all the comments

110
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,760
it is not

111
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,500
once the computer all those messages i just compute the marginal by the product of

112
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,590
the the message

113
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,170
but c

114
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:52,360
and you can plot

115
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,100
you will see that in the fall

116
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,110
also partners works with three is OK

117
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,850
we'll see how that works in real life

118
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,510
we may also use the max product so instead of for example computing

119
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,930
the marginal probability may want to ask what is the most likely realisation of key

120
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,050
set for

121
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,000
because q

122
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,950
to talk about the same thing

123
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,280
this not such

124
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,840
as i mentioned so what if we have a bipartite graph

125
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,900
you have my photographs

126
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:52,160
it's going to be complicated more but still has also

127
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,020
that's the case

128
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,030
let's assume that we are going to use the elimination because remember we used the

129
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:04,800
elimination of previous before these graph here

130
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,520
and elimination of it and we can we don't need the three we can apply

131
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,600
to any

132
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,450
and you know

133
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,760
what you're going to the nodes to generalise the

134
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,900
information our

135
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,420
the case where you can make

136
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,920
more sophisticated version of the nation of four i've had such that you can reuse

137
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,090
of your application

138
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,440
in a similar way

139
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,850
as we

140
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,290
propagation with

141
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,410
for example assume we have this graph you observe divided x six

142
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:46,450
if you want to compute p of x one given x six

143
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,360
then you go and do all this

144
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,290
i want to go through this

145
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,190
showed you already how it works

146
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,150
all elimination

147
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,910
now in the end you compute this score

148
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,010
now assume you want know the query you want to compute p of extreme given

149
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,720
x six

150
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,720
first you wanted to create your x one given x six now

151
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,010
i created this p of x three given x

152
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,340
what is do

153
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,620
but it can also be the same thing

154
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,990
but you will notice that there are some of these functions the computer along the

155
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,880
that you've already computed before

156
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,060
for the first

157
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,440
we have something like this is the competition for the first the competition for the

158
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,920
second we

159
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,500
and you have repeated computation

160
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,740
these things are you using

161
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,830
still you want

162
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,070
somehow avoid computing these things

163
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,770
union a mechanism to actually avoid

164
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,080
we solve this in the case of the

165
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,660
if you have three

166
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,630
but what if you have a general graph

167
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,610
i think that becomes

168
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,580
more more interesting more complicated

169
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,600
the answer is something called the junction three of

170
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,780
which is basically what we want to work before the break

171
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,690
what he

172
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:26,150
the junction tree algorithm is a generalisation of belief propagation

173
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,450
so in theory

174
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,610
you can apply to any graph can be a bayesian network can be lot of

175
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,190
it doesn't matter

176
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,640
you can find some way to go

177
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,300
like the belief propagation with

178
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,820
my friend there's no time and no

179
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,550
and then there is one in the middle if you subtract one

180
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,260
three minus one is to in second harmonic

181
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,250
so now i will try to generate very high frequency

182
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,490
in residents and then you count the number of nodes subtract one

183
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,090
and then you know which harmonic

184
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,010
i was able to generate

185
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,590
about fighting

186
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,160
not so easy to get the residents in there

187
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,410
so i'm off resonance

188
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,940
two people

189
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:32,120
on so i

190
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,030
i'm going to come

191
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,410
we to

192
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,590
july twenty

193
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,500
i can

194
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,680
so that's standing waves

195
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,480
and you see the shape

196
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,990
use so the

197
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,110
the mode of operation

198
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,520
very characteristic for standing waves

199
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,480
when i plucked string

200
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,460
or i strike it was invisible

201
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,420
or is the hammer

202
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,030
on the piano is the hammer comes down

203
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,130
that is exposing the

204
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,660
the whole set of frequencies

205
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,390
and so the string now

206
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,850
besides which frequencies it like two

207
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,460
oscillating and so it selects

208
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,430
these resonance frequencies

209
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,160
so if the strange

210
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,690
as the fundamental four hundred hertz

211
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,340
that it will start to resonate four hundred

212
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,590
but simultaneously it would be very happy with eight hundred hertz and withdraw from the

213
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,110
and so the string will simultaneously if i bang it

214
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,610
or striking it or pocket simultaneously

215
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,850
also made

216
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,810
often have more than one frequency fundamental

217
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,350
and several of the higher

218
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,850
how monarchs

219
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,350
and all the others present all the other frequencies in this

220
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,850
striking was the ball

221
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,850
i ignored because of resonance

222
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,590
so if you decide a string instrument

223
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:14,580
and this is really a key equation

224
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,550
if you want a particular fundamental

225
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,880
say you fundamentalist four hundred and forty and this is given number

226
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,680
and so n is one

227
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,440
you can now manipulate

228
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,600
because the

229
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,710
depends on the tension in the string

230
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,820
and it depends on what kind of string

231
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,790
this breed

232
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,370
in the string

233
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,280
is the square root of the tension

234
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,080
if you take all three

235
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,130
you even see approval for that

236
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,710
divided by the mass of the string

237
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,740
per unit length

238
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,040
of the string

239
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:56,870
so you take for strings for violins six forty five

240
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,330
you make them out of very different materials

241
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,500
different bass per unit length

242
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,090
and so that gives you then

243
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,950
different velocities you can also

244
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,610
four around with attention

245
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,130
so the four strings and have all four

246
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,060
a different

247
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,370
in the violin they may have the same length

248
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,150
what are you going to do now to play the violin

249
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,000
all that is left over is albert the only thing you can change that's what

250
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,540
the violinist is doing

251
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,140
the finger back and forth over the strings make them shorter

252
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,190
it's goes up frequency goes up makes them longer frequency goes down the same

253
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,360
same was based on the challenge

254
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,480
so when you're playing what you're doing all the time is changing l

255
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,830
but as you get all these frequencies that you want to produce

256
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,590
if you can your instrument out of the closet

257
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,830
you may have noticed that it's not really into anymore it's slightly of two

258
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,400
well what you can do now

259
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,480
you can change the little bit

260
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,300
these little knobs

261
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,590
you can change the tension in the string

262
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,710
that's what violence do when they

263
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,540
their violin they

264
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,200
change the tension on the string to get just the right

265
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:11,080
but the playing means change l

266
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,130
i was different that's really luxury pianos eighty eight keys

267
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,700
and the length of each

268
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,840
a set of strings is fixed so you don't have to worry about that

269
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,910
it's a great luxury you may think therefore that it is much easier to play

270
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,930
the piano player violence

271
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,510
because you don't have to do this all the time and be exactly at the

272
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,870
right length

273
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,800
well that true of course but

274
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,790
given the fact that you have eighty eight keys you can imagine you can also

275
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,340
occasionally wrong key

276
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,180
and that's not what you want

277
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,850
if strings vibrating

278
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,420
it is pushing on the end it's pulling on the air and is producing by

279
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,580
what we call pressure waves

280
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,990
if i have a strange oscillates four hundred hertz

281
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,680
it makes pressure waves

282
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,530
pressure goes up down up down up down

283
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,350
four hundred times per second goes up

284
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,910
it reaches your eardrum in your neurons starts to shake

285
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,650
four hundred times per second

286
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,890
goes back and forth

287
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,140
your brain saying

288
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,890
i just sound

289
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,550
that's the way it works so it is the string

290
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,910
when you get

291
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,120
pressure waves

292
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,800
and then you get you drunk

293
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,580
and then

294
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,060
you get the brains if there are any

295
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,830
i want to discuss the issue before i demonstrate some of this

296
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,960
in this case you in some entries don't have straight i will call them all

297
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,610
woodwind instruments although

298
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,690
that's perhaps not an appropriate name

299
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,930
for all of them but i just call them woodwinds twenty

300
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,330
suppose i have here

301
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,780
a box which is filled with air

302
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,550
completely closed what has a length l

303
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,770
and i put it here

304
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,010
and i generate a particular frequency of sound

305
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,390
then the pressure waves are going to run

306
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,830
going to bounce off and they come back

307
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,170
and again reflect traveling waves

308
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,090
and when i get inside the box now

309
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,130
i get standing waves of air it's not the box that goes into was standing

310
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,160
resonance but is the area itself

311
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,850
and the frequencies that are produced which the system is in resonance

312
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,150
is given by exactly the same equation

313
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,190
except now

314
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,120
that he is non-negotiable

315
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,430
these now to speed of sound

316
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,880
which room temperature

317
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,580
it's about three hundred and forty meters

318
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,070
a second

319
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,950
so whatever you design

320
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,830
we we woodwind instruments

321
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,230
that is non-negotiable you can not

322
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,570
change the which you can do when you are in some of strings

323
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,640
you will say g

324
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,460
if i have an instrument by the sound inside a closed box you're not going

325
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,640
to be very well that's true

326
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,650
you must let the sun go out somehow

327
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,760
what is surprising

328
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,300
if you take this and out of

329
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,760
you take this and of

330
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,170
that this

331
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:02,770
box which is now open on both sides will still resonate exactly those frequencies

332
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,520
want to take a two three

333
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,540
we get to the bottom of this

334
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,760
they also resonance frequencies

335
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,590
in case

336
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,850
that the

337
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,770
sounds like everything i call it sound cavity

338
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:18,480
it's much worse than a transcendental number is transcendental yes you can prove it because

339
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,170
it work if it were not to break number

340
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,540
it would be highly compressible OK this number

341
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,660
has infinite complexity in fact each bit of this

342
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,810
number is one bit of complexity

343
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,850
there is no redundancy here is irreducible in other words even though this number is

344
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,640
well defined mathematically very simply the halting probability by that some that i showed you

345
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,170
its numerical value

346
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,910
it is a sort of a given human limitations it's like the perfect simulation of

347
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,140
independent also a fair coin in pure maths

348
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,540
because we can never know bits so it's not only uncomputable i mean turing in

349
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,080
nineteen thirty six already had an uncomputable this is computable in the worst possible way

350
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,780
the smallest program you know for any number of bits of this you know capital

351
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,790
and this is the smallest program for and bits of this

352
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:10,350
you know if you want to get the first n bits here

353
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,940
smallest program

354
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,690
also has and bits

355
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,690
and the smallest axioms from which you can deduce

356
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,120
what those things are sort of computing them

357
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,020
also and

358
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,020
in other words its irreducible computationally

359
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,230
the first n bits of this

360
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,690
the smallest program to calculate them will have about the same size and for any

361
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,500
n and also if you're just trying to deduce you know have theorems use axioms

362
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,140
to prove what each bit is for the first n bits

363
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,140
to be able to prove what the first n bits are you will need about

364
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,790
a bit of axioms so this is a irreducible truth

365
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:55,060
what that is not seriously intended the large

366
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,420
you get into trouble

367
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,870
yes and a friend of mine chris collude has

368
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,250
have done that exercise

369
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:13,790
for small for small for some of the initial bits in fact depending on your

370
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,850
programming language you can look at all the small programs and you can

371
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,980
you can get lower bounds and even upper bounds you know but very soon you

372
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,420
start getting in trouble because of the general result

373
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,960
well it depends on the programme language here

374
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,750
you know it's one of the first bits are ones you can actually prove the

375
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,350
initial once you can always prove that their ones by getting better and better lower

376
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,390
so the string of the ones at the beginning can be too long anyway what

377
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,520
it says

378
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:53,100
the idea and to tell you is that these bits are irreducible complexity in pure

379
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,020
so in a way

380
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,640
what they show you is is that pure mathematics is the beautiful

381
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,980
so let me just like this in terms

382
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,580
nobody has held up a sign yet OK so i still have little time or

383
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,690
i'm now

384
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,230
OK OK so let me

385
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,020
let me try to use latin in terminology for this which i think is relevant

386
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,170
light has a principle called the principle of sufficient reason

387
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,250
which says if something is true is true for a reason

388
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:25,790
you know and if something is true in mathematics the the reason is called proof

389
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,120
and if you want to simplify what mathematicians do is they find through their job

390
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,620
is to show the reason to find the reason something is true OK well

391
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,290
the bits of this number

392
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:38,290
each of them has to be user one mathematically determined in the world of pure

393
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,500
thought it's determined there is no freedom this is an individual real number a specific

394
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,330
real number but so delicately balanced between zero and one that we're never going to

395
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,850
know in other words

396
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,330
in a sense

397
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:53,020
but if we try to prove that are calculated you know the one thing is

398
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,940
the world of pure math platonic world of ideas or what god's mind you know

399
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,060
may contain the value of this number but for us

400
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,710
the way it works is

401
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,750
the region of interest

402
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:13,520
and use containing simplex instead of containing ellipsoid to do essentially the same thing

403
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,950
my guess is that that algorithm in fact is practical the body ever implemented and

404
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,310
this is from the he might

405
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,480
and it does work well that's probably the best thing to do

406
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:34,080
used to minimize a submodular function

407
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,060
all right so now you know you know the two theorems you know the two

408
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:44,850
theorems that are fundamental to minimizing submodular function and all the direct algorithms we know

409
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:48,370
for minimizing a submodular function

410
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,810
in use these two algorithms

411
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,080
and use these two terms in some form or another

412
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,230
sometimes are

413
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,210
and a disguised form but using these two basic

414
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,020
and there are lots of algorithms now

415
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,560
lots of direct algorithms other all the time

416
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:12,790
but they are all involved

417
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,790
we've got a set of points and expressing

418
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:22,200
we've got a set of extreme points expressing a point as a convex combination

419
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,080
and we

420
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,210
we move subject to be mixed

421
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,500
expressible by that convex combination

422
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,200
every once in a while we we

423
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,080
express it differently

424
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,730
that's where all the algorithms were

425
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,700
and very nicely

426
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,500
no removing the

427
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,410
the next terms that there go way beyond

428
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:56,450
submodular minimisation it's like submodular minimisation this is entirely analogous to

429
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:00,480
maxflow mincut problems

430
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:09,060
you have a general weights from maxflow mincut problem in general weights the dole problem

431
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,180
being the capacities of the primal problem right

432
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,910
its minimum cost flow

433
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,660
where you have

434
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,270
cos on the flows

435
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,410
in the primal problem and then you want to

436
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,250
as for minimum cost flow

437
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,330
prior to the ceremony talk about now

438
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:43,450
is a generalisation abstract version of the minimum cost network flow

439
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,080
whereas submodular minimisation is an

440
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,480
maximum network flow

441
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:57,270
this is a generalisation cost well for two in nature

442
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:01,930
pollinator i'm i in time

443
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:08,080
i'm almost done but they do it

444
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,410
you get two

445
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,750
following we tried

446
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,750
given by

447
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,060
i hope i've showed you few times now what

448
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,290
that p e

449
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,640
i mean

450
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,080
we had expressed

451
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:39,870
we've seen it several times

452
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,140
i was scared that that's it then that is

453
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:57,180
that characterizes the facets of the binary tree but we don't really need that

454
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,500
we're we're somewhere is our definition

455
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,200
here you find there we go

456
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,370
this is i just want to remind you of our notation

457
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,330
here that means the polytope

458
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,370
was set affordances e polytope

459
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,620
given by any qualities that forms

460
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,810
where this

461
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,290
is a polymatroid function right

462
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,580
and we applied the greedy algorithms

463
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,250
to find an optimum vertex of that single

464
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,270
but now

465
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,430
integer polymatroid

466
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,230
their intersection there

467
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:52,980
does the same thing for an arbitrary pair of politics may try

468
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,250
you can be given to

469
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,120
integer polymatroid

470
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,270
all in the same space that's all

471
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:06,080
according ties but the same vectors

472
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:12,060
vertices and each of those polytopes is given by the greedy algorithm applied to those

473
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,830
but amazingly

474
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,040
intersection of those two polytopes

475
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,500
is still in integer values

476
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,270
here we're intersecting two

477
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,450
polytopes with energy vibrancy but the intersection

478
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:36,750
the vertices of are also

479
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:42,930
that's what in fact more than that the two systems defining those two polytopes

480
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,270
are so-called totally

481
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,970
TDI i totally due

482
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,730
and to

483
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,580
that means that if there

484
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,520
if the objective function is all managers

485
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:05,370
even if the polymatroid is not an integer value

486
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:10,680
the primal objective function is are integers

487
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,250
there's going to be an integer values

488
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:19,890
and an integer valued one that optimizes the

489
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:25,660
now it follows from that that is the

490
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,200
parliamentary functions are integer values

491
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:33,410
then there's going to be an integer valued at

492
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,770
that optimizes in the in the

493
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,790
primal optimisation over these two

494
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,830
that's what TD and this means and total

495
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,040
that's used in virtually every

496
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:50,080
well solved combinatorial optimisation problems

497
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,270
by the way there are a lot of work there a lot of other well

498
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,930
sort of combinatorial optimization problems

499
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,680
i find it in this

500
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,850
the difference here

501
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,530
so not similarly to what we that we've done for the perceptron

502
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,520
we go to

503
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,250
and they can look

504
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,320
but now we take a look at the square this grid

505
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,400
the square of the difference

506
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,960
so we take can look at

507
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,520
minus that the minus one

508
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,650
we can use here

509
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,460
and what is what is known as the law

510
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,340
of course sign

511
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,990
i would say that

512
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,510
and to explain this

513
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,110
a little bit

514
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,450
to say that this is the most

515
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,690
the difference between

516
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,520
the difference between this

517
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,430
and some new

518
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,980
in the difference between

519
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,540
in the same you

520
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,240
where you

521
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:16,490
of the three

522
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:30,980
we them

523
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,530
the are

524
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,880
we are we are proving convergence here so i said in the beginning but it

525
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:52,150
now so we're looking at the list three just like in the pacific coming

526
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,750
OK so we assume the existence of some you that

527
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,230
is about a third and we choose to

528
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,060
long enough so that she separation with the nineteen one

529
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:13,530
it's just before we have mainly we absolutely terrible they were fighting over

530
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,740
is the same as company

531
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,110
why is this true

532
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:22,920
because the polymer remember the picture had there

533
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,800
so we have about fifty minus one

534
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,470
then we have a linear constraints which is the variety of the show that that

535
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,380
user modeling one

536
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,290
and we project this guy

537
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,140
on the

538
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,460
onto hyperplane

539
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,710
in we got that it

540
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,000
and then you

541
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,450
you a guy that satisfies all the contract so in particular which satisfy this conference

542
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:55,320
here so will achieve margin you so this is the constraint that is given by

543
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,480
example x y t

544
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,960
OK so you despite all of them in particular satisfy his car

545
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,860
so you

546
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,770
will be somewhere over here

547
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,700
by definition of the

548
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,700
but was looking at this triangle here

549
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,520
and the local sites such that the

550
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,600
the square

551
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,800
this criticized the of the

552
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,550
will then i'm you you've got me if i can engage people should force my

553
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,020
personality and what i do

554
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,180
to get better results will then you've got me

555
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,450
so we took that definition

556
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:40,450
and over a period of a year we use the system called our checkpoint three

557
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,780
speak to

558
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,870
forty thousand or speak to a bigger part in four hundred thousand people

559
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,470
about forty thousand direct reports

560
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,000
this is

561
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,680
the biggest

562
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,550
ever study

563
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,780
i don't ever into the topic of leadership charisma

564
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,660
and without technology would not be possible with blessed

565
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,180
we have a system

566
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,540
well we put about

567
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:12,740
a quarter of a million litres through every year we assess the competency and so

568
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,580
what we did was

569
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,760
we said to these forty four hundred thousand people

570
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:21,160
here's your posterity

571
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,560
here's the definition of leadership charisma

572
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,270
to what extent does he have that

573
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:30,380
o five he has solvent for

574
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,430
quite a lot

575
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,250
three days OK

576
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,270
hardly any

577
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,240
and one

578
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,630
charismatic leaders bypassed

579
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:45,200
the guy is a black hole for charisma absolutely on inspiring most uninspiring person you

580
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,580
ever met new life

581
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,100
and at the same time as we asked them to rate them on that

582
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,390
we ask them also

583
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,850
tell us

584
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,760
what do you see them do today

585
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,170
and we use the model

586
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,390
of seventy

587
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,340
leader behaviors

588
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,740
we've developed over thirty years

589
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,770
that we know from our research

590
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,140
are the difference between the best leaders

591
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,430
and the rest between those who get

592
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,670
great results and those who don't

593
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,080
once we have that we were able to say hey

594
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:21,220
what to the people of high charisma sharing common one of the things that they

595
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,740
do today

596
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:29,350
that have that effect on people of giving that our having that charismatic impact making

597
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:34,420
people want to as i say here inspiring an attitude where they want to do

598
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,450
their very very best

599
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,410
what we found was

600
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,850
those people who scored at very high and the christmas scale

601
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,200
shared twenty six

602
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,080
very specific behaviors in common

603
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,740
there are seventy behaviours in our model twenty six of them no matter where they

604
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,280
came from in the world in our sample

605
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,800
it was four hundred thousand employees

606
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,740
rating just under forty thousand leaders

607
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:05,040
from every country we do business in worldwide

608
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:09,590
and when we looked at what the find the difference between those who had a

609
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:14,790
charismatic impact on people who are they seen as being charismatic and the others were

610
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:20,170
twenty six things that they specifically ten first the most important thing is it comes

611
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,420
down to behavior

612
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,960
is not

613
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,690
a god given

614
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,210
it becomes easier to some people

615
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,750
then it does well

616
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,150
but charisma

617
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,490
it is what people say you have

618
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,750
when they like

619
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,660
the things you do

620
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,700
think about it

621
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:47,890
in your mind imagine the most charismatic person you can think of think somebody real

622
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,090
that you know charismatic and you put them in the room

623
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,440
let's make it difficult to put a bag over the head and you tell them

624
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,580
just to stand there and say nothing and do nothing and you run for five

625
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,830
or six hundred people pass

626
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,330
what sort of impact

627
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,880
do they have in that audience

628
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:10,330
you take the bag of the head maybe they make eye contact and all something

629
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:15,860
has happened maybe just in that i contact as a little spark bottom line

630
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,620
start to have a charismatic appeal

631
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,990
when they do things that people like

632
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:28,330
when they do things that turn people on it comes down to behavior

633
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,140
if it comes down to behavior

634
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,300
it means

635
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,700
any one of us

636
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,550
can choose to be more charismatic we wish to

637
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,520
i mean one of us can choose to learn

638
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,690
and developed

639
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:47,880
and assimilate and use those behaviors the charismatic leaders use to engage people now

640
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,890
can we all be at john f kennedy

641
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,900
i theoretically yes but you know you look at the look at those highly connected

642
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,840
to steve jobs of this world somehow there's something there

643
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,850
whether it's where they the way they've been raised or whether it's in the genes

644
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:09,020
i really don't know that makes it a little bit easier for them but i

645
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,340
guarantee you

646
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,850
every single person in this room

647
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,010
particularly those of you

648
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,110
who found yourselves are found your way into leadership positions

649
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,360
i have

650
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,770
as part of your behavior

651
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,540
some of those charismatic behaviors it's normal for you

652
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:34,250
but you also lack some of them

653
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,470
any one of us

654
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,270
can choose to

655
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,140
and some of those behaviours to the way we interact with other people

656
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:47,560
and increase the charismatic impact increased engaging in fact we have a problem

657
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:51,470
the important thing is we have to know what those behaviors are first

658
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,980
let we just go back from what is now

659
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,530
i said all about behavior i wanted to i i mentioned steve jobs has anybody

660
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:03,960
seen steve jobs speak i don't mean person i mean and OK so it's pretty

661
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,510
dynamic sort of individual who is piece of video

662
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:11,620
which was before apple computers

663
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:17,050
took off to any great extent it before it before he became who he is

664
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:20,630
and it's one of the first interview city ever had and what i want you

665
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,950
to focus upon the the sound from this is not going to be great is

666
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,260
pretty low but i wanted to focus upon with this young man is how charismatic

667
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,120
is c

668
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:34,500
at this particular point in time this is before it all started happen when apple

669
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,480
computer just been founded now let me turn that machine around and you have some

670
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,340
chance of hearing the sound because the sound of this particular clip is is not

671
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:45,140
fantastic so let's try that

672
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,410
so just just look and you see

673
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,660
does this

674
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,060
when it's going into the blackboards

675
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,220
i can put

676
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,470
these magnified needles

677
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,320
in its vicinity

678
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:04,580
and they will then do this

679
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:07,490
when i put it here

680
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,500
will go like this

681
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,260
and they follow

682
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,810
tensions of the circle

683
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,210
this is the weighted we define

684
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,410
the magnetic field and the direction of the magnetic field

685
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:27,570
that the magnetic field for which we always write symbol b

686
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,000
in that it field

687
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:32,340
it is now in the clockwise direction

688
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:34,620
by convention

689
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,310
current goes

690
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,310
into the blackboard

691
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,320
and if you ever forget that

692
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,320
use what we call the right hand

693
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,090
i think corkscrew

694
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,570
and you turn clockwise

695
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,450
corkscrew goes in the board

696
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,160
that connect to be with the current

697
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,960
if you take a corkscrew

698
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:00,830
and you rotated

699
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,550
then the corkscrew country you come out of the court

700
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,570
that's how you find the magnetic field

701
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,130
going around current wires

702
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,140
it's just a convention

703
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,060
i want to show you

704
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,700
how a magnetic needle

705
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,070
response to the current

706
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,780
i have here

707
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:23,760
a wire

708
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,840
which i'm going to run

709
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,180
a fabulous amount of current something like

710
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:29,490
three hundred

711
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,900
and you're going to see the wire

712
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,330
got my lights right

713
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,950
now i want to go there the way i want to go

714
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,620
OK to optimum

715
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,520
like there

716
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,150
when i draw current you see

717
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,260
the magnetite the recall of the composite nowadays and is lined up in the direction

718
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,750
of the magnetic field of the earth

719
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,820
we're going to run three hundred and PD through here

720
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:03,250
and it will change the direction it will change the direction

721
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,950
which is is one of the magnetic field around the wire like this

722
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,820
will go like this

723
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,560
because that everyone is so high

724
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,460
things began to smell smoke within seconds

725
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,390
the better is not going to like it when i draw such a high current

726
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:24,580
i can therefore do it only for a few seconds

727
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:25,380
so this

728
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,830
on his will

729
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,410
swing is direction and it starts to oscillate i can keep the current so long

730
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,510
that it stops the oscillation

731
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,850
so i'll stop by hand and conventions that that's really

732
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,650
equilibrium position

733
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,740
so if you're ready for that

734
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,760
so we get now

735
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:46,450
watch it

736
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,520
three two one zero

737
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:54,450
now stop it because still going that's so that's the equilibrium position and now stop

738
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:55,600
the kernel

739
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,700
and now i will reverse current

740
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,450
the opposite direction

741
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,620
now you will see

742
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,120
that it swings

743
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:06,850
on a degree in a different direction three

744
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:08,420
two one zero

745
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:09,570
it goes

746
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,070
i will stop it

747
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,220
two seconds that's equilibrium position

748
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,070
now let's go

749
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:17,330
so you've seen that in the

750
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,590
a magnetic needle responded

751
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,090
to the magnetic fields

752
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,120
that was produced by the way it was the great discovery virus that

753
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,380
the discovery

754
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,100
this demonstration all by itself may not

755
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:35,330
very spectacular for you but historically is of enormous importance i would argue perhaps the

756
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:38,810
most important demonstration the most important

757
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,450
researchers ever done in physics because it connects

758
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:47,530
electricity was magnetism it was the foundation of the creation of the whole concept of

759
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:50,570
a field theory

760
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:53,280
actually people's minds reaction

761
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,740
and that means

762
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,560
that if a

763
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,700
wire that runs the current

764
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,480
has the force on the magnet

765
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:06,710
then of course the magnet must also exert force on

766
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:08,100
the wire

767
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,700
and i'm going to demonstrate that the u two

768
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:14,080
i have a much more potent

769
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,290
magnet which i will use this one

770
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:21,220
the mechanism of move so heavy that can move so now we only see the

771
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:26,310
and the basic idea is then as follows

772
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,460
as it goes in

773
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:32,070
the marginal distribution of the four investigations is also goes in

774
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,860
and the ratio of two gaussians

775
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,300
it is also against

776
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:42,580
and for all of you are going to be working on these sorts of models

777
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:46,000
you have to do this by hand once in your career

778
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,430
OK but

779
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:51,410
if you want to build this afternoon in the laboratory but

780
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,540
what we end up with

781
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,260
is that the posterior distribution

782
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,270
is also a gaussian

783
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:01,970
it's a multivariate gaussian with a mean

784
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,770
which is defined by

785
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,700
this thing here so what is this what envious of

786
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:12,400
this sort of information matrix we saw yesterday plus

787
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,930
well we've got component related to the likelihood

788
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,980
and components related to

789
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,930
the the prior

790
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,040
and then we have the projection of about observations onto the coffee

791
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,010
and the

792
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:32,720
covariance of this goes in is just this term here

793
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,710
so we know characterize the posterior

794
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,970
although the model parameters

795
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,240
given that we've

796
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:43,260
got this independent prior

797
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,260
so this is great

798
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:52,600
why is this gate well i'll show you just a second so here's a little

799
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,540
example where

800
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:57,140
generated some nonlinear data

801
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,870
and here is the

802
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:04,640
this is the is the true parameter values point five and then about minus point

803
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,050
so as i said place the prior

804
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:12,670
which professors w norton w one

805
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:17,510
to be zero so most of the probability density is centered zero

806
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:21,760
clearly prior is not terribly accurate

807
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,830
after we observe data

808
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:30,970
we then get a posterior distribution which of course is multivariate gaussian

809
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,490
and now we see that the mean value

810
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,650
has shifted from the mean value of prior

811
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,200
well with the actual truth value

812
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:44,550
and what we see

813
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:48,010
is that the was a number of things that we see here in the posterior

814
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:54,260
possible see that i've truncated this one which should obviously extend further but

815
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:59,080
just to get everything into one page distributed between plus minus one but what do

816
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:04,440
we see well the first thing we see is that the uncertainty the uncertainty posterior

817
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,390
uncertainty in the value of w know it

818
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,280
which is the

819
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,360
intercept value and

820
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,720
a lot less

821
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,820
then the the scale values

822
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:24,000
the data has been more informative of the

823
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,170
the intercept on the scale

824
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:30,800
but the other thing that we notice is that there is no covariance

825
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,080
so there is no correlation i posterior already between w norton w one

826
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:40,960
and that actually makes sense because they are generated the data was that there were

827
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,330
cross hands

828
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:47,720
was w norton w one so the posterior no really

829
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,650
captures all the information in data

830
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,000
and all the residual uncertainty

831
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,700
from our prior

832
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:01,850
so this in many ways is much more informative than the the likelihood

833
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,110
based framework

834
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,490
now what can we do with this why is this so nice

835
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:14,210
and the maximum likelihood framework of course we take the maximum likelihood estimate

836
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:18,400
and we put that in to obtain predicted values

837
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,910
and we were able to get

838
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:25,700
moments defining our our uncertainty

839
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,200
but now we've got a whole distribution

840
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:34,180
posterior distribution where we can leverage or we can marginalize

841
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,320
overall of uncertainty in the the possible parameter values

842
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,080
so it means no when we make some predictions

843
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,190
so if you got some new attributes and we want to be do prediction for

844
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,740
the target actually is

845
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:50,110
and what we do is we take expectation

846
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,240
of what our model predicts

847
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,550
conditions so there's an expectation with respect

848
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,000
two our posterior

849
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,670
and because i chosen not very nice prior and posterior which admits to make scores

850
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:08,000
for then we find that the expectation of a simple linear model

851
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,210
prior posterior expectation of the prediction of our simple linear model no boils down to

852
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:16,590
just averaging

853
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:21,140
all four the values of the random vector w

854
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,990
over the posterior

855
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,160
i have already seen that we can get

856
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,170
an analytic form for this

857
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,000
this expectation

858
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,160
which of course is just this here

859
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,740
that was the key

860
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,010
at the end

861
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,410
and likewise

862
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:42,260
the posterior predictive variance

863
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:47,490
is just a simple matter of computing these posterior variances

864
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:52,350
and because the posterior is analytic then all this is analytic as well

865
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,960
so we now have

866
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:57,310
so our posterior mean

867
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,470
posterior predictive mean

868
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,260
and the posterior predictive variance

869
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,730
so this is all very nice

870
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:11,150
and again this handles a very

871
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,440
formal way

872
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,410
all of our uncertainty

873
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,840
and also handles in very far away

874
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,050
all of the

875
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,860
assumptions that we have made explicit

876
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:25,040
and defining our prior and this is very important

877
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:29,760
we don't lose sight of any assumptions that we've maybe we've we've been forced to

878
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,470
to explicitly

879
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:36,680
define what our assumptions are when we define our prior

880
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:42,290
so from my perspective this this this framework allows you to to put some reagan

881
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:48,760
and to not lose track of of what the assumptions are new model

882
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,810
for those of you who managed to stay awake

883
00:53:54,830 --> 00:54:02,350
yesterday will recognise that this actually looks very similar to the maximum likelihood estimator

884
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,780
with the exception of this term here

885
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:13,710
so this term as i said corresponds to the ratio of the variance of the

886
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:16,000
likelihood of this is the

887
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,010
the variance of the

888
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,940
the prior

889
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:21,360
so what does this mean

890
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,400
well it means for example

891
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,260
in the case that you see when we are trying to predict the class label

892
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:32,800
small you get for cross products between clicks potentially as you can see here but

893
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,470
you can also get

894
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:38,840
a more efficient parametrisation of your problem and then maybe you can

895
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,400
you can actually so basically what you can do is actually you can read parametrize

896
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:43,930
the dual

897
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:48,140
with in this new representation and then you get more efficient

898
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:52,430
representation of the dual this is for instance what ben taskar did another listed in

899
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:53,900
his original paper

900
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:58,490
where they looked at cases where we actually they could we palmer tries do all

901
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:03,610
without using a cutting plane algorithm of o'brien selection of they would we parametrize it

902
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,030
then it's you know low dimensional enough they could actually exactly solve it

903
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:10,760
OK so that of course if you can do that and it's

904
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,300
it always depends on

905
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,030
what do you mean by tractable right it's more than efficiency

906
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:21,640
consideration here then that is the preferred over what i showed you before or

907
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,630
or it's not preferred so it's more of

908
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,800
performance tradeoffs and of course you the nice thing is that you really get an

909
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,240
exact solution so even you wouldn't have to worry about

910
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,410
the absolute intolerance although

911
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,470
that's kind of numerical noise at some point

912
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,090
so this is then also how you can set up for instance if you want

913
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:43,970
to do

914
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,950
basically something like conditional random field

915
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:52,030
with the label sequence as you know label sequence problem

916
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,840
similar to an HMM structure

917
00:55:54,840 --> 00:56:00,680
you could basically define kernels as follows just try to indicate that here you can

918
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:06,050
have these dependencies of pairs of neighboring labels so you would need to define

919
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:08,130
a kernel function that takes

920
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:12,820
one of these pairs and another these pairs and another sequence and how you could

921
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:17,930
for instance define it if you want hmm like nearest neighbor type of dependencies it

922
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,160
should be one

923
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:27,430
this this this states agree and in these two states agree OK so basically what

924
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,320
you're looking at then is

925
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,880
the same pair

926
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:33,630
of states that are neighbouring in

927
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:38,240
in the sequence right and then your that with what you're what you can't always

928
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,400
he would be i mean the kind of functions strictly with i guess would use

929
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,800
counts as overlap but

930
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,990
anyway this is to simplify the middle so you could define a kind of function

931
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:50,610
like that over these types of cliques

932
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:56,510
and you could define a kernel function over cliques that are of the form input

933
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:59,490
output and the other being the

934
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:04,260
there's unobserved state in our sort of label sequence

935
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,070
and you can say well that if the state is the same

936
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:11,300
you define to be some kind of that you just defined over the input whatever

937
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,470
you want there

938
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:14,680
and then is zero otherwise

939
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,010
right so

940
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:21,490
using that you can just very easily construct these kernels that correspond to these interactions

941
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:25,820
you can also easily figure out ways of how to generalize so for instance if

942
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,660
you want to change HMM to have a dependency between input and in the following

943
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:35,450
right then you get clicks that are like that

944
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,390
three notes like this and then basically what you would need to do is you

945
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:42,470
would need to say well if you have you know one such clique in one

946
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:44,410
and another clique over here

947
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:48,360
how would i define the kernel and for instance then you could say well you

948
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:52,240
use again the kernel defined over the inputs if

949
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,490
y is equal to you and why prime is equal to you prime so if

950
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,760
you observe the same two labels here

951
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,760
and zero otherwise

952
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:05,910
and then basically what you have done is you've incorporated these types of dependencies into

953
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:07,470
your model

954
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:12,880
so this is just one example of how you can make use of this idea

955
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,400
of of the compositionality

956
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:21,130
in as motivated by markov network yes OK and here's the slide that i thought

957
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,780
i didn't have any more

958
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,180
it's basically then what you can show is

959
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,510
if things are nicely decomposable over

960
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:33,300
basically the way i think about it here is not coming from a probabilistic model

961
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,240
per se

962
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:39,630
but i say if my function then f is decomposable over an undirected graph sort

963
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:45,450
of in the sense that it decomposes into cliques functions the the maximum complete subsets

964
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:48,530
right of of the graph

965
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:54,550
then i can have a representation as follows some over i some over cliques possible

966
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:57,910
values of the cliques and then i have a parameter

967
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:58,800
a bit

968
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:03,280
i c y c and is that is much much smaller than

969
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,510
the total

970
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:09,140
state space hopefully this right because the cliques are relatively small and i have these

971
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:14,800
things up instead of multiplying the cardinality of these guys right

972
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:17,660
and then i have this part here which involves the current right so this is

973
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:23,780
another way of getting sparser representations there's some papers here that have explored this lafferty

974
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,820
and there's more work since two thousand four when two thousand three and two thousand

975
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:32,430
four when i first formulations have that been presented

976
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:33,950
OK so

977
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:38,570
so to summarize right so there are basically two ways of solving the structured prediction

978
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,930
problem one is

979
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:45,180
where you say well i have this black box that gives me the argmax

980
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,910
and whether that user some decompositions

981
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:52,380
of the function that sufficient whatever does i don't really care can also be something

982
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:56,660
and then there's the way that is more in the spirit of and then you

983
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,410
use the

984
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:02,490
basically the cutting plane algorithm right to generate these constraints using the the black box

985
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:09,860
argmax and the other approach would be my outputs right i can nicely decompose and

986
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:15,180
the dependencies are then only within relatively is kind of small i get relatively small

987
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:20,660
cliques and then i can use that approach and basically we palmer tries do all

988
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:25,470
and then hopefully solve the dual exactly k then i don't have to do that

989
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:29,140
constraint generation thing i consulted dual exactly

990
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:32,610
OK and these are these are basically two options that you

991
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:39,470
this is another clique so basically you know in

992
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:41,430
many independent you know

993
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:45,970
you might not always talk about the same clique right so if i have a

994
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,530
it's it's it's basically you know if i think about this sequence would have once

995
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:55,970
again another so there is a click click here see that is a pair of

996
01:00:55,970 --> 01:01:00,400
nodes and another clique here that the parents don't you might just say you don't

997
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,530
care where you see the pairs of nodes train and then you just this function

998
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:07,220
k CD which has always been the same

999
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:12,280
it only this do you will pick out the specific variables that you need on

1000
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:17,660
the other hand right so it's if i've seen whatever labelled c you know state

1001
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:18,130
one two

1002
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,470
in this sequence and one two somewhere over here

1003
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,900
right all i'm saying is basically then

1004
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:28,140
and i now have some overlap right because i found the same that that's kind

1005
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,070
of in this definition here

1006
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:34,720
the likelihood and then you get your your your solution

1007
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,800
and then use of is doing

1008
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:38,280
what you have your posterior

1009
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,320
then you're and then you're done

1010
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:42,490
but now

1011
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:45,550
what we use the posterior for well

1012
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:48,740
you can make you can use it to make predictions about what's going to happen

1013
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:49,800
in the future

1014
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:52,850
how do we do that well

1015
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:58,490
the prediction that we want make it wrong make the probability distribution over what we

1016
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:01,510
have future outcome be to start

1017
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:03,600
the random variable

1018
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:07,260
note that your

1019
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,530
you can just write that has now

1020
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:13,930
i have an interval here of the x dark high

1021
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:18,530
and you high given the that when you multiply these two conditions get together

1022
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:20,220
you get a star

1023
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,070
given the the joint probability

1024
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,490
x star

1025
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,490
given the

1026
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:30,600
and then i some out the high variables

1027
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,620
that is the probability of x target p

1028
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,100
this is exactly the thing i'm looking for i want to know

1029
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:40,200
what the observed data

1030
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,070
tell me

1031
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:44,300
about what's going to happen in the future

1032
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:49,430
note that this is not something this is not something i invented

1033
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:52,320
just writing down the thing that i want to know

1034
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,640
OK and then i can expand

1035
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,430
in this particular way

1036
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:58,740
by using the joint probability of

1037
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,430
x starring high

1038
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:01,760
given the

1039
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:05,200
that can be written in terms of product where one of the time the posterior

1040
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:10,160
you the term here is that just like your functions

1041
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,680
the probability of an observation even

1042
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:22,070
all right so that means that in in the and the thing you simply you

1043
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,450
simply work out

1044
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:27,490
the the the probability of the thing that are interested in you just use the

1045
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:29,700
rules of probability

1046
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:35,760
notice also that the that the posterior distribution

1047
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:42,390
that is the probability distribution of the thing that we that we interested in

1048
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,510
the parameters of the model is not a problem you know what data

1049
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:49,070
but the data is considered to be fixed here

1050
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:52,510
actually observed that has has a particular value

1051
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:56,620
that that we observe in like that

1052
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,490
and i think notice here is that the

1053
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:04,890
that the region here are are averages over different parts of

1054
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:07,220
but the problem with actually

1055
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,850
you actually take the prediction

1056
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,010
here and new average together

1057
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:15,260
based on how much you believe in different

1058
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,300
you might have so also

1059
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,140
they seem unlikely

1060
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,340
we have some weight in the control

1061
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:24,280
the more likely they are the way have

1062
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,050
the more likely one of the more

1063
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,780
and the one that i have problem

1064
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:31,220
we have larger weight in the simple

1065
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:35,350
but you can pull them out like even if things have to have low probability

1066
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:37,070
might still be

1067
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,680
will be the true

1068
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,510
you just had some unlucky

1069
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:45,740
observation but they should also be taken into consideration

1070
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,640
this also contract between

1071
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,470
the maximal ideal setting where you say well

1072
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:54,600
i believe that my problem has this particular value k over n

1073
01:04:54,620 --> 01:05:02,680
and i disregard all those things because they're not the most likely value

1074
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,870
OK so a little bit more to

1075
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,100
who's who

1076
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:12,510
in the in the bayesian game which is related to model selection

1077
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:16,470
so what say anything about model selection the frequencies

1078
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:17,260
i think

1079
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,300
come back to

1080
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:22,720
how you can sort of two things like model selection but innovation

1081
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:25,510
england's game it sort of it sort of

1082
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,390
it then a natural component inside the inference

1083
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:30,430
whereas in the

1084
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:31,640
frequencies setting

1085
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,390
you have to do something from the outside you have to sort of

1086
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:38,070
you have do something separate to figure out how to do

1087
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:43,950
model selection of tried to come back to that with a little example

1088
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:49,490
OK let's say we have we have two different for different interpretations of how the

1089
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:50,470
world became

1090
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,760
now we make some

1091
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,780
what makes observations and we want to know

1092
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,470
which one of these models

1093
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:59,050
is the right one of which one seems to be the most likely one

1094
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,410
given those observations

1095
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,990
it was repeated questions about

1096
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:28,300
the question is

1097
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:33,280
in a in classical music you can you can prove their properties about these estimators

1098
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,530
for example that in the limit of a

1099
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:42,030
acquiring an infinite amount of data and you have some notion of consistency you have

1100
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:43,910
she put a will be question

1101
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,630
do you know what it will because she this just

1102
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:50,590
makes the sound of a lot of very loud farts

1103
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:55,970
the person who told everyone the story with the companies yet

1104
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,950
he was very proud to be married to someone like this

1105
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:04,510
who is very proud to be married to a woman who put clear plastic wrap

1106
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:09,570
over r one person super so when the person picked up the soup and try

1107
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:12,110
to drink it went all over the person's lap

1108
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,780
pomposity had to be handled in a certain way

1109
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,510
but she and

1110
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,200
are on the outskirts of paris

1111
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:22,530
she became

1112
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:26,930
more and more the character an alcoholic and

1113
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,030
everyone would tell me that she was compulsive about getting away cigarettes

1114
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:37,280
she would at first given out individual cigarettes later in life she gave backpacks

1115
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,340
and i met a waitress

1116
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:44,070
in southern france who told me that in the early seventies should we send giving

1117
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:47,570
out entire her cigarettes to strangers

1118
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:50,630
i have no explanation for the compulsion

1119
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:52,720
only that it was part of a r

1120
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:53,760
she told you

1121
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:58,070
with the medium right in their bedroom she complained about it

1122
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:08,950
but at the same time the core was designing private he was designing publicly his incredible salvation army building

1123
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:13,090
ah which gave a great sense well into the urban poor

1124
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:15,320
but then a private house

1125
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:16,800
for the rich land

1126
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:19,070
on the coast of

1127
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:22,910
on the southern coast and france nearer to long

1128
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:24,550
i learned there

1129
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:26,410
and then demand the

1130
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,240
rich woman who commissioned this summoned him to visit

1131
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:31,950
she was furious

1132
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:34,240
because there was saying

1133
01:08:35,090 --> 01:08:36,660
one on the living room floor

1134
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:40,720
he took the training data from paris walked in

1135
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:42,510
look said

1136
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:44,450
and then do you have a clean

1137
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:47,200
piece of white paper yes

1138
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:51,300
she handed to him and he made a perfect model boat

1139
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:55,050
he put the model boat into the pool water on the floor

1140
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,050
floated around is that you see it works

1141
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:04,340
it's quite shocked and then he said look don't you never waste my time like

1142
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:08,760
that again here in engineering architecture you should have seen the way they were doing

1143
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,610
those stories it shouldn't be my problem and in fact

1144
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,360
he went to america

1145
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:20,150
are we said that he complained about the height the skyscrapers his ultimate experience with

1146
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:27,090
organism but in fact what bothered him about american skyscrapers with he saw them as

1147
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:33,910
an example of capitalist greed and competitiveness and the captain of sunlight from getting into

1148
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:38,700
people's lives as everyone tried to build the next week rather too close

1149
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:43,110
what was very well known and

1150
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:50,130
which i had the privilege and finding out after a few years of research that had been foundation

1151
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:51,880
suddenly said to me

1152
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:56,680
that you notice that for about two years i've written my bike occur

1153
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:01,570
library three or four times we don't research and now

1154
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,890
she wanted me to read some files product but

1155
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:09,390
i went into a room i was told that i could show these files to no one

1156
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:14,160
i couldn't make photocopies and i discovered incredible love letters

1157
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:19,260
between the court lucia and the woman tighter paris

1158
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:25,340
all things came from part of connecticut very near to where i grew up and

1159
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:29,970
she was the reason that he often went back to america

1160
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:32,630
it was a twenty year long romance

1161
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:33,950
tells us

1162
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:37,510
rather fantastic making a little island

1163
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:41,340
in long island sound of the connecticut short

1164
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:44,720
what player he was he went to chicago

1165
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:50,160
and the day after frank lloyd wright refused to meet him he was so upset that he

1166
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:55,320
hiring prostitutes one of whom took this picture of him with a room service

1167
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:57,390
don't understand

1168
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:03,240
this is a picture of his beloved marguerite when he left the united states

1169
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,220
very very sad to see her ashore

1170
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:07,990
in the late

1171
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,240
thirty thirties

1172
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,320
he was swimming

1173
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:19,470
yes entropy when he got into it to recognise boating accident

1174
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:26,530
you must create his letters about this accident he wrote his mother the most meticulous

1175
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:33,410
description of the surgery and he describes the accident as if it's an architectural detail

1176
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,070
why go underneath the boat

1177
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:42,280
how he did the propellers how his name was practically severed why the boat

1178
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:43,970
which was a yard

1179
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:50,090
didn't turn around because they're rich obnoxious people but only humble fisherman stopped for him

1180
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:54,380
there are always low enough so that they could pull them on board and then

1181
01:11:54,380 --> 01:12:00,200
about the wonderful treatment he got in the central state hospital and how the nurse

1182
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:01,820
who brought flowers every day

1183
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,130
and dropped him with rubbing alcohol

1184
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,340
which is the essence of what human being should be

1185
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:13,680
here he is with his car that he was quite right after the accident when

1186
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:19,200
he was in these act painting murals all over the house violin great

1187
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:22,340
without the authorization act

1188
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,510
are widely available in southern france

1189
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:27,840
on the roof in switzerland

1190
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,090
this to me

1191
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:33,780
the hardest part of his life to come to grips with it

1192
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,760
i discovered that for two years

1193
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,660
time and again he wrote letters

1194
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:40,720
from these she

1195
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:44,340
this is the only photograph corbusier

1196
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,650
at these

1197
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:49,380
he made every effort to work with ten

1198
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:51,970
his mother referred to whereas

1199
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:57,380
came as look on polish all the man who would save france

1200
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:00,820
in nineteen forty two

1201
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:07,740
he stopped working with attended by nineteen forty five he was changing charles two goals hair

1202
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,380
even reading the dates of the architects

1203
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:16,610
from here who are in his office

1204
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:21,990
i was thinking about the office closed in the beginning the war was involved in

1205
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:25,280
getting it reopened with the information out

1206
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:27,930
the he she authorities

1207
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:30,740
right so you have some over the vertices

1208
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:35,370
of an expectation under the marginal whatever function you have at that node

1209
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:37,390
and you have sum over edges

1210
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:40,510
an expectation over the joint distribution

1211
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:52,180
on the edge of whatever function you have on that edge

1212
01:13:52,180 --> 01:14:10,320
OK so what i was saying before is what we actually have is general family

1213
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,530
of entropy like functions

1214
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:16,300
and this parameterized by what way to put here

1215
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:19,050
if you put weights all equal to one

1216
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:24,110
you get something that's called the beta entropy that's well it's implicitly in the work

1217
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:28,860
of hans from nineteen thirty five but the inside of yedidia freeman and y sin

1218
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:33,220
roughly two thousand was to recognise that there was a connection to belief propagation

1219
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:38,240
so that's well derive in a minute but i'm going actually derive the connection and

1220
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,130
more generally for any choice of these weights

1221
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:45,760
and the reason that's interesting is because when you put all one here

1222
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:49,990
you get a function that's neither concave or convex it's very hard if it is

1223
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:54,180
very hard to say what it is on a tree it's good it's concave

1224
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,820
but the many have cycle funny things can happen

1225
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:01,430
however if you use weights that have been derived in these ways that i was

1226
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:08,010
describing for instance by taking convex combinations of trees you always produce entropy is concave

1227
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:12,490
and because of that the optimisation problem and the derived it's called the bay problem

1228
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:14,510
will always have unique optimum

1229
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,820
and you can make algorithms converge to that optimum

1230
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,840
belief propagation because it's an on

1231
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:27,490
well non concave maximisation are known generically non convex problem you can't say anything about

1232
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:32,360
you know whether you're getting max or local object so that's that's the advantage of

1233
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,220
convexity in general

1234
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:40,640
OK so

1235
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,470
you've got two pieces so this average energy you sort of thinking this is the

1236
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:48,220
function when optimizing over these marginals those are what's varying

1237
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:51,240
it's the function of the marginals

1238
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:54,390
the data is that came from your problem that's

1239
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:58,700
fixed by your data set function of the marginals we're going to do is optimized

1240
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:04,430
it is the sum of these two or the difference

1241
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:07,140
very bad with signs

1242
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:08,200
and optimize

1243
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,300
the sum of the difference evidence it's going to be positive weight on this and

1244
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,470
we're going to do it exactly over that set of constraints that we've been talking

1245
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:18,820
about over that local marginal polytope

1246
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:23,550
and because of that the messages in some product organ and i've been like

1247
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:28,340
the branch multipliers again i in this case i'm going work through the derivation with

1248
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:33,300
you because it's nice alexis size and lagrangian duality

1249
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:36,260
didn't even talk about the origin duality

1250
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:39,410
OK so so i want to use the writings and things like that

1251
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:45,490
OK so the problem that we're going to consider is

1252
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:55,260
this function that defined

1253
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:11,630
OK so i'm not going to reiterate the functions in shorthand but all we can

1254
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:15,640
refer back to them when we get going on the derivation so we're going to

1255
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:20,990
do is i'm going to maximize a maximizing overall these

1256
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:25,280
marginal distributions one for every node one for every edge

1257
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,510
and i'm going to maximize

1258
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:33,090
the term that involves the beer entropy

1259
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:34,680
the term

1260
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:41,640
which way is it

1261
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:44,450
minus entropy and it should be plus

1262
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:46,930
right so

1263
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:51,910
we now also consider elaborated picture recently introduced and

1264
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:57,710
the first come to it is so i will probably actually multiclass problems data storage

1265
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:04,910
is given you is first of all we had well separated by class classification problem

1266
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:09,570
then introduce support for you can map to this high dimensional feature space is the

1267
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:11,180
data is mashed together

1268
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:16,000
of course many real world problems you have many classes on come on to that

1269
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,680
but only briefly

1270
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:20,760
another thing of course is i mentioned just now that you may have a data

1271
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:25,110
point which is well away from the rest of the data

1272
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:29,620
it could be just a correct point but rather unusual or it could be an

1273
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:35,140
what i wanna do is avoid the influence of outliers so then i will introduce

1274
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:36,970
this idea the soft margin

1275
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:42,050
which are added some knows this morning just to make it more formal then we'll

1276
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:45,470
move on to other things like regression OK

1277
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:46,470
the first of all

1278
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:52,670
many problems involve multiple classes and we have to have a means of handling this

1279
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:57,030
and if there are a number of schemes for multiclass classification using SVM

1280
01:18:57,030 --> 01:19:01,260
svm nicely set up bond classification we've seen that picture

1281
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:07,870
leeds quite nicely to a convex optimization problem and also welcome set up for multiclass

1282
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:08,920
to be honest

1283
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:14,000
and there are indeed a number schemes for tackling

1284
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:23,090
and i imagine it just can give you one will be the ideal introduced was

1285
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:27,090
actually done by nello cristianini and john platt

1286
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:30,920
so we years ago in and it's paper OK

1287
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:35,470
now so the schema give you will actually handle small

1288
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:39,260
if you have a small number of classes perhaps six of them then it should

1289
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:40,590
be OK

1290
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:43,170
now i did introduce the idea of

1291
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:46,480
have introduced how you do an SVM for binary class

1292
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:49,230
one of gasification two classes

1293
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:52,640
indeed if i have done that then i can actually handle three four

1294
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:56,410
o five class relatively straightforward and the idea

1295
01:19:56,420 --> 01:20:00,830
and i'll give you is directed a cyclic graph and

1296
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:07,200
the the principal is as follows suppose fact have three classes one to three

1297
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,660
and what i do is i make a decision

1298
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,830
is it o one or three

1299
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:14,330
suppose i find this one

1300
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:16,730
i made the decision is one or two

1301
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:19,300
suppose i find one then this one

1302
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,510
here is the two i go to two

1303
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,800
and similarly if i decided the three here

1304
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:25,800
again go down the other branch

1305
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:29,950
now what you see from this is that each step here

1306
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,040
it's simply binary classification

1307
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:32,890
and indeed

1308
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:37,630
then the story of gatekeeping gave in the previous lecture for binary classification just supplies

1309
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:41,190
so you can actually do binary classification this way

1310
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:44,920
coded this up and it worked OK in practice

1311
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,990
one of the automatically notice k is that

1312
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:52,440
if five and a large number classes perhaps a couple hundred is going to be

1313
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:53,450
a big tree

1314
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:54,800
there's not a good idea

1315
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:58,230
if god of the classes but first one of the classes OK

1316
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,950
and easily connect with the binary classification

1317
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:03,290
the they introduced earlier on

1318
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,550
if you have many classes

1319
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:08,830
quite honestly i would probably use an SVM but

1320
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:14,450
what many people do is simply one against all classification

1321
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:18,230
there have been other attempts to do it more elegantly

1322
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,460
but to my knowledge

1323
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,320
and none of them are really being

1324
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:25,050
outperforming one against all

1325
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:30,390
so one against all will be simply do one against all the other classes OK

1326
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:34,420
so that's how i might approach it as i say

1327
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:40,170
but the classification of small number classes streams are very nice

1328
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:45,540
if you're talking about several hundred classes might be tempted to use other methods are

1329
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:52,950
perhaps marjoram is a multinomial probit model or or suchlike

1330
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:58,170
but this is how much do multiclass for one of the classes as long going

1331
01:21:58,170 --> 01:22:01,450
to say about multiclass so got a lot of the things to cover

1332
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:09,580
the newspaper is just as essential idea around about

1333
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:12,970
two thousand NIPS two-thousand

1334
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:14,900
giving this

1335
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:20,370
yes does it and it did number experiments and induce the theorem as well

1336
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:27,330
each of these is just a straight binary

1337
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,590
as introduced this morning

1338
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:38,280
right that's what saying on multiclass they want to come onto is soft margins now

1339
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:39,680
we've already had

1340
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:43,780
when she says picture this morning of two classes OK

1341
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:48,260
i had this and nicely separated data

1342
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:56,010
my hyperplane was light so well life is not like that and generality and my

1343
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:58,760
i have a guy here

1344
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:01,390
perhaps open here

1345
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:03,740
OK and indeed what he would do

1346
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,080
is he would tend to push

1347
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:09,450
the hyperplane into unusual orientation OK

1348
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:12,330
indeed it would now be something like this

1349
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,530
from saying is

1350
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:21,750
points could have undue influence on the separating hyperplane i said earlier in fact how

1351
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:26,760
that feature is as they have actually large alpha values being in really quite significant

1352
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:27,730
job demand

1353
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:31,330
that i could ever remember in my life right

1354
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,950
companies are dying to get their hands

1355
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:35,970
on on big data people

1356
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:40,180
on data analysis people on data mining people and this includes banks

1357
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:41,270
tell close

1358
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:42,910
insurance companies

1359
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:48,120
you name so i think you notice and i agree completely with all and this is not trying

1360
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:54,770
ok yeah so

1361
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:58,370
before we have two perspectives talk about your first or

1362
01:23:58,590 --> 01:24:01,570
the first of the two right

1363
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:06,500
you tells like getting hired to link then that as me a river pretty big

1364
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,810
startup startup never nevertheless

1365
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:09,740
yeah that's right

1366
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:14,720
so it was the beginning of two thousand and nine it was kind of

1367
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:17,010
preheat stereo data science i guess

1368
01:24:17,490 --> 01:24:22,780
and i was approached by a small company name that phase book and they ask

1369
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:26,520
me they they said that there are more building data team

1370
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:30,470
and that they were looking for people my profile to kind of

1371
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:32,150
the the the senior

1372
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:33,540
person on the team

1373
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:37,480
and my i actually

1374
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:40,040
my response was know like you know it's

1375
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:46,800
it's a small company it's a it's trying to by teenagers pretty much ok and

1376
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:51,940
yeah and actually i wasn't phase look at that time i kind of even

1377
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,750
connect myself to the value proposition phrase book

1378
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:59,150
but that opened my mind to questions like that so

1379
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:02,600
it's obviously to it's obvious that you know

1380
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:05,450
social networks

1381
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:09,670
war future at that point now it's like you know the our

1382
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:10,790
everyday life

1383
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:18,680
and i actually was really connected to value proposition of in matter social network

1384
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:21,260
to the value proposition of

1385
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:28,540
keeping your professional connections and knowing about what's going on the field and finding a job if you need

1386
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,280
so i ii

1387
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,530
i wanted to work for link team

1388
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,280
was very surprising null link people are well connected

1389
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,150
but id know anyone that

1390
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,100
i linked game

1391
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:43,730
so i basically went to their carrier side an applied

1392
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:49,780
that's what idea and i got to me that and three years later right actually

1393
01:25:50,190 --> 01:25:54,610
well i decided to move back home to israel and it's a different story

1394
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,910
we talked about this so so that you have an opinion on whether it's better

1395
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:03,780
write a

1396
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:09,370
hindsight is twenty twenty look like if it had been facebook you enjoyed it but let's just generalize

1397
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:10,120
you know to say

1398
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,730
what you think about joining a company

1399
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,970
is still preoccupy all still very much startup

1400
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:17,390
but is established

1401
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:25,060
versus starting a very small early stage are early stage star you have an

1402
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:25,700
opinion on

1403
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,950
this for you which one of those as prefer

1404
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:36,620
yeah i do actually i think so we can kind of to make some type of calculation right so

1405
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:37,900
i think that

1406
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:42,290
the it's very hard to optimize our life right but say

1407
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:43,630
if we want to

1408
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:48,270
do some very interesting job and also optimise for making money after all

1409
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:55,460
so the function the objective function that we probably would optimize something like reward multiplied by the probability of getting

1410
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,460
there's a war right

1411
01:26:56,790 --> 01:27:00,630
and and if you have this this function you basically

1412
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:06,260
weak we can i say look at both sides like say are optimising for reward

1413
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,910
right we want to get the biggest reward probably

1414
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:10,950
a lower probability of getting a

1415
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:16,760
best definitely to found the company right if l let's try to do i'm i'm i'm

1416
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:18,680
trying to make a model just

1417
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:19,730
on the fly

1418
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:22,630
which is that if you find the company

1419
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:26,020
and it's a successful company you can make something like that

1420
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:27,300
down to

1421
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:30,390
what's likely to happen when it performs an action

1422
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:35,790
and from the characteristic function can compute expectation

1423
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:44,940
not our expectation is have what the utility is with expected utility is

1424
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:50,050
what's funny is that well

1425
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:02,970
well one can can try and what is it

1426
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:04,850
is the concept of

1427
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:07,230
of information that one can community which

1428
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,310
gives you some

1429
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,770
what you should try and do

1430
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:14,730
in order to get the best information order to act

1431
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,660
so there are

1432
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:19,880
there are two things one can do to try and get the best possible result

1433
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:22,290
if you don't know very much

1434
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,270
some things may be much better to do than others

1435
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:27,710
and to have much idea but you may have a little bit of an idea

1436
01:28:27,710 --> 01:28:30,060
that was the best thing to do

1437
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:35,240
right so

1438
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:40,210
the distinction between rationality and science

1439
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:42,180
so you know since

1440
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:45,970
you know what's going to happen

1441
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:48,420
and if the nineteen seventy and

1442
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:49,300
it wouldn't be

1443
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:52,760
maximizing expected utility

1444
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:56,960
because it because and i was going to happen to be maximizing utility

1445
01:28:56,970 --> 01:29:03,450
so the difference between the main difference between rationality and this is the expectation

1446
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:07,040
but the course i didn't and the sea and so we we have no real

1447
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:10,470
way of achieving that no or we in fact

1448
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:16,520
the point here is that the rationality

1449
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:20,610
and you can be rational still get into trouble

1450
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:24,610
and it's an example of such a thing that can happen

1451
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:27,930
you walking along the street

1452
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:30,270
and you see a friend on the other side of the road

1453
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,250
and you can see that there are no cars

1454
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:34,530
and you will start to walk across the street

1455
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:37,370
the comet your friends

1456
01:29:37,450 --> 01:29:39,060
the rational thing to do

1457
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:41,930
because of the different cars quite safe

1458
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:44,140
there's a lot going across the top

1459
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,730
this case was this form of

1460
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:51,730
right so that i just wasn't missy otherwise damage did

1461
01:29:51,770 --> 01:29:53,990
they behave rationally

1462
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,270
according to some reasonable definition

1463
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:57,440
mesh well

1464
01:29:57,470 --> 01:30:01,860
couldn't resist performs recent definition of performance measure

1465
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:04,880
so things may still go wrong but it can still be rational factors and can

1466
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,210
happen to him human course

1467
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,430
well autonomy

1468
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,890
we expect these ideas to be

1469
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,520
autonomous autonomous

1470
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:19,110
to a large degree

1471
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:20,780
effective autonomous the better

1472
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:22,580
the ideal thing would be to

1473
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:28,280
but i just was environment that lot of the performance measure the list

1474
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:29,790
the typically

1475
01:30:30,530 --> 01:30:33,720
the agent designer has to do a lot of knowledge in

1476
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:36,080
at the beginning

1477
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:37,560
in fact it's one of the

1478
01:30:37,570 --> 01:30:40,200
the biggest problems at the moment you have to do so much and it's very

1479
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,300
hard to get very far

1480
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:45,860
so we want to be able to act autonomously decide what's the best thing to

1481
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,720
given a performance measure

1482
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:50,340
and act accordingly

1483
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,090
and we really want

1484
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:54,970
i just to learn

1485
01:30:55,010 --> 01:30:58,440
this is a really key idea in fact this is

1486
01:30:58,490 --> 01:31:01,110
in my view

1487
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:04,760
the most important problem to solve

1488
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:06,520
if we could find a way

1489
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:11,370
of creating edges that could learn their environment

1490
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:14,180
we can do that i could design and architecture

1491
01:31:14,230 --> 01:31:16,670
is sufficiently flexible and powerful enough

1492
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:22,060
i think that the listening environment deployed in the learning

1493
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,710
then we have effectively so much of the problem in fact this is the way

1494
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:27,560
humans work

1495
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:30,530
humans are programmed

1496
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:33,380
they come with an airborne they can with a certain

1497
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:36,040
basic architecture

1498
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:38,630
in fact the brain it's got everything connected

1499
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,030
pretty much

1500
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:45,430
as a child goes through study part of his life

1501
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,920
and experience is different things

1502
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:50,780
connections in the brain change

1503
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:53,800
and they get taught by their parents to get all the people they watch and

1504
01:31:57,410 --> 01:32:00,730
and eventually become capable of many things

1505
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:02,520
that's a good analogy

1506
01:32:02,570 --> 01:32:04,750
what you want to do is build items

1507
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:07,970
got an architecture that is capable of doing that

1508
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:08,750
in fact

1509
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:12,210
you can reduce the problem to that response is capable of doing it finished

1510
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:13,290
everything else follows

1511
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:17,520
give my enthusiasm

1512
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:20,280
you don't want to have

1513
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:24,170
three particular application the agent designer

1514
01:32:24,170 --> 01:32:28,590
putting in detail information about that particular application

1515
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:31,600
what you want is the generic architecture

1516
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:36,170
it's an architecture that can work in number different environments

1517
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:38,620
it has got enough built in

1518
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:42,260
and mechanisms to learn to adapt

1519
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:44,140
so they can be trained

1520
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,450
you can learn from this environment to deploy

1521
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,730
it does something that you can tell it was bad and so on and so

1522
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,060
and eventually it's able to

1523
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:58,160
i very well exactly the way humans to

1524
01:32:58,270 --> 01:33:01,330
right task environment

1525
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:03,200
so let me just introduce them

1526
01:33:03,230 --> 01:33:05,540
really is terminology so this

1527
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:10,060
two pages of this system terms should be aware of

1528
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:11,330
the first one

1529
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:17,140
so in a fully observable environment

1530
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:18,790
from the percept

1531
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:23,270
the agent knows exactly what the environment looks like

1532
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:26,090
and there are some simple cases

1533
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:29,520
such situations

1534
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:32,980
and typically example would be

1535
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:36,460
so playing chess

1536
01:33:36,530 --> 01:33:38,780
you can observe the chessboard

1537
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:40,320
and from that percept

1538
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:41,480
you know

1539
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:45,070
everything about the game actually is not completely true

1540
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,420
x thirty

1541
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:48,170
one of feature

1542
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:51,420
because they

1543
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:54,210
this is a good place to start counting

1544
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:58,840
history but anyway it's time point roughly speaking the chessboard

1545
01:33:58,860 --> 01:33:59,940
that's good

1546
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:02,240
much like this is modified

1547
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:04,970
it's it's fully observable

1548
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:09,780
partially observable means that this things going on the perceptron tell you about

1549
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:12,070
that's the typical situation

1550
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:14,360
deterministic versus stochastic

1551
01:34:14,370 --> 01:34:16,910
so in deterministic

1552
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:21,910
the next states completely determined by the current state

1553
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:25,180
and the action to perform

1554
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:27,350
so there's no probability distribution you

1555
01:34:27,410 --> 01:34:32,340
the next states completely determined

1556
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:35,180
OK good morning and thank you for

1557
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,840
very kind remark

1558
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:39,050
the younger

1559
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,510
learning and told you the subject is supposed to cover today

1560
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:44,670
it's the memory

1561
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:47,290
i put up here

1562
01:34:47,310 --> 01:34:49,760
neurobiology memory

1563
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:51,810
how do we acquire

1564
01:34:51,810 --> 01:34:54,470
information from experience

1565
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:55,290
how to

1566
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:57,060
consolidate it

1567
01:34:57,060 --> 01:35:00,240
also how to retrieve it

1568
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:02,640
i'm also

1569
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:08,920
director of this MIT's center called The Picower Center for learning and memory

1570
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:10,500
so this centre is now

1571
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:13,410
eleven faculty members many of them

1572
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:18,490
lecturers in this course in the DB

1573
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:21,180
in fact even [unclear] is a member of the Picower center

1574
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:24,590
Marc Bear, Earl Miller

1575
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,360
and so on

1576
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:35,490
i want to go back to step back a little bit

1577
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:38,490
this is ninety three

1578
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:43,810
if the fifteenth anniversary of the discovery of the DNA double helix

1579
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:47,550
and what

1580
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:49,030
so there has been

1581
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:53,060
many celebrations going on throughout the world

1582
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,940
this is really in

1583
01:35:57,750 --> 01:36:02,140
what is called the molecular biology nineteen fifty three

1584
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:05,160
and we come a long way obviously fifty years

1585
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:11,110
from posterior year to the

1586
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,940
completion of the focal human

1587
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:18,330
genome project has been announced

1588
01:36:18,350 --> 01:36:19,640
and we now know

1589
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:20,920
the entire

1590
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:23,140
nearly entire sequence

1591
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:27,160
all bar about thirty thousand genes there

1592
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:29,160
human being has

1593
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,300
now the human genome project also

1594
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:34,330
extended to other

1595
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:39,510
species such as the chimp models

1596
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,390
four try

1597
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:44,830
and brown wall while c elegans

1598
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:49,520
and you can see here the the approximate number of genes while

1599
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:50,520
and also

1600
01:36:51,370 --> 01:36:54,290
DNA sequence similarities

1601
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:02,270
between one of these non-human species human well humans

1602
01:37:02,290 --> 01:37:08,640
as shown in here we have whatever their race is we've belong to

1603
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:13,360
we at least ninety nine ninety nine point nine percent seven was

1604
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:18,010
a brute force is also

1605
01:37:18,110 --> 01:37:24,800
we even very similar to chain ninety nine percent twenty one percent

1606
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:37,900
this is a similarity in colder regions and called

1607
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:39,960
the areas which is known to

1608
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,240
called approach

1609
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:42,680
and therefore

1610
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:45,670
one meaningful for the function

1611
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:50,210
that although it looks similar

1612
01:37:50,230 --> 01:37:54,360
most of these communities are manifested by

1613
01:37:54,430 --> 01:37:56,710
what what one might call

1614
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:58,490
physical features

1615
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:03,550
the way we

1616
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:07,330
this is entire organs however internal organ functions

1617
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:09,340
how the immune system works

1618
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:11,960
those things

1619
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:14,520
very similar between

1620
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:16,050
three species of mammals

1621
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:19,930
i wrote road gritting roads and as

1622
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:23,830
in got involved in some of the wants better than human beings

1623
01:38:23,890 --> 01:38:25,730
nevertheless we dominate

1624
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:29,020
the planet

1625
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:32,270
because i one

1626
01:38:32,290 --> 01:38:36,550
the other half of a function with the mind function

1627
01:38:37,270 --> 01:38:40,680
much more superior to any other species

1628
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:46,340
in terms of understanding

1629
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:50,720
mechanism in general

1630
01:38:52,850 --> 01:38:54,590
it's my mental

1631
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:59,200
there has been

1632
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:03,200
interesting views on the history

1633
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:07,560
so this is a picture of an attack on french seventeenth century

1634
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:14,820
he view

1635
01:39:14,890 --> 01:39:16,510
well we can

1636
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:18,090
this kind of my

1637
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:23,590
by i and by natural science

1638
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:25,100
is sort of

1639
01:39:25,150 --> 01:39:28,200
summarized in this wonderful paragraph

1640
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:31,530
so he said people with the bodies

1641
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:36,850
like machine capable of being studied by the mass of the the physical sciences physical

1642
01:39:36,850 --> 01:39:39,450
sciences with the natural sciences

1643
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,270
but the full

1644
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:43,260
by source also

1645
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:45,010
but that's OK that's fine

1646
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:48,370
so i i basically built the likelihood is going to be just the product of

1647
01:39:48,370 --> 01:39:54,090
these things and then finally this is the quantity that i want to maximize OK

1648
01:39:54,110 --> 01:39:59,190
so let's just do that

1649
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:01,410
right now is one one

1650
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:03,840
pulls up his sleeves and the

1651
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:06,520
goes for all right

1652
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:08,360
for convenience

1653
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:12,460
let's just say this is defined the concept of parameters OK

1654
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:17,680
OK so we first we first take derivatives with respect to the means and the

1655
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:21,530
same as we leave the pie case for later the reason is the phi kz

1656
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:22,860
little bit trickier

1657
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:27,380
because we're can now take derivatives back to them but we know one thing

1658
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:31,570
we know that the sum of the pie case for k goes from one to

1659
01:40:31,570 --> 01:40:34,130
capital k has to be equal to one right

1660
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:36,640
so that means that we have to be a little bit careful here we take

1661
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:40,910
derivatives so what is it that we need to do

1662
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:44,730
exactly we to the lagrange multiplier OK but

1663
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:47,390
we're not going to do that on this slide with that in the next slide

1664
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:48,710
or or two OK

1665
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:50,840
OK fair enough let's now say

1666
01:40:50,870 --> 01:40:55,070
let's just call generic name theta for the things want to want to take derivatives

1667
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:58,550
with respect to just make it simpler and see how how it's going to be

1668
01:40:58,550 --> 01:41:03,180
OK OK so we want to take the derivative of this with respect to theta

1669
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:05,030
far enough what do we get

1670
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:05,910
we have

1671
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,230
some outside over the data points and then we have the logarithm of something OK

1672
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:14,280
OK so we can see that the sum outside is going to stay

1673
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,340
and then we're going to get

1674
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:19,890
you know the derivative of the logarithm chain rule so we get one over the

1675
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:25,600
and then we get the derivative of what was inside the logarithm with respect to

1676
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,060
expected to write a c

1677
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:31,270
this state is this by k here

1678
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,670
and stick it together in here then you can really see that this is what

1679
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:35,840
was inside

1680
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:41,880
inside the this the songwriting so the terms of the sun

1681
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:43,250
and now

1682
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:48,100
so why why did this some disappear that's because we're taking derivatives with respect to

1683
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:51,550
the parameters of the case gaussians OK

1684
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:55,920
so we need to go and pick a specific goals in since it refers to

1685
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:00,200
things that are specific to girls right the mean and covariance of the case component

1686
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:02,840
so that means that

1687
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:05,890
once to have one over the whole thing then when i take the derivative of

1688
01:42:05,890 --> 01:42:10,340
what's inside the logarithm with the decay of this some i only need the corresponding

1689
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:14,300
element OK the others the gas only then that mean and covariance

1690
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:19,250
for now now i can take the pike k i can take it outside because

1691
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:23,330
because by k doesn't depend on the mean or the variance right so i'm left

1692
01:42:23,330 --> 01:42:25,550
with this expression here

1693
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:29,980
and i'm left with expression and i'm very happy because i'm taking the derivative of

1694
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:31,650
the gaussians to remember

1695
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:34,780
PIK is is the gaussians in right

1696
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:37,890
with respect to its parameters and i don't like that i i i like taking

1697
01:42:37,890 --> 01:42:41,180
derivatives of of logarithms of gaussians

1698
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,840
but that's OK and now

1699
01:42:42,850 --> 01:42:44,840
this is one of those moments where

1700
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:47,300
you're doing your ratings and all of the sudden

1701
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:49,250
magic happens

1702
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:51,340
so how does magic happens

1703
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:53,360
well use sort of

1704
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:56,510
he sort of think about it a little bit

1705
01:42:56,550 --> 01:43:00,670
and then you remember a good old the rule of calculus you sort of remember

1706
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:05,270
so it is written that abraham just right gonna rise again so if i have

1707
01:43:05,270 --> 01:43:07,420
a certain function

1708
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:08,590
and i take

1709
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:11,410
the derivative of this function

1710
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:12,600
i know

1711
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,370
that this is equal

1712
01:43:14,380 --> 01:43:15,950
two f of x

1713
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:19,810
times the derivative of the logarithm of f

1714
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:23,800
with respect to x right

1715
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:24,430
and so

1716
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:25,870
since i wanted to take

1717
01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:28,230
the motives of the logarithm of mikkelsen

1718
01:43:28,230 --> 01:43:29,430
not just do that

1719
01:43:29,450 --> 01:43:32,550
and then i think of it i'm gonna now i'm going to have this term

1720
01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:34,500
that that comes out

1721
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:35,960
that's actually a miracle

1722
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:38,060
it's fantastic to get that out

1723
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:39,460
now why is that

1724
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:44,600
it's fantastic because now this guy comes out and all of the sudden

1725
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:46,070
this term here

1726
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:49,640
has a meaning

1727
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:52,190
it has a very very clear meaning

1728
01:43:52,210 --> 01:43:54,600
now what's that

1729
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:56,030
let's think about it

1730
01:43:56,070 --> 01:43:57,110
one was

1731
01:43:57,170 --> 01:43:58,550
pi of k

1732
01:43:58,550 --> 01:44:00,090
by of k was

1733
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:04,580
right supply of k was the prior probability

1734
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:09,280
that's an indicator variables any of them was going to be equal to k

1735
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:11,280
and what was pi

1736
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:13,510
i k

1737
01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:14,900
well i k

1738
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:17,860
was the probability of the data points

1739
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:24,780
the indicator variables was k but what this is saying is is the pretty of

1740
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:28,150
why i given that i have chosen the case goes in

1741
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:31,190
but now

1742
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:35,370
what can i do now when i can compute the posterior distribution that can compute

1743
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:37,790
the posterior

1744
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:40,370
why i what now is

1745
01:44:40,430 --> 01:44:41,860
the probability

1746
01:44:42,030 --> 01:44:48,010
one the probability that that the i th data points

1747
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:51,040
belongs to to to the to the component

1748
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:57,110
once once of seen and given given this two things so it's going to be

1749
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:59,340
according to pi k

1750
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:00,910
i i k

1751
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:03,490
but now what did we learn about computing posteriors

1752
01:45:03,490 --> 01:45:06,130
we will learn that we need to renormalize right

1753
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:10,270
because now this thing is not going to add up to one and how does

1754
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:13,040
it in which space should this add up to one one should add up to

1755
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,010
of s

1756
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,700
divided by road

1757
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:19,350
which is now

1758
01:45:21,430 --> 01:45:26,160
to the square root of one of the land

1759
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:28,510
not have reversed

1760
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:33,760
so now we see that the larger the wavelengths the smaller the phase velocity

1761
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:37,200
none of this of course is intuitive you have no feeling for that i have

1762
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,180
no feeling for that

1763
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:42,470
what i'm asking you in problem set number six

1764
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:44,790
it is to prove that in this case

1765
01:45:44,830 --> 01:45:48,600
the group velocity is one and half times the phase velocity

1766
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,990
not all but that's what will come out

1767
01:45:51,370 --> 01:45:54,810
the group velocity was half the phase velocity

1768
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:58,810
and the phase of the phase velocity

1769
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:02,620
was larger for larger wavelength here it is reversed

1770
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:08,720
and the group velocity is one-and-a-half times the face falls

1771
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:13,510
shallow waterways which is also part of the problem set and on this person not

1772
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:14,810
so intuitive

1773
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:17,200
so if very shallow

1774
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:20,100
what are weights which means than that

1775
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:22,470
the amount of water that you have

1776
01:46:22,510 --> 01:46:26,530
the height of the water is substantially lower than the wavelength

1777
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:34,160
then you get non dispersive relation which is not always easy to of course

1778
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,660
in this room

1779
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:39,660
it is not this person

1780
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:40,540
thank you

1781
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:44,810
imagine for a minute that the high frequency

1782
01:46:44,830 --> 01:46:49,180
will travel was substantially higher speed my low frequencies

1783
01:46:49,270 --> 01:46:52,560
then only the people in france you knew what i was saying in the one

1784
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,910
in that had no clue

1785
01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:59,240
because the higher frequencies might arrive much earlier than the low frequencies

1786
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:00,200
you could not

1787
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:02,100
make sense of what i'm saying

1788
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,200
imagine you go to a concert

1789
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:05,390
if there were

1790
01:47:05,410 --> 01:47:08,030
it sounds very dispersive

1791
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:12,240
you have to pay a very high price for the tickets in the front row

1792
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:15,370
and the tickets in the balcony they would give them away for free because you

1793
01:47:15,370 --> 01:47:18,010
would have no clue what you're listening at any

1794
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:20,490
because the different frequencies of the violins

1795
01:47:20,510 --> 01:47:21,680
and of the base

1796
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:23,890
what reach you at different times

1797
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:26,040
so we are fortunate that sound

1798
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:32,950
in this lecture hall is known this person

1799
01:47:32,990 --> 01:47:35,220
the next lecture

1800
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:39,350
we will and the domain of electromagnetic waves

1801
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:40,350
in other words

1802
01:47:40,370 --> 01:47:43,810
you're going to love it you're going to see maxwell's equations

1803
01:47:43,970 --> 01:47:48,530
i know you love maxwell's equations you remember it to the good old days

1804
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:52,080
and we will we will derive using maxwell's equations

1805
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:57,560
that there is such a thing as electromagnetic waves and that they move in vacuum

1806
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:01,950
with the speed which we call seen in physics which is three hundred thousand kilometres

1807
01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:03,310
per second

1808
01:48:03,350 --> 01:48:07,310
that can actually be derived

1809
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:09,510
so in free space

1810
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:11,660
that means in vacuum

1811
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:16,660
electromagnetic waves

1812
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:18,770
i know this person

1813
01:48:19,890 --> 01:48:23,010
call c timescale

1814
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:25,510
and on the specific relationship

1815
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:26,910
so to frequency

1816
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:28,620
or electromagnetic waves

1817
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:34,660
it's a discrete of light defined by lambda

1818
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:38,890
and so we will encounter was eight o three radio waves

1819
01:48:38,950 --> 01:48:41,770
and we will actually produced

1820
01:48:41,830 --> 01:48:48,060
and let's say we take a frequency of about one megahertz

1821
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,200
thirty six hertz

1822
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:52,450
that will give you a wavelengths

1823
01:48:52,510 --> 01:48:54,770
of about three hundred metres

1824
01:48:54,830 --> 01:48:59,030
you can use this equation

1825
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:02,030
if we go to radar

1826
01:49:02,030 --> 01:49:04,510
which we have right here in front of us

1827
01:49:04,540 --> 01:49:07,850
the frequency is about ten gigahertz

1828
01:49:07,970 --> 01:49:09,620
to to ten hertz

1829
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:11,370
so we have wavelength

1830
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:14,600
of about three centimetres

1831
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:18,310
and if you go to infrared radiation UV wavelength

1832
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:20,970
of tens of microns

1833
01:49:21,060 --> 01:49:22,850
and if you go to visible light

1834
01:49:22,850 --> 01:49:26,990
you get frequencies up to five times ten to fourteen words

1835
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,410
you get wavelengths of about half a micron

1836
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:34,620
when you go to ultraviolet and x-rays gonna raise the frequencies go higher and higher

1837
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:38,580
and the wavelength gets shorter and shorter

1838
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:40,560
non dispersive

1839
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,260
in vacuum all

1840
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:49,790
exactly the same speed

1841
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:52,140
light in glass

1842
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:54,310
or in water for that matter

1843
01:49:54,330 --> 01:49:56,600
it's not known this person

1844
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:59,010
it is very dispersed

1845
01:49:59,030 --> 01:50:00,910
as we will derive

1846
01:50:00,970 --> 01:50:03,350
in all three

1847
01:50:05,540 --> 01:50:08,540
speed of electromagnetic radiation

1848
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:09,810
this seems

1849
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:11,990
divided by the square root

1850
01:50:11,990 --> 01:50:14,830
of the dielectric constant kappa e

1851
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:15,910
and the

1852
01:50:15,970 --> 01:50:18,640
relative permeability kappa and

1853
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:21,740
which may or may not recognise from your eight two days

1854
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,660
and in vacuum

1855
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:25,510
this is one

1856
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:28,310
and this is one

1857
01:50:28,390 --> 01:50:30,510
but that's not the case

1858
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:32,660
four water and that's not the case

1859
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:34,330
four class

1860
01:50:34,370 --> 01:50:35,510
and in fact

1861
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:42,220
that he e is strongly frequency dependent

1862
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:45,910
so if i take water

1863
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:47,040
as an example

1864
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,850
four its kappa and

1865
01:50:48,870 --> 01:50:51,450
it's very close to one because what is not

1866
01:50:51,470 --> 01:50:55,410
ferromagnetic materials and all materials that are not ferromagnetic

1867
01:50:55,410 --> 01:50:56,800
in some direction

1868
01:50:56,820 --> 01:51:01,430
and the environment for you will be able to

1869
01:51:01,430 --> 01:51:05,030
so roughly speaking if you're working in a regime where

1870
01:51:05,050 --> 01:51:10,740
once you find a decent random variables completely determined that almost all fully observed learning

1871
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:15,550
and then you might want to job almost optimal if you're rich you have a

1872
01:51:15,550 --> 01:51:21,970
lot of the neighbouring variables even given the parameters that you need very should you

1873
01:51:22,030 --> 01:51:25,330
take the first or second

1874
01:51:32,430 --> 01:51:41,870
o point eight slice let's try and consider the other places so for mixture models

1875
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:43,870
was for discrete

1876
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:47,240
the cluster or expert assigned

1877
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:51,620
but you can have one causes the data which are really small but there are

1878
01:51:52,490 --> 01:51:58,240
like continuous degrees of freedom so if you think about the video example suppose my

1879
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:01,890
body is not a discrete continuous to vector

1880
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:05,280
because the best knowledge continues

1881
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:12,470
geometrically the way you can think of this is your data lies in some subspace

1882
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:15,330
for general curve so full

1883
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:22,410
inside the meaningful coordinates there are telling you about the underlying causes and what you

1884
01:52:22,410 --> 01:52:26,450
see is that the inside an awful lot

1885
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:28,780
so you people

1886
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:32,430
these the word factor to describe these kinds continuously variable

1887
01:52:32,430 --> 01:52:37,760
and to generate the first generation within the manifold factors in

1888
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:39,850
because many generations

1889
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:42,450
so the coordinates in the internal

1890
01:52:42,450 --> 01:52:45,470
representation components of these

1891
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:48,120
so simple

1892
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:57,300
this form is called factor analysis can very all from statistics in a very simple

1893
01:52:57,390 --> 01:53:02,820
after i switched from x and z two x y

1894
01:53:03,930 --> 01:53:05,570
during his

1895
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:09,070
so the very

1896
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:12,740
and he observed variables y

1897
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:16,620
i think you can get from that and so on

1898
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:19,350
imagine this still alive

1899
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:22,490
it lies inside higher dimensional space

1900
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:24,820
so here's three and a half hours

1901
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:30,780
in terms of coordinates x y or dimensional space pictures two so the model very

1902
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:36,870
first the internal for causes x from guassian

1903
01:53:36,890 --> 01:53:42,800
and then given that in terms of you take a linear function that most of

1904
01:53:42,820 --> 01:53:48,490
lambda anyway so need to this is the mean vector and the

1905
01:53:48,510 --> 01:53:52,120
axes this subspace here are on the

1906
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:53,910
during the

1907
01:53:55,570 --> 01:53:59,180
that gives you your data vector y

1908
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:01,180
and on top of that you have some

1909
01:54:02,030 --> 01:54:03,470
so this

1910
01:54:03,490 --> 01:54:09,430
matrix is called the factor loading matrix name comes from the fact that loans

1911
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:14,760
the factors from factor is into data space

1912
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:15,950
and this no

1913
01:54:15,970 --> 01:54:19,800
here is is called sensor is usually that one

1914
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:22,590
think of it as a measurement device which measures

1915
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:25,320
y one y two y three one of those devices

1916
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:27,740
that's only and the way

1917
01:54:27,970 --> 01:54:30,550
is that

1918
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:35,700
remember that the product of two gaussians are still

1919
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:37,530
and so

1920
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:42,930
when i take this small compute the marginal distribution y

1921
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:46,090
the marginal why is just

1922
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:49,780
so this is just a fancy gap model for y

1923
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:56,120
so you might think well what would having this will invariably here x if is

1924
01:54:56,120 --> 01:55:00,760
more likely to get some of my life not i just a small development of

1925
01:55:01,830 --> 01:55:03,780
and the answer is that

1926
01:55:03,820 --> 01:55:09,050
the effective covariance marginal density y is highly constrained

1927
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:15,780
so integrate actually to pursue analytically marginalize what you see that

1928
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:17,570
it's the gaussians

1929
01:55:17,570 --> 01:55:23,730
with mean mu it's surprising and covariance which has is very for it's the our

1930
01:55:23,730 --> 01:55:25,350
product of land

1931
01:55:25,370 --> 01:55:26,720
the land is

1932
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:29,620
rectangular matrix has

1933
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:31,820
as many homes as

1934
01:55:33,930 --> 01:55:34,700
and many

1935
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:36,800
the the original surface

1936
01:55:36,850 --> 01:55:38,370
here's rank

1937
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:41,320
as some of the rate matrix was

1938
01:55:41,370 --> 01:55:46,590
so this is a very constrained form now if you think about high dimensional space

1939
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:52,260
thousands of millions of dimensions you know there's no way to estimate the variance matrix

1940
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:53,350
has been

1941
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:55,680
thousands or millions square

1942
01:55:56,950 --> 01:56:00,350
so it's very important when trying estimate gaussians

1943
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:03,390
high dimensions you have some ideas for ALL

1944
01:56:03,410 --> 01:56:08,350
so i just race this year and happened at all your brain

1945
01:56:08,450 --> 01:56:12,280
but that can any correlation between the variables

1946
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:17,160
four so this is a simple way of to model correlations between the variables using

1947
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:18,390
not very many

1948
01:56:18,490 --> 01:56:19,330
five years

1949
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:20,550
so that

1950
01:56:20,570 --> 01:56:24,890
constraint gets all its ideas were not that all

1951
01:56:24,910 --> 01:56:27,160
then this which just reduced to eighteen

1952
01:56:27,390 --> 01:56:33,620
just we want to win the ministers also we typically think of science being that
