1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,410
this is not entirely new this idea of pressure

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,270
because you may have seen people's desks

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,230
nice conversation piece

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,270
you have here

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,140
you have your magnet

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,580
and this is it

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,790
a wooden stick

8
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,960
there's a hole in here and there's a whole year

9
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,580
this is not all thousand almost all the south pole

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,980
they repel each other

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,980
that's magnetic pressure is the same thing

12
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,560
and if you drew the magnetic field configurations here

13
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,890
go like this

14
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,660
that's the magnetic field from this magnet

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,140
and this would be

16
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,770
the magnetic field that nick

17
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,520
get the same idea

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,230
you get magnetic

19
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:48,680
pressure there

20
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,950
if i rotate is magnet here

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,500
so the first of all the magnets repel which is in no way form of

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,560
levitation i'm going to show you that

23
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,020
to make this

24
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,000
bush up by

25
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,980
where you can look at it

26
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,520
but if you start rotating it for instance around with the south pole here in

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,520
the south building on the north pole there

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,830
eddy currents will instantaneously adjust to always repelled magnet

29
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,290
even if to rotate it

30
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,720
which still hang them levitate it

31
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,810
what is not so easy to understand why the whole thing is

32
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,600
so very stable as you will shortly see it's quite stable

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,910
i'm going to show you there

34
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,790
the idea first have to top it off with some

35
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:43,750
liquid nitrogen to let me do that when we still have full light

36
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,540
so at the top it off

37
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,680
this disc which is about

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,040
the image

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,160
in diameter

40
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,230
going to be superconducting

41
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,020
i can even tell you what kind of material it is

42
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,140
it is a copper oxide mixed with

43
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,750
it to him and barium and it becomes superconducting at

44
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,160
ninety degrees

45
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,450
in liquid nitrogen

46
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,580
seventy seven degrees so we're going to put a small

47
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,080
magnets on top

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,520
which we will levitate

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,950
for that

50
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,810
we're going to have the following light situation

51
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,390
course you want to see it also don't you

52
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,450
you want some light

53
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,500
there you see this

54
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,660
which is should be superconducting no

55
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,640
and here comes my little magnets are there is no magnetic flux going through there

56
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,560
itself is not a magnet

57
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,910
but now i'm going to come close was a magnet

58
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,660
any any comments go nuts in there

59
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,080
and it just floats on top

60
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,910
it's amazing isn't it

61
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,730
it is the magnetic levitation

62
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,500
you can rotate it around

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,120
eddy currents adjust instantaneously

64
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:21,220
there it is

65
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,930
you've also

66
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,520
clear enough

67
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,310
so let me get the

68
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,020
rescue my magnet

69
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,580
imagine the days of counting on this

70
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,580
book four degrees kelvin

71
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,960
superconducting now

72
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,870
you can do it this is is that

73
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,540
there are other forms of magnetic

74
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,200
going to be very promising

75
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,660
in our economy

76
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,870
we hope

77
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,310
and that is the magnetic levitation

78
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,720
can be used for trains

79
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,430
if you ever make you move fast over a

80
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,960
conducting surface

81
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,330
then you also get

82
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,460
you have to move it

83
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,560
where there you don't have to move

84
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,960
so if you look at that

85
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,460
just go view

86
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,410
don't move anymore

87
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,500
then there isn't any current going on with any current never dissipates and eat there's

88
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,870
no ice cream or because are is zero so you never lose the

89
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,640
any current

90
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,520
that's different one is coming out now i have

91
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,290
there is no or

92
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,040
and here is out

93
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,750
so we have the magnetic field

94
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,980
sort of like this

95
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,480
and i'm going to move it over the plate

96
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,930
over conducting plate and output plate here

97
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,600
comes over this conducting plates

98
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,790
the magnetic flux sort of play will change

99
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,390
if the files with fire this is actually miss the lens who says i don't

100
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,330
and so to going to run on any current in here

101
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,370
any current will undoubtedly go in this direction

102
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,790
as it comes over here

103
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,620
and this

104
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,910
current ring now

105
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,950
i will produce a magnetic field

106
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,870
in this direction

107
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,620
and look what you have you have again

108
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,960
is the north pole

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,640
of this area currently to the south pole north pole repels north pole

110
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,060
and so if this

111
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,980
as a high enough being

112
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,100
the the change of the magnetic flux

113
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,810
the fight is high enough

114
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,890
train can float

115
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,430
tens of cons

116
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,660
can be made to float

117
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,120
and the reason why in this case the train has to keep going that if

118
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,890
the train stops

119
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,140
any current will die out is no longer the fighting team that there is resistance

120
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,040
in this conductors and so you get only dissipation you get ice cream are you

121
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,540
can eat in

122
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,120
and so then the train just plunged down

123
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,910
and and that's not the case with the superconductor because you don't dissipate any

124
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,750
it's in the superconductor because superconductors no resistance

125
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,960
the idea is the same

126
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,560
but you see now why you have to

127
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,020
keep this one going

128
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,620
and why there

129
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,580
you don't

130
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,660
so again you get crease

131
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,060
magnetic field

132
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,890
like you have there

133
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:38,060
so we get magnetic pressure

134
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,600
japan and germany

135
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,430
i really the leaders in the world in the technology of maglev that's what these

136
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,350
trains are called

137
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,250
united states try to catch up

138
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,330
there's an enormous reduction in friction

139
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,810
if you can ever train

140
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,060
that is not in contact with the real in fact speeds have been

141
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,020
up to three hundred forty miles per hour

142
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,850
both germany and japan have test trains

143
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,320
we would have got it

144
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,450
in any other way except here on the right we have one flat screen

145
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,660
has this red dots which we can move

146
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,360
and if we move it

147
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,310
someone then we get ranking of the

148
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,010
the results and this what the system bus in behind

149
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,060
it collects google's search results

150
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,980
clusters them extracts in this case three major

151
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:44,860
topics like SIFT password security passwords and default whatever this means we will be able

152
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,780
to check this later on and i removed these dots stores the security view of

153
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,690
the whole

154
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,940
rankingq we will be

155
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,960
according to security passwords and see that creating secure passwords will appear at the top

156
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,920
was first friends so

157
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,670
all the hits which are all related to secure process with the here while

158
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,930
moved here this would be

159
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,650
passport safety whatever this

160
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,810
and if you go down here fault

161
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,710
this again about some

162
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:24,110
the forward pass again whatever but the idea is the following so that

163
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,620
we don't changed

164
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,730
search habits too much so

165
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,490
user gets smaller the same experience except that it can

166
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:40,410
you can move it can increase the power of the of the search of

167
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,650
one of the same search which

168
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,230
he would have got otherwise with this additional

169
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,400
because it's search point

170
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,230
so this is one way to visualize our how to help

171
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,640
visualizing such as answers

172
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:01,010
we can go there's one back inside so you can try

173
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,630
know they could always crashes when i try to second time

174
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,380
it's still in worked is

175
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,660
OK so for instance

176
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,700
a four would be

177
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,490
how obviously

178
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,300
and paper a four so let's say a few words

179
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,300
moved this point now

180
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,850
how did would get all kinds of a for all this stuff

181
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,660
if you would go here

182
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,670
this would be about the a four

183
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,750
probably former or whatever a four

184
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,570
it can mean something else

185
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,820
the car will be

186
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,820
also by the obvious this

187
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,010
i was basically the same idea

188
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,330
it's important

189
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:08,140
just say that basically server calculates this

190
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,580
this model

191
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,080
pretty much on the fly

192
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,720
and then sends all the data together with the search results on the client and

193
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,760
then basically everything what happens here happens on the client side lot

194
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,120
so this was another them up

195
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:34,940
then the next text visualisation demo which is not our stuff is text are which

196
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,220
is all the same

197
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,410
one way how to visualize the this

198
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,920
many watercourses feet go to

199
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:49,170
the web and check it

200
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:13,070
just find

201
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,330
the harm that this is

202
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:27,460
this works

203
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,160
so basically this is innovation of the

204
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,180
how i mean i'm not saying that this is the best possible way how to

205
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,110
visualize this going but business

206
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,870
it's good to see that there

207
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,530
so we can move the mouse pointer can see each of the word

208
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:52,420
each of the words and relationships this is what is called coker scorpions of these

209
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,160
words with some other works

210
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,920
and it's

211
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,120
let's say the word brought would be connected to some other which certainly

212
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,050
hunters would be sentences i think

213
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:11,230
i'm not sure how useful this is but certainly it's fun place to click

214
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:21,410
so here we can check for each of these words where they appear in

215
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,890
the least dense

216
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,420
well how they call copula so is basically it's fun and clicking it but as

217
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,380
i said so it might not be very useful

218
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,870
for instance when we click the word ghost

219
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,200
we see this ghost is connected to all this

220
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,070
other words which were highlighted for this one

221
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:53,840
OK this is an example of another type of exposition

222
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,360
and this this algorithm is

223
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,070
by the conditional probability tables that represent

224
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,100
the relationship between acts

225
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,020
and all of hair

226
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,330
is not a message this term here is

227
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:20,530
part of are directed graphical models specifying the probability distribution of the variable given its

228
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,630
so i know this is like alot of notation in that involved

229
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,080
two pick up if you haven't seen it but i just want to put all

230
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,550
review and

231
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,430
you know we can work through it

232
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,290
a little more detail one

233
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,410
in complete detail you want to actually implement all this we need to know how

234
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,930
to compute the messages that

235
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,880
it's going to stand with parents

236
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,620
and we need to compute the messages that

237
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,500
active in then

238
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,080
two its children

239
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,300
and these are the expressions for those messages

240
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,470
they're not as mysterious as they look they come from basically applying the rules of

241
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,120
and the conditional independence relationships

242
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,250
encoded by the graph

243
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,410
and we can actually look at slightly more carefully

244
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,460
and we'll see interesting things going on

245
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,740
let's look at

246
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,610
let's look at the message

247
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,830
act is going to stand with parents

248
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:48,540
this is the function of the possible values of the parent

249
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,800
and it combines

250
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,000
all this stuff that x got

251
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:59,060
from downstream OK so imagine active learning methods the use of and

252
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,460
the message explains the use of and

253
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:09,020
all this stuff x got from all of its children that lambda x

254
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,200
and then he also combined

255
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,770
are all this stuff

256
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,450
x got wrong

257
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,560
every other parent of x

258
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,120
next step

259
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,440
u i

260
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:28,300
so if you're spending a message to you i combine information from all your children

261
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,760
and all of your other parents

262
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,490
not including URI i

263
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,010
so this is the totality of all the

264
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,070
that x is gathered from all sources when it gathers all that they can send

265
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,760
a message to you i

266
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:53,280
OK the it what the message is is

267
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,470
a vector

268
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,940
of nonnegative numbers

269
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,570
they don't have the time to one

270
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,260
the message don't have to be normalized and the vector will be

271
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,550
the land of possible values the you i can

272
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:15,930
right so you i binary that just vector with two numbers that this is a

273
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,200
here in this is not equal to

274
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:25,070
we see the idea that the methods access the URI does not include any information

275
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,190
that you are

276
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,340
and similarly

277
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,850
the message that

278
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,250
it's going to spend two child y j

279
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:41,960
it includes all the information that's not from its parents

280
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,790
and all the information that x got from all the other children not including white

281
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,710
so that the way to

282
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,960
decode all this stuff

283
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,630
and if we have time i can go through

284
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,400
it's sort of a demo of the propagation with politician a

285
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,360
this hard this in my of cringe when i go through it again

286
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,790
that was belief propagation or a directed graph

287
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,760
what we do with factor graph

288
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,300
well the good news is that

289
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:29,470
factor graph propagation is just notational simpler in directed graphs we have to worry about

290
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,740
if i

291
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,350
i have this some right now and i invested for one year what do i

292
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,620
have i have

293
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,180
one plus our times one of one class of dollar

294
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,570
so that works out exactly right

295
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,300
so you have to discount

296
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,450
something that's one period in the future by dividing it by one plus are

297
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,570
the if it's

298
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,470
this is

299
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,510
present one dollar in one time period

300
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,590
which are taking to be here but it doesn't have to be here

301
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,010
the interest rate

302
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,570
has units of time so i have to

303
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,220
to specify a time period over which i measuring an interest rates

304
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,620
so typically it's a year so if it's a one year interest rates and the

305
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,200
time period is one year

306
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,950
the present value of one dollar in one time period is given by this

307
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,490
the present value

308
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,780
one dollar

309
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,010
in and periods

310
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,370
is one of the one class are

311
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,430
the and power

312
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,450
that is our

313
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:45,850
that's the all the is to list

314
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,410
i want to talk about

315
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,180
streams of

316
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,740
payment i suppose someone

317
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,950
he has a contract promises to pay

318
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,220
each period over a number of years

319
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,990
we have formulas for these

320
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,760
present values

321
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,890
and these formulas

322
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,680
are well known is going to go through them and quickly here

323
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,180
the simplest thing is something called a console

324
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:36,490
in perpetuity

325
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,030
we have a perpetuity is

326
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,140
is a

327
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,280
as or a contract pays a fixed amount of money

328
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,850
each time period

329
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,410
we call the consuls because in the early seventies hundreds

330
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,820
the british government issued

331
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,390
what they called councils are consolidated debt of the british crown

332
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,410
that paid a certain amount of pounds sterling

333
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,470
he was every six months forever

334
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,680
and you may say

335
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,740
what audacity for the british government the promise to pay anything forever will be around

336
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,260
you know as far as you're concerned is good enough has forever right

337
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,660
maybe someday

338
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,590
the british

339
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,700
uk united kingdom well

340
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,280
something will happen to it will fall apart change but that's so

341
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,330
this in the future what we

342
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,280
we can disregard that so will take that as forever

343
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,660
anyway the government might buy them back to and so

344
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,320
who cares if it is inference

345
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,300
this just talk about it forever

346
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,700
so let's say this thing pays

347
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,550
a period

348
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,890
what is the present value of that

349
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,530
well the first

350
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,010
each payment will call a coupon

351
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:59,390
OK so it pays one pound one year from now

352
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,470
but it's one year just to simplify things

353
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,200
it pays another pounds

354
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,570
two years from now

355
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,760
it pays another part three years from now

356
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,600
the present value

357
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,890
it is equal to

358
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,780
remember it starts one year from now

359
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,240
under assumption we we could do it differently but i'm assuming one year from the

360
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,160
present value is one of

361
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,850
one was are this one pound

362
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,530
over one plus are for the first year

363
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,820
for the second year it's one

364
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,260
over one class are

365
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,700
the third year is one

366
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,760
all of one class are

367
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,370
and that goes on forever

368
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,320
so that's an infinite series

369
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,930
and you know how to some that

370
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,570
i think anyway i tell you what it is

371
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,970
it's one of our

372
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,370
for the one pound or

373
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,010
if it pays c dollars for every period

374
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,370
he has value see overall

375
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,180
so that's the formula

376
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,180
for the present value

377
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,950
of a council

378
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,600
as from the most basic formalism finance

379
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,450
the interesting thing is it means that the value of the council move inversely to

380
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,850
the interest rate

381
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,930
the british government issued those consoles in the early seventeen hundreds

382
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:27,600
well they were refinanced in the late nineteenth century there still there

383
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,050
and if you want to go out and buy one

384
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,800
you can get on your laptop

385
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,030
right after this lecture and by one of them and you've got something that will

386
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,910
pay something forever

387
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:43,950
but you're going to know that the value of the market was opposite interest rates

388
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,120
of interest rates go down the value goes up

389
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,010
if interest rates go up the value of your investment goes down

390
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,660
another formula

391
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,990
it is one of the council

392
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,740
doesn't pay

393
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,760
well what i'm saying

394
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,330
the next thing

395
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,470
there is a growing problem

396
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,660
i'm tired to growing council

397
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,220
even though the british council's didn't grow

398
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,030
let's say that the british government didn't say that they pay one pound per year

399
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,620
but it will be one pound the first year

400
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,930
and then

401
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,780
growth rate g

402
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,780
and will eventually

403
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,530
be infinitely large

404
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,390
so you get

405
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,720
one pound first year

406
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,220
you get

407
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,200
one plus jeep and the second here

408
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,740
one has g squared

409
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,300
the third year

410
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,890
and so on

411
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,800
the present value of this

412
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,820
suppose it pays the same pace pounds

413
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,780
each year

414
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,100
so it would be c times this

415
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,240
alright one plus the BBC

416
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,330
pounds one close the cube thirty year et cetera

417
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,640
the the present value

418
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,320
is equal to c

419
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,850
all of these are minus g

420
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,800
that's the formula for the

421
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,680
the value of a growing council

422
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,280
g has to be less than our for this to make sense

423
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:31,720
because if g if it's growing faster than the rate of interest

424
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,450
so this infinite series will not converge

425
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:42,060
anything from some of the younger

426
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,270
and i know you're going to have

427
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,120
a set of functions h

428
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,020
OK which is one the a set of functions and you like an inner product

429
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,350
on the set of functions so that they are additive

430
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,390
so last g

431
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,890
it's going to be

432
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,620
f h

433
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,540
plus gh

434
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:12,660
the norm of any function in the space is then written as h h

435
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,830
just like linear spaces

436
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:24,700
and it's very normal the semi norm so that if this is equal to zero

437
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,680
that means h must be identically zero

438
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,980
which is it so

439
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,930
imagine everything that you know about vector spaces

440
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,870
on vector vectors

441
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,020
this is true

442
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,430
what i should say is i should give you one canonical example of infinite dimensional

443
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,450
hilbert space so that you see

444
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:51,370
the set of all this is little too which is the set of all sequences

445
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,330
in one

446
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,500
eight two

447
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,890
eighty three

448
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,290
and so on

449
00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:00,290
a set of sequences an infinitely long sequence a

450
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,710
which you can then that you have to infinitely long sequences did not infinitely long

451
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,330
so these sequences must all have the property that this

452
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,020
where there less than infinity

453
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,810
so that they are nicely defined

454
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,540
and the inner product between a sequence in

455
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,500
and the sequence b

456
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,410
is then

457
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,480
some asian AI

458
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,180
the i

459
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,370
this is almost exactly like so if you take a finite set of numbers

460
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,180
you can add them and so on you can take the norm of those numbers

461
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,660
you can take the inner product of those numbers have no in rn

462
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:48,060
just generalized to this set that infinity ward that's

463
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:57,250
so that's only want

464
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,520
there's one more property that people like

465
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,950
and that will take us to reproducing kernel hilbert spaces

466
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,950
so probably demanded very little always said he would like to classify actions

467
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,730
which will have this hilbert space structure

468
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,470
and this property is the evaluation functionals should be bounded

469
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,580
so let me first motivate that from learning from the perspective of machine learning

470
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,930
suppose you have a data set d one

471
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,910
and your learning algorithm comes up with the classifier f of the one of the

472
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,430
function f of the one

473
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,000
and you have another data set d two

474
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,290
and the classifier and you are out and comes up with the function f of

475
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,250
the two

476
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,790
so then you would like you've f the one and f of the two which

477
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:55,480
are the two functions returned by learning algorithm one on data set d one in

478
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,730
one hundred seventy two

479
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,680
now obviously f of d one and f of the two boats it in this

480
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,210
hilbert space

481
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:06,160
the hilbert space has the norm on it you can measure distances between functions in

482
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,870
the hilbert space

483
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,710
and so

484
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:14,390
you take fifty one f of the two and measure the distance

485
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,790
and then you want to say

486
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:20,080
that if f of the one minus f of the two is small

487
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:26,080
then we would like f d one and if the tool to make similar predictions

488
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,350
so if i have a data set d one and i come up with the

489
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,330
function f of the one they decided to come up with the function f of

490
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,890
the two

491
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,910
and i can measure the distance between these two functions f one and f of

492
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,660
in the hilbert space and i find these functions are very near each other

493
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,870
so very similar somehow

494
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,890
i would like it to be the case that they also makes similar predictions i

495
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,970
don't want f of the one to be making widely different predictions from f of

496
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,120
because that would somehow

497
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,140
make me lose the ability to control

498
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,430
the behaviour of this learning how

499
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,660
so what does it mean to make similar predictions at each point x it means

500
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,870
that f of the one x minus seventy two x twenty one

501
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,100
we would like this property

502
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,980
a week

503
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,850
statement is this

504
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:16,750
well that depends on whether you want to do with uniformly or not

505
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,930
so consider the evaluation function

506
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,120
OK so what's the functional

507
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,450
it will basically take it could be a linear function of

508
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:33,080
so given

509
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,100
a set of functions

510
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,330
should take you from

511
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,500
two are

512
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,490
so it's a linear function so the l applied to a function should be only

513
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,040
the number

514
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,120
and linear in that area of f one class f two

515
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,910
should be equal to and

516
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,410
of f one

517
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,370
plus and

518
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,830
1 the 4th type of

519
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:08,760
secondary bonding is hydrogen bonding hydrogen bonding and occurs

520
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:17,280
that occurs between as the name implies hydrogen and only the most electronegative elements

521
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:26,520
and that's fluorine oxygen and nitrogen only to their high average valence electron energy

522
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:32,700
this something peculiar here about the combination of high average valence electron energy and the

523
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,890
lightest element

524
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,820
and here's what I want you 1st be reminded of I'm showing here the average

525
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:45,660
valence electron energy in order and we see fluorine is that the the highest of

526
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,620
the active neon has a higher but neon doesn't participate in in chemical reactions to

527
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,610
speak up so

528
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,150
that I know there are some subtle differences in electronegativity scales 1 of them has

529
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,330
fluorine 3 . 9 8 this hazard of 4 . 1 9 it's a self

530
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,240
consistent set

531
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,020
so when we see

532
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,720
here we're up at around 20 electron volts for average valence electron energy and then

533
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,500
it tapers off something magical happens around 18

534
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,170
electron volts

535
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,370
what happens

536
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:23,370
when we put hydrogen in the presence of something that is that strongly electronegative so

537
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:28,810
let's work with the most powerful example fluorine so hydrogen donates its electron to the

538
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:35,940
covalent bond flooring donates 1 of its 7 valence electrons and here the other 6

539
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:41,240
and we know because fluorine strongly electronegative this bond is very polar and we can

540
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,780
designate the flooring and delta negative and the hydrogen and has delta plus

541
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:51,960
and let's look at this and in greater detail when we start pulling hard on

542
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,030
the electron associated with hydrogen what's left is that

543
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,960
by a lot an Adam that has

544
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,290
it's protons in the nucleus in an hour and n minus 1 electrons in the

545
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:08,330
case of hydrogen we had 1 electron when you pull that electron hard which leaving

546
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,550
is something that's essentially approach

547
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:16,940
this is a hydrogen is is is the unit of its electron it is a

548
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,850
proton proton is very special the proton has a charge of plus 1 but it's

549
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,760
got a volume that's tiny tiny tiny

550
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,700
so the charge density is very very hot

551
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,130
so now let's bring up another feature

552
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:42,650
so here's a 2nd HF we know that dipole-dipole interactions happen and that was the

553
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:48,340
category number 1 so let's start with a simple dipole-dipole interaction the negative end of

554
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,090
over the last

555
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,810
HF molecule

556
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,500
sidles up to the positive and of the right HF molecule

557
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,550
then the magic happens you see this non bonding domains sitting here on the right

558
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:05,180
side those non bonding electrons and then we will a way out there and here's

559
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:10,760
this hydrogen over here and it's electron is being pulled so hard by the fluorine

560
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,310
on the right I mean this hydrogen hardly gets visitation rights to see this electron

561
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,460
OK so there's these 2 electrons sitting over here

562
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,090
and I was looking over there and I never again you have again any time

563
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:30,220
with with my electron but disease 2 lone pairs of electrons sitting there and so

564
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,290
can you imagine that there is a force that's set up between this lone pair

565
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:40,720
of electrons because this rate because it's got so many electrons it tends to neglect

566
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,760
its electrons it doesn't pay close attention you know if you can if you come

567
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,000
from a big family you don't get as much attention as if you're an only

568
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,610
child right so fluorine and it's got electrons already so if 2 come straight off

569
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,870
following doesn't care so that's what's happening here is hydrogen that doesn't have the full

570
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:06,520
impact of its single electron here's 2 electrons then way way out

571
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:11,010
this is a recipe for attraction and that's exactly what happens and so we forces

572
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,190
established between this non bonding pair

573
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:37,260
when grouped together they can make notes and was in

574
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,170
music record there might be several nodes so that's what this model represents and we

575
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:50,860
have this by attention to model of time varying amplitude and we have these omega

576
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,620
OK and which are the frequencies of the partials for each of the nodes and

577
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,080
we want to

578
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:00,680
this moment of peace and music can be able to extract the component

579
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,950
right so

580
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,910
we have seen last time

581
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:09,680
that we can very easy rider likelihood when it is written in the form

582
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,830
we have the many in the parameters some of which are

583
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:20,260
continuous parameters such as the amplitude and some of which are this critical component

584
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:24,020
the parameters such as the number of nodes the number of of

585
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,990
and so on

586
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:30,050
right we had applied bayesian

587
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,770
analysis and that by defining priors

588
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,410
so prefers amplitudes

589
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,190
priors for the frequencies

590
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,790
which may look like that

591
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:45,150
prof and the number of partials for each node x attracts

592
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,830
so i tried to explain you how to select with partial so as to

593
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,800
to respect some compromise solution between the

594
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:58,550
the physical phenomenon and the easiness of implementation

595
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,780
right so we had ended up with that

596
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,620
posterior distribution of the

597
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,840
of the process

598
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,150
which could be

599
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,290
written as

600
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,840
this shorter from where where we have marginalized out some of the parameters and we

601
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:20,720
could also have the conditional posterior distribution for some of the parameters

602
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,240
so this is a very nice thing because we can have

603
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,660
it's simply the inference from the frequency parameters and when we have then we can

604
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,660
have the other parameters so that's why we chose this priors which are conjugate priors

605
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,160
which enable analytical integration

606
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,790
right so we're in the middle of this is it now

607
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,350
as an example of how to use MCMC

608
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:48,250
i was describing the algorithm that could be applied to this problem

609
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:56,760
this is just some that's the that humans were ready

610
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,030
so right

611
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,420
this is the basic centers and so we have seen

612
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,530
four is the

613
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:17,470
and to pointer or something

614
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:25,100
OK we have in one's initilisation which consists of finding the first set of parameters

615
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,980
for the problem and then iterations

616
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,060
of the metropolis hastings algorithm when we

617
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,380
first generate a candidate according to some rule

618
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,570
thank you

619
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:41,140
so we first generated good candidate according to a proposal distribution which is

620
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,170
so it is a sample into our stochastic way and then this sample is tested

621
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,390
by computing this ratio

622
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:53,710
right and the cause to increase shareholder lectures you have seen that this ratio

623
00:37:53,730 --> 00:38:00,430
and this algorithm needs to fulfill if you conditions so have to provide us with

624
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,740
a convenient markov chain in which

625
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,580
in distribution to the actual distribution

626
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:12,970
and with the metropolis hastings rule should be you can have your algorithm like that

627
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:17,160
then you will have to be convenient for markov chains

628
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,910
OK so

629
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,810
starting to explain

630
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,490
in our example so we had the initialisation part

631
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,180
which is fairly standard

632
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,110
right OK

633
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,280
now i was explaining how we can

634
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,250
a date

635
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,610
the nodes so

636
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,630
we have a piece of music we have a certain set of parameters that represent

637
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,260
the music at the sentence that

638
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,240
and we want to to from this we want to generate a candidate

639
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,480
which would be a bit different from the previous sample and which ones should represent

640
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,880
better music

641
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,560
OK so that's where i explained that

642
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,120
in this example for we have been

643
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,880
we have had to design special

644
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,460
reversible jumps

645
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,890
because the MCMC algorithm but what i wanted to emphasise is that in many practical

646
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,330
the move that you need to use it doesn't exist yet so you have to

647
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,000
design it yourself

648
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,360
and this was just an example how you can do it

649
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,680
right so

650
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:28,640
if this represents the frequency of the note for distributed ESB of a of a

651
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,400
musical signal is just one of the fundamental here and the different bottles and

652
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:41,070
possible way to generate a candidate which should represent the better it is for example

653
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,000
to had

654
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,040
a few powerful

655
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,530
another possibility is to remove the bottles

656
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:54,300
another one is to suppress one every to partial so as to avoid oktave

657
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,520
and to add in between voxels

658
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,060
the first thing that

659
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:07,340
in the lecture of his job he explained you that the chain has to have

660
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:11,200
some conditions due to converge and here you can notice that

661
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,550
for each move we have the reverse moves

662
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:17,680
if i had partial also have to remove portions move

663
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,790
and this is a very important condition if you want to encourage them to be

664
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,720
correct you have to design both smooth

665
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,510
OK and further divide

666
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,960
and multiply

667
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,630
it's exactly the same

668
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,140
you have a corresponding to move

669
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,570
just remarking

670
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,580
and to be able to suppress every other two bottles

671
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:41,890
you need to have an even number of partial

672
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,090
and in many cases

673
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,010
you don't necessarily have an even number of rules so there is that there is

674
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,760
some need to make

675
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,260
the special thing to make it reversible that is you might be able to put

676
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,870
go from any situation

677
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,960
to be able to perform this move

678
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,670
so that's why i try to explain it in a little more

679
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,670
with bit more details

680
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,780
OK so this is the divine moves as the divine movies

681
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:14,650
this one

682
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,860
we're dividing the fundamental frequency

683
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,150
by a factor of two

684
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,650
so that's why it's called divide and we are adding

685
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:27,740
partial in between so we're not only changing the parameter that we are also changing

686
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:31,970
the model because we are adding new particles

687
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:36,000
so the mother becomes bigger

688
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,440
this is the new number of four

689
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,710
OK this is the old one and this is

690
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,920
the candidate and as you can see

691
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:48,490
we do not only multiplied by two which would end up with an even number

692
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,540
is that one

693
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,500
start if i know

694
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:58,550
now it's marginalized

695
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,120
this to me

696
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,540
usually a function

697
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,960
the particular point where to me

698
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:08,930
again this

699
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,490
it's just because have to go also

700
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,830
as well

701
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,520
the predictive probability

702
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,540
not just by taking the

703
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,690
distribution of the latent function

704
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,700
just saying well what prediction was that give rise to

705
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:32,210
this is just like that i would like to

706
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:38,780
and again we have in world

707
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,340
it this very happy situation because just two things

708
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,950
and i

709
00:42:44,950 --> 00:43:10,350
i don't really think compare for the

710
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,770
the same on ground order to just

711
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,460
these assumptions about

712
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,440
what's happening

713
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,990
because the

714
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
what year

715
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,440
more describing the

716
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,380
when the patients in the region

717
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,250
if we

718
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,390
among them

719
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,750
voices of signal

720
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:32,870
that's fine

721
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,660
but as far as it

722
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,670
just think what the structure of the

723
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,110
we may not be

724
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,440
in the end

725
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,410
you know

726
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,780
thank you

727
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,850
you can also be

728
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:02,840
and to become a lot less

729
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:11,660
OK so the now just go quickly through the two

730
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,800
two things you can so be

731
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,550
now in the previous slide

732
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,460
observations by

733
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,570
ask me

734
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,020
the nomination

735
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,270
o point

736
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,810
with was somewhere here we'll all be

737
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:35,930
nomination by this person

738
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,490
of the original

739
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:43,240
which looks like this

740
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,570
i don't understand especially

741
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,610
so the question here is the

742
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,050
the area between x

743
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,270
star excites

744
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:55,030
this is the prior variance

745
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,890
not at all what's going to happen

746
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,300
for the first

747
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,830
that is just thing

748
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,540
in in great

749
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:11,030
not very easy

750
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,830
this is higher

751
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,190
and then very slowly

752
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,440
predictions here

753
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:22,960
posted here

754
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:29,160
this to tell you how much the training points

755
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,780
told you you

756
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,670
this is i

757
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:39,140
that's why it works

758
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,760
i should draw

759
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,390
on the prior

760
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,740
o point five functions

761
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,340
you can draw or

762
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,810
and a number of stations

763
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:00,590
national here

764
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,090
distribution b

765
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,250
and also wrong

766
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:16,070
we see that night when far away from the ones that to

767
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,800
so the thing which is important is the

768
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,760
much like u

769
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,530
you can use the most likely to choose

770
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,340
my life

771
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:36,330
what we actually want to do it also

772
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,520
the model

773
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,560
it is

774
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:43,860
to do this

775
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:48,340
and this is the

776
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,300
by uniform

777
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:53,880
well you know

778
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:57,580
these beautiful

779
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,860
the standard model

780
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,260
for practical purposes is not

781
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:12,460
and model selection and this

782
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,480
again we use that term was a normalizing constant

783
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,210
the school i

784
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:30,110
the science case gases four

785
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,590
and they get looks like this

786
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:36,220
and now back to the original question

787
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,980
but the terms

788
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,970
the expression for the last

789
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,140
except for one term is that

790
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,280
how well the vision

791
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,990
if it discusses

792
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,080
has programs in the the range

793
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,330
the second here

794
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,700
doesn't depend

795
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:03,130
on the observation that was going to

796
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,770
croquet in my garden we weren't satisfied with the segmentation so we went in and

797
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:09,230
made some additional constraints

798
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:15,090
and the constraints consist of marking pix els as being background pixels

799
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:21,480
and hitting those pixels to the you know associating them irrevocably with the sick

800
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,440
the x equals zero state

801
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,010
and actually will be kind of nice if

802
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:29,900
when you make this modification which is quite localised you have to kind of go

803
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,480
right back to the beginning and solve the optimisation problem all over again and you

804
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,800
could do that and it works really well and you know the optimum that you

805
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,530
get is guaranteed to be a global optimum

806
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:47,530
so it doesn't make any difference whether you sort of solve the problem incrementally or

807
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:52,210
ab initio is not the solution but because it will make a solution difference to

808
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:56,130
the efficiency of the of the city so

809
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,480
it turns out there is a rather neat way

810
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,710
are doing graphcut dynamically where you know it when you add constraints

811
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:09,340
you only have to do a little bit of extra work to implement those constraints

812
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:13,920
the idea is

813
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,590
having solved the first problem

814
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:21,940
and you know read off the maximum flow rate of the configuration and so on

815
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,690
we actually were smart enough school

816
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,170
the maximum flow that we obtain that for the flow i just keep the graph

817
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,000
is still there keep the flow

818
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:33,070
on the graph what about restarting

819
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,960
optimisation problem with the new

820
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,730
with the new

821
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,710
modify problem but starting with the old flow

822
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,090
it might be a good thing to do anything

823
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:47,800
because they all flow into a lot of work to establish that flow and you

824
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,980
know this editing

825
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:55,000
this editing operations any changed in small part of the graph most of it is

826
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,280
in fact so surely the old flow

827
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,400
it's going to be good

828
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,210
so what do you think should we start with the old flow proceed from there

829
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:04,710
good idea or not

830
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,960
my friend this why not

831
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:13,730
you know i was looking at the guy who didn't give a good idea to

832
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:14,570
do that

833
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,380
you want to tell us why not

834
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:33,110
right i think i understand you saying which is that you know in changing the

835
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:37,980
graph i was free to change the capacities of links the way how i want

836
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,860
and maybe i reduce the capacity of some links

837
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,250
maybe i reduce the capacity of one of the

838
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,730
the level of flow that was previously playing

839
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,170
previously that flow within the last thing but now it is

840
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:58,900
and i'm thinking at the moment just about these these unitary links the

841
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,030
the values will get onto the binary things because actually for this problem every labelling

842
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:08,360
rheory labeling in the reapplying constraints in the segmentation problem

843
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,780
the it's enough to modify your railings all i need to do is you put

844
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,500
an infinite cost let's say

845
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,300
on one of these

846
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:24,500
links and actually we might be worried about putting infinite cost something

847
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:25,840
you might worry

848
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:31,710
my one like you are

849
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:38,440
no termination because you know we could be said to me you know so far

850
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,420
prove termination such as it was relied on the fact that all links and cost

851
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:46,050
maybe there's another prexamination the required

852
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:50,960
could be more liberal so far slightly worrying but it turns out actually infinity can

853
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:56,150
be set to a finite value in other words you can find a bound

854
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:59,550
for a given problem such that if you set the cost of that value it

855
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:03,510
has exactly the same effect setting it infinity

856
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:07,920
that's kind of interesting so we never actually have to do that so anyway supposing

857
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,440
on a particular

858
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:14,940
it turns out that yes the flow has exceeded the capacity on that link

859
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,770
on the edge by saying amount delta

860
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,480
so what can i do about that well we go back to our old friend

861
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,110
the re parameterisation

862
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,670
and simply add delta on both of these

863
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,900
cost the that's the

864
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:36,770
cost linking the k note to the source and the one link indicates the sink

865
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,030
and so now the problem is isn't change because have the consider the energy as

866
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:45,130
and might a wasteful because we've had to add

867
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:48,630
capacity onto this link as well as of this link so you know we've created

868
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:52,280
some residual capacity that will have to be dealt with in eventually but at least

869
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,420
it so it's the problem is about the problem is right it still correct problem

870
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,710
we want to solve and we've got now valid flow in the sense that the

871
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:04,300
flow doesn't exceed capacity anyway so now you can start that from that flow and

872
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:09,840
start searching again a residual residual flows and so on and they are written before

873
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:19,440
we can see what

874
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:34,090
you can't OK question is can i just sort of take the offending flow but

875
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:35,070
it is zero

876
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,460
you can't just take one piece of flow

877
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,300
well defined one edge

878
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,440
but it is zero at least you should worry about that because now

879
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,150
you've changed the balance

880
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:48,940
a flows have particular note now it's sort of physically impossible flow if you like

881
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:52,820
in the sense that you've got the sum of the flow at any node is

882
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,250
not be zero as

883
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,540
what was selected four

884
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,080
if it was not

885
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:01,640
a complicated noble algorithm for doing things

886
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:03,710
arithmetical problems

887
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:05,740
which i can't believe

888
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:07,640
what it was i think

889
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,330
this consciousness

890
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:10,620
you see

891
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:11,940
i would argue

892
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:15,460
the consciousness which has many manifestations

893
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:17,660
passive things quality

894
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,700
perception and the color red appreciation for

895
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:21,780
melody are

896
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,940
so four four active free will all these things

897
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:32,180
also was here which have to do with consciousness and when we know the pain love prior determination

898
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:38,930
intelligence discussed such such a our country on one word at understanding

899
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,180
and also only understanding in a very specific context

900
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,750
namely the one which used to

901
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,110
arrive with thee

902
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:50,380
validity geneva

903
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,820
and the fact that can be derived from a

904
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:56,190
in fact i'm gonna give you this argument later on so

905
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:57,390
way forward

906
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,080
that's the hardest part of what i mean say blog alchemy the argument

907
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:04,470
so it's not something which is not difficult

908
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,220
and that gives an outline

909
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,070
and it the basic point is understanding what you're doing

910
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:18,620
and you can't it seems to me formalize understanding in terms of a purely computational system

911
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:23,580
and here is the issue i see is a computer computer controlled control robot capable

912
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:26,360
genuine understanding with this other questions come up here

913
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:30,600
and whether you could test for understanding is one question

914
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:32,640
and that's

915
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:39,390
relates during tests they can you see well can you ask your computer or person which averages

916
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,900
a question which requires understanding in the response

917
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:46,550
hand that's the sort of thing that computer center lack

918
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,090
in fact you see i would say that

919
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:53,170
how we use computers and most things if you wanted to solve some

920
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:54,930
simulate some

921
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,460
problem about how stars behavior something and you have

922
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:03,700
calculation you want to perform the see what is going to do

923
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,640
well your supply understanding

924
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:13,120
the computer that's the calculation is a symbiotic relation we have computers that's fine i have no problem with that

925
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:17,140
but it doesn't seem to be okay the answer that the computer produces it has

926
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,230
the remotest idea what it is what is four

927
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:24,950
you have to supply the understanding the system really understanding is what the computer doesn't

928
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,950
and now we have three words here

929
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,780
how can i not going define understanding

930
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,940
i don't know how define understanding

931
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:38,700
three other was i don't have define other intelligence is one and awareness is another

932
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:41,800
what i'm saying is that they seem to depend

933
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,840
based intelligence whatever it is

934
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,650
well i would think depends on understanding because i would like to say on entity

935
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:50,380
it is intelligent

936
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,270
it doesn't possess understand

937
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:55,700
that's certainly seems to be a natural use the words

938
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:00,080
i would hesitate to say that an entity

939
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:01,840
possesses understanding

940
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,370
if it doesn't possess awareness

941
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,600
so it is related to this consciousness is when this is an aspect of consciousness

942
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,100
it seems to be so as i said this doesn't say that computers can have it

943
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,310
it's just saying that the interrelated in this kind of way

944
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:20,080
so if i understand it can be shown to be on computation and that's a

945
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:22,720
the argument just been trying to present you with

946
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:26,430
and intelligence is not a matter of computation moreover system

947
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,720
if aspects of awareness and perhaps all of

948
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,490
beyond computational so so that's the my position here

949
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,400
is that

950
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,380
these things are

951
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:36,930
beyond computation

952
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,570
now i wanna get slightly more technical and i hope you'll bear with me here

953
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,890
because i want to give a proof

954
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,840
of the statement i

955
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:47,970
giving you before

956
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,110
one this here

957
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:52,170
and today just wonder introduce

958
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:53,070
a few

959
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:56,380
first civil just

960
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:01,880
there's a thing called a pi one sentence that's actually one of the simplest types

961
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,370
of mathematical statement you can make

962
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,930
which can be extremely difficult to prove

963
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:09,620
and one of the most famous

964
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:10,520
is he

965
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:14,320
famous famous last theorem was proved by andrew wiles

966
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:15,550
a few years ago

967
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:22,700
the famous gold box conjecture as a out fellows last summer what you've probably heard

968
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,850
the go by conjectures that every

969
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,740
even number greater than two

970
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,570
is the sum of two prime numbers is still unproved

971
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,980
and there's the lagrange theorem that every

972
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:40,190
natural number is the sum of four squares natural numbers well large prove that's it is a theorem

973
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:45,770
but these are all examples of what are called taiwan sentences and they can all be phrased

974
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,040
in the following form you can say

975
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:50,140
there is a computation

976
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,790
that's this a turing machine action

977
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:56,020
if it

978
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,370
goes on forever

979
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,530
that's saying this by one sentence is true

980
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,910
if it stops at some stage

981
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:04,560
that's the say is false

982
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:05,820
so you set it

983
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:06,870
looking four

984
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:10,550
let's say they go by one you said set looking far

985
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:15,240
even numbers which are not the sum of two primes but not too sure about four

986
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:20,530
so far this use of the word blog site which is the unofficial apple weblog

987
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:24,200
is a community block saying

988
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:29,570
so first of all the study of the differences between active and influential bloggers

989
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,930
so in the chart on the left side you see

990
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,340
most active bloggers which are listed on this blog site

991
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:39,220
and on the right side you see

992
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,530
most influential bloggers which is generated by more

993
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:49,180
the names in italics are the ones which are common to both lists

994
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:54,450
so based on these lists you can identify that there are some differences between active

995
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:56,080
intervention dollars

996
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:02,390
and then you can also identify four different categories of bloggers like the ones active

997
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:07,890
there are some inactive but influential bloggers and active but they are not as influential

998
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:11,320
and it is fourth that each which is an active and non engine

999
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:15,640
but you don't have them because the summary ourselves this in some blog posts and

1000
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:20,490
moreover these are very influential

1001
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:26,820
so next we study of without any parameters on of these are the formats which

1002
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:27,740
we considered

1003
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,640
is relevant or not

1004
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,070
the formalism study

1005
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,070
we generate

1006
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:42,390
different lists for these influential bloggers by taking out one

1007
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:43,700
but i mean each day

1008
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:47,300
so we see c five contributions on the x axis

1009
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:51,570
the first one is not things which is basically considering only the three parameters not

1010
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:56,760
the openings and then no comments which is of the three founders except the commons

1011
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:00,430
in the blog post length and then doing things and then the fifth one is

1012
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:03,220
all in basically you have although

1013
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,930
parameters in the model

1014
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:08,080
they can see you have are

1015
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,740
different countries have different arrangements for

1016
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,490
these bloggers

1017
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:17,030
so none of these two configurations have similar rankings so

1018
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,260
this means that

1019
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,660
including different parameters

1020
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:26,280
these changes in these are the traditional owners

1021
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:31,140
we also some of the correlation studies between these different parameters so what we did

1022
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:32,240
was we

1023
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,640
did a lot of

1024
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:39,390
you know pairwise coalition for these different parameters so far these four parameters with the

1025
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:44,350
solution to be found or one of these beers are actually correct

1026
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:48,740
you have to use all these with parameters

1027
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,240
and then

1028
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:53,320
he also

1029
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:56,430
initially there are some of the parameters

1030
01:01:56,450 --> 01:02:01,140
which can be used to find influential bloggers so we used the rate of convergence

1031
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,850
is one of the possible it

1032
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:07,530
so the number assumption would be like if you get a spiky comments reaction then

1033
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:12,050
that post is really influential as compared to flat comments reaction but what we found

1034
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:13,950
was different because

1035
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:16,970
these two are available french force and

1036
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:18,240
the they

1037
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,850
exactly what kind of reaction so discussing the fact that despite the fact that we

1038
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:24,620
are dealing with this

1039
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,890
inflation of course not

1040
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:34,370
so far you try to understand the influential bloggers hold they are different from active

1041
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:36,800
bloggers different types of influential bloggers

1042
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:39,140
and there temporal patterns

1043
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,200
and more and more parameters

1044
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:46,370
this one is basically gives you the

1045
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:50,410
temporal patterns of influential bloggers and the

1046
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,930
the heat map is arranged in such a way that all the

1047
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,240
give you a different

1048
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,260
or this blog site

1049
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:03,120
and the columns gives you the bloggers which have been influential

1050
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,320
at some point of time

1051
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:08,120
the kind of media gives you the of

1052
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,370
level of

1053
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:13,300
influence they had so the darker the colour is the more influential

1054
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,700
they were at that time

1055
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:19,280
so so far we have not right

1056
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,710
at the first one is the substitutional impurity and then if you flip over on

1057
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:28,980
the back side and I have a copy of this cartoons and so here's a

1058
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:34,470
substitutional impurity atoms its we've seen this already when we put phosphorus and the silicon

1059
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:40,470
1 example it occupies a normal lattice site occupies a normal lattice site so there

1060
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:44,470
is the door open that we've seen before and also you towards the end of

1061
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:51,190
the lecture hall boron and dined substitution actually sits at the normal our carbon lattice

1062
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:57,230
site there also alloying elements such as magnesium and aluminum there very few medals they're

1063
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:04,380
used in commerce in pure for most metals are used in the form of allies

1064
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:09,680
that is to say solid solutions so for example this aluminum cans is dominantly aluminum

1065
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:13,730
contains a certain amount of magnesium and a certain amount of silicon and this is

1066
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:17,860
designed given the properties that it needs 1 of the main properties that we need

1067
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:23,520
and this can start is the ability to have a very very rapid delight of

1068
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,880
the atoms this if you look carefully there's no seem on the bottom of the

1069
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:31,090
this is made of a single sheet of

1070
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:39,500
and so the sheet moves over a Die Presse punches down up down and forms

1071
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:46,110
the u-shaped right circular cylinder and then a 2nd pieces crimped onto the top you

1072
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:49,570
can imagine the high speed at which the atoms of gliding over 1 another and

1073
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:53,990
part of what gives us the ability to the is the allies magnesium is isn't

1074
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:59,660
is purposely added to aluminum we've seen color goals and this is 1 example is

1075
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:06,210
nickel going into gold which will turn from its very buttery almost buttery ductility into

1076
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:09,610
something that's got a little bit of strength to mean wondering that if you put

1077
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:13,230
it down on the on the dresser at 1st to form so we have to

1078
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:16,240
give some strength and in this case we can alter its colors so this is

1079
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:24,860
a nickel Adam sitting on the SEC site normally occupied by gold again substitutional impurity

1080
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:29,660
here's the last 1 we learn about 7 up in the lithium citrate 7 suppose

1081
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:35,740
your on colander administering sailing in the in the hospital and as follows me 5

1082
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:42,330
% sodium chloride in water but if there a lithium impurities substituting for sodium in

1083
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,470
the sodium chloride lattice

1084
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:50,900
is gonna dissolve and if you got some sodium deficient patient medium some lithium chloride

1085
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:54,950
it's gonna be a bad day at the office so you know substitutional impurities can

1086
01:05:54,950 --> 01:06:01,020
have deleterious effects so those were examples of substitutional impurities the 2nd type is the

1087
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:06,900
ins interstitial impurities in it occupies the position between lattice sites and you go to

1088
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:13,740
the cartoons you'll see this highlighted and the interstitial impurity obviously this Adams small it

1089
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:18,780
has to fit into the void space between the atoms so we did the calculations

1090
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:22,380
we know that close-packed FCC lattice is

1091
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,900
74 %

1092
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:31,570
and 26 per cent of all i'd like 26 % voice is not just randomly

1093
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:36,540
distributed it is there nothing in between the atoms so I could take all the

1094
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:43,710
atoms away and I could give you a lattice comprising the interstitial sites you understand

1095
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:49,710
the concept of lattices simply points in space so instead of putting gold atoms there

1096
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:54,660
let's put the space between the golden imagine what we can do so here's an

1097
01:06:54,660 --> 01:07:00,000
example of an interstitial atoms small and it's obviously impurity because it's different from the

1098
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,540
composition of the parent of material and so there are desirable and undesirable so an

1099
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:13,040
example of a desirable and element is carbon in iron carbonyl iron is the basis

1100
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,860
for steel without

1101
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:18,850
carbon iron we wouldn't have steel and

1102
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:24,590
the interesting thing about carbon irony is that the

1103
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:31,450
radius the radius of the carbon atoms is actually greater than the radius of the

1104
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:34,640
interstitial site in iron

1105
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:40,760
greater than the radius of the interstitial site in prior so therefore when the carbon

1106
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:48,020
goes into that interstitial site it actually distorts the lattice suppresses back on the parents

1107
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:54,350
iron ladders and through this distortion of strengthens the material

1108
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:59,760
another example is hydrogen and lantern nickel five it goes into the interstices in this

1109
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,070
compound lantern nickel five

1110
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:09,680
voids that are large enough to accommodate hydrogen and hydrogen can go in this axis

1111
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:13,380
sponging hydrogen at peak loading

1112
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,740
can go at this level

1113
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:19,750
we have a huge amount of hydrogen going in here the density of hydrogen 11

1114
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:25,510
medical firemen saturation is greater than liquid hydrogen itself and this materials under investigation along

1115
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:28,590
it is great

1116
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:32,340
i use partial derivatives because i'm not changing x

1117
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:36,160
that's the justification for the articles

1118
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:40,300
now again he this the first thing that

1119
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:42,070
i'm going to write for this

1120
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:45,010
and the fact

1121
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:46,490
now you get

1122
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:48,160
delta x

1123
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:54,180
no i

1124
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:59,030
doing something that mathematicians would never do i'm going to find out

1125
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:06,660
don't tell u eighteen or whatever people that i did that

1126
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,300
so now what you have

1127
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,360
is that unified by t

1128
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,970
thanks to the tall white square

1129
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:18,220
on some value of x

1130
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,150
it is now

1131
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:25,920
x squared

1132
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:27,840
and believe it or not

1133
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:32,630
this is a big moment in our life

1134
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:35,340
you view differential equation

1135
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,050
of y which is a function of x and t

1136
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:43,240
i will buy you take the derivative time and you take the robot double derivative

1137
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:56,090
what is a possible solution to this differential equation

1138
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,650
you can just see it

1139
01:09:57,650 --> 01:10:02,360
by looking at it you immediately see what the solution must be

1140
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,820
any function

1141
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:08,470
value function

1142
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:13,110
you can come up with anyone i don't care which one any single valued function

1143
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:15,300
or fax

1144
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,530
one minus

1145
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,820
once the times t

1146
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,160
well satisfied difference just look at it

1147
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:25,860
you can see it works

1148
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:30,070
i think the second derivative in time

1149
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:34,260
he gets his career out you get the second derivative of the function

1150
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:37,920
take the seventh second derivative next you only get the

1151
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:40,570
second derivative of the function and that's all

1152
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,880
so all it requires is

1153
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:44,430
that c

1154
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:45,970
is the square root

1155
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,220
but you know

1156
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:58,700
that year month salary that any single valued function will satisfy this difference

1157
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:03,820
one of them in you that c

1158
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,130
one dimensional that c

1159
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:10,090
beats per second is the velocity

1160
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:13,340
if i have apples here

1161
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,550
i was also there

1162
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:19,400
this can only be in policy

1163
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:22,740
as the dimension of the velocity

1164
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,550
so therefore

1165
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,470
you might as well write this

1166
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:29,610
as part minus fifty

1167
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:35,760
UML model right before here

1168
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:37,340
the velocity

1169
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:39,720
and we might as well change now

1170
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:42,590
this differential equation in a way more

1171
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:44,590
more uniform way

1172
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:46,650
which is what i'm going to do do now

1173
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,880
which is one of these script

1174
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,200
ninety two y

1175
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:55,430
calls to y

1176
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:57,900
x squared

1177
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,930
this equation

1178
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:02,030
generally called

1179
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:03,990
the wave equation

1180
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:07,450
it will be with us until the end of the course

1181
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:08,610
to death

1182
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:14,630
do us part

1183
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,220
it is really a big moment

1184
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,180
because you're going to see this equation

1185
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,450
many times

1186
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,220
for many different systems

1187
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,260
but now you have seen it

1188
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,320
being derived for this

1189
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,860
very specific case

1190
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,740
let's now evaluate

1191
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:35,260
the meaning of the v

1192
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:42,240
if i have a

1193
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:50,650
and i think just a function

1194
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:54,950
could be assigned to the cosine i think one way more imaginative i think this

1195
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,880
that's my function

1196
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,840
it is to be single valued can

1197
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,340
must be singled out

1198
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:09,320
that's my function

1199
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,030
so that's my function as

1200
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:15,510
time t

1201
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:17,420
let's take for free

1202
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:20,240
always the positive number for simplicity

1203
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:21,820
i'm going to call it even

1204
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,840
he is always positive right

1205
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,090
and i want to know

1206
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:34,610
final comment later in time when there a minus sign here what that function looks

1207
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:40,340
so it equal zero i gave it to you

1208
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:41,630
what would it look like

1209
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,530
a little bit later in time

1210
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:47,680
if there's a minus sign

1211
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:51,300
any suggestions

1212
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,570
making it smaller

1213
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:55,830
i'm beginning to see the dark

1214
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:59,080
the lines are the diffraction which is taking over

1215
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,850
look at this and the maximum

1216
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,080
right there

1217
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:03,520
it's getting lighter

1218
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:04,770
getting wider

1219
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:07,770
and i make this slip narrower getting wider

1220
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:12,420
it's getting wider the club beautiful you see these destructive interferences

1221
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,120
we're like was like his darkness

1222
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:20,920
while right now it is at least ten times wider than it was before

1223
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,990
now it twenty times wider

1224
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,420
and get very faint of course it gets very faint because if i make this

1225
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:30,070
very narrow not much like go through is nothing i can do about it

1226
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:34,120
incredibly impressive this is how white

1227
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:36,700
that sounds maximum becomes

1228
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,090
that is very characteristic for the fraction

1229
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,860
this leads the wider

1230
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:48,700
diffraction pattern at the center maximum

1231
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:53,410
now it is in monochromatic lights monochromatic light means that you

1232
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:56,140
have practically only one wavelength

1233
01:14:58,110 --> 01:14:59,160
that's the way

1234
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,800
that i can make you see this

1235
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,940
from your own seats

1236
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:05,850
that is what we're going to do

1237
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,820
with the

1238
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,590
with the cars that you have

1239
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:13,930
so if you can get the cards out now

1240
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:14,990
we did this

1241
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:20,320
in one color right green lights almost one called almost monochromatic so you see a

1242
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:24,190
beautiful pattern you're very well defined guidelines

1243
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:27,310
you now can use this little slide that you have

1244
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:29,120
born in front of your i

1245
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,440
and i'm going to make you see this white flight

1246
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,650
using all the features that you're supposed to see

1247
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:38,100
but it's even more interesting in white light

1248
01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:42,410
with white light you have little red you have little blue you have a little

1249
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,960
and so these minimum

1250
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:45,960
will fall

1251
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:47,960
at different locations of course

1252
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:52,140
so you don't see it as beautiful as i showed you as this thing as

1253
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:57,100
i showed you in green but you seem very distinctly the center maximum you see

1254
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:58,370
dark lines

1255
01:15:58,370 --> 01:16:00,150
on either side

1256
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:02,940
the main reason why i want you to see this is

1257
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,640
if you manage to manipulate

1258
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:07,830
the size of the slits

1259
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:09,480
the size of a

1260
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:13,890
if you manage to manipulate that when you make it narrower

1261
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:16,920
notice that the diffraction pattern gets brawler

1262
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,770
and not the other way around

1263
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:22,750
so first make sure that you get it you begin to see the dark areas

1264
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:26,480
and and then try to make it a little narrower

1265
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,390
and then you see it opens up

1266
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,040
this is precisely what i did

1267
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:33,190
with the variable split here

1268
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:37,140
so given the benefit of find help me that actually you don't have to pull

1269
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,670
it open project you can

1270
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:41,870
move one piece of the car behind the other cards

1271
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,250
so you want to go to the back in europe

1272
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:49,060
your found comes forward that works very well for me

1273
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,420
o can see clearly the diffraction pattern

1274
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:56,150
very good thank the card with you impress your parents

1275
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:59,710
and look at home that very bright street lights

1276
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,600
you will still see the same

1277
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,190
diffraction pattern although not as ideal

1278
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:07,730
as you see it here because our sources online source and that helps of course

1279
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:16,500
if you split is vertical

1280
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:22,060
if i don't have a

1281
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:27,040
so that's as an opening but if i have a circular opening then

1282
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,960
the pattern that you would expect

1283
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,670
is the same that you see here which you have to

1284
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,920
rotated about this line because you know actual symmetry

1285
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:38,870
so you don't have a long slit but you have a circular opening

1286
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,420
and indeed that is approximately correct

1287
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:45,000
if you had a circular opening

1288
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,140
you would see is centre maximum which would be very bright

1289
01:17:48,190 --> 01:17:51,790
and they would say rings around its of zero

1290
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:54,750
so if i tried to make you see it

1291
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:55,580
this would be

1292
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,410
center maximum

1293
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:59,750
it would be a ring around here

1294
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:01,420
complete darkness

1295
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,440
and then

1296
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,420
again a little bit of light

1297
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,830
not very much

1298
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:07,040
because remember

1299
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,140
this maximum is only four and a half percent of that one

1300
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:12,040
and then you would see again ring

1301
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:17,600
this complete darkness and so on

1302
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,870
so you have a little pinhole

1303
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,420
this is the image that you get on the screen

1304
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,500
from the pinhole

1305
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:29,560
you would think now that this

1306
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,330
from here to here

1307
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:35,600
state equals zero

1308
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:40,060
and we call that state of

1309
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:44,500
this is the state of always you first

1310
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:49,920
you would think that islam that divided by a if a is the diameter of

1311
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,960
european all

1312
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:56,370
well it's almost that it is a little larger because the pinhole circular geometry is

1313
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:58,500
different from the line

1314
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,150
and so take my word for it that it comes not at all level that

1315
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:07,210
divided by a but it comes roughly one point two level and divided by a

1316
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:10,100
you want to be picky it's really one point two two

1317
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,960
i'm that divided by a and this of course is in radians again i work

1318
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:18,730
in terms of gradients small angle approximation

1319
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,560
and so this raises the issue

1320
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:24,120
of what we call in physics angular resolution

1321
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,190
suppose i have the pinhole

1322
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:27,750
and i look

1323
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:30,600
at the images of two light sources

1324
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:32,460
one light comes in from there

1325
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,310
and you comes in from there could be the headlights of the car

1326
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:37,810
could be two stars in the sky

1327
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:42,170
well each one of them will give the diffraction pattern that's non-negotiable you can never

1328
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:47,540
bypass the fraction so one star will give the diffraction pattern here one headlight any

1329
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:50,210
other will give the diffraction pattern here

1330
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:51,920
you would have no problem

1331
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,500
to say we are the all the two light sources there's one star and there

1332
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,650
is another story

1333
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:02,000
now make the angle between the two sources smaller and smaller and and smaller and

1334
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:08,330
and smaller sorted these two diffraction patterns come closer and closer and closer and closer

1335
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:11,670
how close can you know bring them so did we

1336
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:13,790
you and i will still say

1337
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:16,290
still two sources

1338
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:18,890
we call that angular resolution

1339
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:23,960
and so how we define angular resolution is that both light sources have exactly the

1340
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:28,960
same strength and that's assume for now for simplicity that the monochromatic so that there

1341
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,080
is only one wavelength that they

1342
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:35,560
then the criterion that is generally accepted

1343
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,060
so that we can still

1344
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,620
the site that there are two light sources

1345
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,390
that this one

1346
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:43,170
the centre of this one

1347
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:44,730
it is not closer

1348
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,290
then the location

1349
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:48,180
gamma does not

1350
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,630
if there is no

1351
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,020
very from gamma

1352
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:57,530
this time

1353
01:20:57,580 --> 01:21:00,210
is not

1354
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:07,200
the with an arbitrary valid sequent and trying to find out

1355
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:08,260
proof of it

1356
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:13,450
i'm going to start arbitrary is not provable and construct model the future

1357
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:14,910
that way around

1358
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,710
it's easier

1359
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,780
i'm going to simplify further

1360
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:33,590
taking the a over to the site

1361
01:21:33,610 --> 01:21:37,540
right the sequence with two right hands tied to

1362
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,890
not a entails

1363
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,210
the bad guy

1364
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,680
tales everything

1365
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:47,820
it's going to follow usual practice by writing that with an empty right hand side

1366
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:49,500
so gamma delta is to

1367
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:57,110
gamma not a

1368
01:21:57,130 --> 01:21:59,180
is not satisfiable

1369
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:06,520
the not a here might as well be a member of gamma

1370
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:09,110
right i mean it's not doing anything now

1371
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:13,260
for all gamma

1372
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,820
is inconsistent

1373
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:28,000
then gamma

1374
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,300
it is

1375
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:40,370
is a syntactic notion has to do with the deduction it means there is a

1376
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:44,630
derivation of contradiction

1377
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,640
because there's nothing to do with

1378
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:49,900
tautologies and it is

1379
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:51,080
OK gamma

1380
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:54,140
from gamma you can derive a contradiction

1381
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:56,290
if the fans

1382
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,750
then gamma is unsatisfiable

1383
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,300
and i hope i've

1384
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,000
just the doctrine of steps

1385
01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:10,670
that you now believe

1386
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:15,840
to do

1387
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:22,130
since the doing work

1388
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:26,040
might as well

1389
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:32,750
the for all gamma holds in particular for gamma would not sign

1390
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:58,170
this is going to be the technique

1391
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:06,280
twenty minutes

1392
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:10,340
left of negations

1393
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:15,460
all this is being captured for posterity here slowness screws up

1394
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:29,910
now we're happy

1395
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,020
left office

1396
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,160
a stroke here

1397
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:38,160
right if gamma

1398
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:49,530
one of the forced to use it does not entail a contradiction

1399
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,580
then it's not

1400
01:24:55,500 --> 01:25:00,150
it's not unsatisfiable that is satisfiable

1401
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:04,340
so i'm going to suppose

1402
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,120
that there is no

1403
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:12,860
all contradictions

1404
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,890
from gamma

1405
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,350
and show

1406
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:19,760
that is satisfiable

1407
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:27,900
and i'm going to do it by cooking up

1408
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:31,630
domain and interpretation and uation

1409
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:33,870
for the evaluation

1410
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:35,750
will get

1411
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:40,070
for smoothing we can create a lot we can use a lot of algorithms and

1412
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:41,850
actually to be

1413
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:45,420
topic how to small language models

1414
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:46,680
but in

1415
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,830
all practice when

1416
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:54,570
creating greater when we are creating real operations usually people tend to use the simplest

1417
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:58,470
algorithms and the simplest is classes using

1418
01:25:58,490 --> 01:26:04,470
it's interesting that actually applies to thinking about this formula defines you

1419
01:26:04,530 --> 01:26:06,190
try to answer

1420
01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:08,950
a very important question

1421
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:11,730
what is the probability of

1422
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:14,370
the next sunrise

1423
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,030
every morning we see that the sun rises

1424
01:26:19,450 --> 01:26:22,950
the question is what this probability that it

1425
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,530
the domesday

1426
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:27,460
the last day of the universe and we not see

1427
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:30,090
on the next day

1428
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:34,200
and basic based on this philosophical questions

1429
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:35,680
he came to form

1430
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,150
two some form

1431
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:40,250
of the probability of the next day

1432
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:45,910
but for us it's more interesting probability of unseen words and

1433
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:51,750
we usually four or unseen growth we can say something like this person and number

1434
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:55,320
of seeing words in our collection

1435
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:58,030
another problem is that

1436
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,800
even for big fat

1437
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:02,570
and use using big says to him

1438
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:05,040
precise estimation

1439
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,190
always had some

1440
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:15,200
some the station in statistics and all a lot of different problems based on this

1441
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,140
fact that

1442
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:22,460
there are there and we don't have a lot of statistics for this work

1443
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,320
and if you have a virus or

1444
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:28,210
for example you have a collection of medium documents

1445
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:29,430
and some words

1446
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:32,550
four times

1447
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:35,800
and in other words in the same collection

1448
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:37,580
two times

1449
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:42,950
does it mean that this is the first work is twice more probable than the

1450
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:45,570
second one

1451
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:50,150
i think that's from the intuition that can say no it is not true

1452
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:52,860
it simply because

1453
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:56,820
we have one document that uses this around the world

1454
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,110
and we don't have

1455
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:02,390
more documents with the first part of something like this

1456
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:06,840
usually we need some additional smoothing tool

1457
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:09,230
compensate this effect

1458
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:12,890
and i don't want to talk a lot about it and if you really need

1459
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:15,610
this and if you really want to

1460
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:18,450
avoid this situation you need to

1461
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:22,830
but need to do a special research in this area or to use

1462
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,570
well known models

1463
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:26,310
by the way that just

1464
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,910
language models

1465
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:31,700
initial development of them

1466
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,450
the biggest progress

1467
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:36,560
was done in speech recognition

1468
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:40,470
because when doing speech recognition is very real

1469
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:41,940
previous work

1470
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:44,620
and we want to predict the next

1471
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:49,410
also you can look at this language models as one of the simplest variant of

1472
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:53,990
markov models and it is actually a markov model the simplest

1473
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,840
and of course you can

1474
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:58,740
use something more sophisticated

1475
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,430
trying to

1476
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:05,550
keep all our ideas very simple and durable in

1477
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:08,830
one day of programming

1478
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:09,950
OK so

1479
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:15,310
how we can present this data in our memory in our program

1480
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:17,410
so we have

1481
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:21,320
we can have by the way i forgot to say that

1482
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,850
we can have

1483
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:24,140
this an

1484
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:26,030
can be different ways

1485
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,460
so it can be a unigram model

1486
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:34,450
this is simply distribution of words by probability how probable problems arise

1487
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,480
it can be by gram

1488
01:29:36,490 --> 01:29:40,360
when you have probability of two work

1489
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:42,460
and so far

1490
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:47,620
and the a country this this a good thing that's not

1491
01:29:48,490 --> 01:29:52,620
how they can prevent this data in memory of our computers

1492
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,250
the simplest approach is

1493
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:57,600
use any of the

1494
01:29:57,620 --> 01:30:00,270
serious structure

1495
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,300
that we discussed on OWL

1496
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,830
second lecture

1497
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:06,390
and since work

1498
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,980
for all combinations of words for background model is the key

1499
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,470
and the probability is when

1500
01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:15,390
this is

1501
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,750
the simplest

1502
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:19,950
presentation of this information in memory

1503
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:20,970
it's pretty obvious

1504
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:25,970
so if you want to estimate some probability based on these models

1505
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:27,310
you can simply

1506
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:31,720
do a search in this model find it and get this probability

1507
01:30:31,730 --> 01:30:34,580
if you want to get probability for background

1508
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:38,860
three grand you simply doing the same search but you're

1509
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,660
the key is

1510
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:45,910
combination of two or three words

1511
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:48,570
how we can build this model

1512
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:52,850
OK using our infrastructure that we already have

1513
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:54,400
the o four hours

1514
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:55,970
doris search engine

1515
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:58,620
so we have some linear decision process

1516
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:03,060
creates a sequence of words was attribute

1517
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:04,280
and we simply

1518
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:07,740
using some sliding window or this

1519
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:10,740
four that getting from innovation

1520
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:13,770
and size of the windows one forward

1521
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:15,000
unigram model

1522
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:16,970
so in getting every word

1523
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:18,740
from our streams

1524
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:20,690
searching in our

1525
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:23,450
yes structure for this work

1526
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,000
look into

1527
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:27,960
count how many times this so this work

1528
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:33,410
as infantry this counter by what are every time and we see this right

1529
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:38,070
background models simply looking for towards creating this key

1530
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,520
searching in our

1531
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,410
index structure

1532
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:44,070
by this new key

1533
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:47,270
and well you can't

1534
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:49,980
so it's pretty simple really

1535
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:54,800
talking about the amount of memory for all four

1536
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:57,000
during in innovation

1537
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,230
they have some constant amount of

1538
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:01,170
memory for this

1539
01:32:01,190 --> 01:32:03,860
the problem is that

1540
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:06,800
actually don't have constant amount of

1541
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:09,250
memory for all n gram models

1542
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:12,980
because it can be actually huge

1543
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:15,210
that's smart enough

1544
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:18,980
you know how to handle this situation

1545
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:24,690
the remember when we were building inverted index and we decided that

1546
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:26,000
we cannot

1547
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:30,090
keep it in memory it can fit into all memory because

1548
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:34,730
four-year-old we need to understand the rates and mechanisms of reactions

1549
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:40,680
so this is going to competitiveness it's linked to resource utilization efficient use of materials

1550
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,750
and energy

1551
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:42,900
we know how to

1552
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:47,740
process things effectively the second thing is environment number of you've come to me after

1553
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:53,790
on different occasions spoken of you're interested in environmental matters one of the simplest things

1554
01:32:53,790 --> 01:33:00,830
one can do to minimize adverse environmental impact of chemical processes is to be efficient

1555
01:33:00,830 --> 01:33:05,240
so understanding how reactions proceed is critical in

1556
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:07,200
minimizing the adverse

1557
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:10,100
environmental impact

1558
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:13,900
so productivity issues

1559
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:18,180
secondly environmental issues

1560
01:33:18,730 --> 01:33:19,780
and thirdly

1561
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:22,700
societal issues societal issues

1562
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:28,400
you're here at MIT want to get an analytical education

1563
01:33:28,410 --> 01:33:30,350
and you want to go and do some

1564
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:31,610
o thing in the world

1565
01:33:31,650 --> 01:33:35,850
and one of the things that can happen if you understand your chemistry and understand

1566
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:39,120
the kinetics is you can keep

1567
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:44,660
a plant operative you can keep people working so there societal implications for

1568
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,040
failure to understand kinetics

1569
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:49,750
a process becomes

1570
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:54,470
obsolete you go out of business and people going to work so for these and

1571
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:55,740
many other reasons

1572
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:57,370
we want to study kinetics

1573
01:33:57,470 --> 01:33:59,210
and economics

1574
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:02,890
it takes place over a very wide range that's why i played this song about

1575
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,970
that's what this is about it's about time

1576
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:10,850
we have at the one extreme very slow chemical processes and at the other extreme

1577
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:17,270
very fast chemical processes slow we have things that take place so on geological or

1578
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:21,460
even cosmic time scales very very slow processes

1579
01:34:21,470 --> 01:34:23,370
on the other extreme we have

1580
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:26,110
such things as explosions

1581
01:34:26,150 --> 01:34:28,880
explosions and explosions are necessarily

1582
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:34,800
for example in the airbag that operates in automobile

1583
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:40,230
it operates thanks to the fast kinetics of the gas solid reaction there is no

1584
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:47,350
is no pump that can inflate an airbag an acceptably high rate to do you

1585
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:52,360
any good in an automobile crash what happens here is the kinetics of a reaction

1586
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:59,610
between two solid what we have is basically solid solid goes to gas

1587
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:03,380
and as you know the volume of the gas is thousands of times the volume

1588
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:05,900
of the solid and in particular

1589
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:08,960
it's the reaction of sodium a side with

1590
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:14,560
potassium nitrate and one of the products nitrogen gas in huge quantities

1591
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:20,990
so you accelerometer accelerometer decides that you're decelerating iterate that alarmingly high

1592
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:23,580
probably not healthy occasion

1593
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:28,340
tiny current a tiny current electric current flows through a wire which acts as the

1594
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:31,120
trigger for this reaction once the reaction goes

1595
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:35,420
you can inflate the airbag in a matter of millisecond so

1596
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,210
what we want to do is understand some of the basic cells

1597
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:44,720
of chemical kinetics and so let's start and we're looking at a a general reaction

1598
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:50,850
the general reaction to understand how first of all to characterize chemical reactions let's characterize

1599
01:35:50,890 --> 01:35:53,850
the rate of a chemical reaction so

1600
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:56,680
want write a little a is

1601
01:35:56,810 --> 01:36:03,210
stoichiometry and big a is some chemical identity so a models a plus b models

1602
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:06,890
react to form little little-seen moles of c

1603
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:08,980
plus little the moles of d

1604
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:10,850
that sort of

1605
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:16,020
prototypical reaction kinetics

1606
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:17,190
the kinetics

1607
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,550
accounts for

1608
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:21,490
the rate of convergence

1609
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,510
the rate of conversion

1610
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,850
that's what we want to know

1611
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:27,180
how quickly our we consuming are

1612
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:33,640
how quickly our we consuming our reactance how quickly are we

1613
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:36,570
generating our products

1614
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:41,180
so that's what we're interested in understanding so

1615
01:36:41,190 --> 01:36:45,600
we have first of all simple thing we have conservation of mass operating which we've

1616
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,050
seen from early part of the real line one that

1617
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:51,060
the rate of consumption

1618
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:56,010
the rate of consumption of all of the reactants

1619
01:36:56,020 --> 01:37:01,350
the rate of consumption of all of the reactants must equal the rate of production

1620
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,770
of all of products

1621
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:07,560
there's no sources are six we have no wormholes hear everything that goes into the

1622
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,850
plant has to come out of the plant in some other way

1623
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:16,090
and specifically we can even get into looking at the rate of disappearance of a

1624
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:20,670
single reactor so for example the stoichiometry would dictate that

1625
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:23,640
the rate at which i consume

1626
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:26,640
a this is one over a this is the

1627
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:31,600
three multiplayer times the change in the concentration i apologize for

1628
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:35,100
the multiple faster this case little c represents the

1629
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:40,060
stoichiometry in this case this represents concentration of

1630
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:45,110
the rate of change of concentration of a rate of its disappearance

1631
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:50,100
when is normalized from all number would be the same as the rate of appearance

1632
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:50,430
of the

1633
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:57,460
so the by dt of the concentration of these so we have these individual

1634
01:37:57,530 --> 01:38:01,260
relationship so this is simply conservation

1635
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,100
conservation of of mass

1636
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:06,870
conservation of mass so we have that

1637
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:09,420
now comes the

1638
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:16,130
o point of kinetic theory we can theory says is that there's is a relationship

1639
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:20,880
i think this is an example of a productive all-nighter and

1640
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,920
also this is this is an example of when it's the right choice the blow

1641
01:38:24,130 --> 01:38:28,150
your homework if anyone wishes to do things like this and be as productive you

1642
01:38:28,150 --> 01:38:32,770
are certainly entitled to blow up the homework here too so

1643
01:38:32,770 --> 01:38:35,420
but to bring in good data like this when you're done

1644
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:39,360
anyway this notion is the genetic map

1645
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:47,790
it was totally abstract concept much like mentals abstract concepts that there were even genes

1646
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:51,880
now we're going further saying whatever genes are we still don't know their DNA et

1647
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:55,520
cetera et cetera whatever they are they live online and they behave as if they

1648
01:38:55,520 --> 01:39:02,710
live on online and they undergo recombination cetera and when i see a recombination rate

1649
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:05,920
recombination frequency recombination rate

1650
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:12,170
it must mean the genes are very close together

1651
01:39:12,190 --> 01:39:17,190
if i see a recombination rate very very close never recombine recombination rates

1652
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:21,750
well i don't know maybe ten percent or something well there's some distance between

1653
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,940
and if they further and further and further away or in totally different chromosomes what

1654
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:28,130
would be the recombination rate here

1655
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:29,880
for two different chromosomes

1656
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:36,560
half of these are non parental types so when i get up to recombination rate

1657
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,840
of fifty percent

1658
01:39:38,860 --> 01:39:42,730
then it means that they live on

1659
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:46,380
they are so-called unlinked to each other

1660
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:50,460
either they're on different chromosomes entirely

1661
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:54,540
or i suppose it's possible in fact it is possible that they are so far

1662
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:57,170
on the same chromosome

1663
01:39:57,190 --> 01:40:00,630
the probability of crossovers occurring is so high

1664
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:05,860
that there'd correlated from each other and i can't observe any recombination rate less than

1665
01:40:05,860 --> 01:40:10,900
fifty percent it turns out many chromosomes are sufficiently big that lots of crossovers can

1666
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:15,630
occur and you can actually detect linkages the two ends of the chromosome but if

1667
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:18,580
you string together some genes in between you can see that this is linked to

1668
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:21,520
this linked to this is like this is linked to this system to this

1669
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,610
OK alright

1670
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:29,460
so started it is another one of my heroes because he comes up with this

1671
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:35,540
utterly abstract model here of chromosomes of genetic maps

1672
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:38,980
what's meant to get that point

1673
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:41,790
see some of the

1674
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:42,920
so can

1675
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:45,630
well first of all

1676
01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:47,110
you take

1677
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:48,880
section four

1678
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:54,650
this begins to provide a fairly convincing evidence for the chromosomal theory because it made

1679
01:40:54,650 --> 01:41:00,130
a whole lot of pretty wacky predictions and they pretty much holed up

1680
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:03,360
here's another thing that provide a lot of good evidence for

1681
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:05,310
and that

1682
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:07,590
was sex linkage

1683
01:41:07,710 --> 01:41:12,610
also in morgan's law

1684
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:15,590
which was a very productive play so much that

1685
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:24,150
folks wondering about the fact that chromosomes although they almost always occurred

1686
01:41:24,150 --> 01:41:25,560
in pairs

1687
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:28,290
the lined up with each other perfectly

1688
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:32,110
in many species there was one

1689
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:35,690
odd couple

1690
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:37,790
a pair of chromosomes

1691
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:42,090
always paired up with each other

1692
01:41:42,110 --> 01:41:45,560
but they didn't look the same

1693
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:51,090
this one looks like an axe

1694
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:53,500
this one kind of how the shape of y

1695
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:57,480
and hence they got the names the x and y chromosomes

1696
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:59,650
here was something very interesting

1697
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:03,980
in front flies it was always the males had next one

1698
01:42:04,670 --> 01:42:08,750
in females it was always in x

1699
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:10,500
what does that tell us

1700
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:13,880
about these chromosomes and what they do

1701
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:21,750
well what you believe to true

1702
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:25,590
just correlated with gender females have these two funny chromosomes

1703
01:42:25,630 --> 01:42:29,650
males have as a human females of these two axes males seven x and y

1704
01:42:29,730 --> 01:42:33,000
it doesn't have to mean that they determine gender

1705
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:36,320
maybe gender determines them

1706
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:39,420
maybe what happens is that in female cells

1707
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:43,510
you get both chromosomes but in male cells some some enzyme comes along and inches

1708
01:42:43,510 --> 01:42:45,650
off the end of the chromosome

1709
01:42:45,710 --> 01:42:49,000
yeah i mean this some physiological state

1710
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:52,860
of the chromosomes why why were you so ready to leap to the conclusion that

1711
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:58,840
the chromosomes determine sex rather than gender than the gender terms come

1712
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:01,590
because you know the answer you've been told all this et cetera but i again

1713
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:06,250
invite you to take apart what support you have and ask how would you know

1714
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:09,860
right all these things you get told that you know how to now and there

1715
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:12,690
was great argument about what is this really the case

1716
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:17,320
how could you convince people

1717
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,630
but this was true

1718
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:22,400
it's not obvious to know which way it would go

1719
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:28,900
the most convincing evidence not the only the most convincing evidence came from a single

1720
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:33,900
they had been isolated morgan's lab and have zero fly

1721
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:40,110
they had the very interesting property that instead of the normal red drosophila eyes this

1722
01:43:40,110 --> 01:43:42,200
basically it pays off only certain

1723
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:49,220
of a certain type of problems in certain scale so for small things like counting course sorting

1724
01:43:49,950 --> 01:43:52,960
probably could do would be good idea although technically you can do this

1725
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:56,560
no it's

1726
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:58,250
and so on

1727
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,290
this is the idea itself

1728
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:01,310
not as much

1729
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:05,600
on the level of functional logic or procedural

1730
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:10,390
it's more like how you split how you will reformulate your problem

1731
01:44:11,090 --> 01:44:13,390
in the way they are so you have input data

1732
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:15,040
and you try to solve something

1733
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:16,360
now the point is

1734
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:20,000
the dual first that that's why it's called mapreduce

1735
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:22,540
first you'll met these data are

1736
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,130
basically split the data into

1737
01:44:26,410 --> 01:44:27,450
many chunks

1738
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:29,390
all smaller problems

1739
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:33,110
and then you'll well reduce the solutions

1740
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:35,710
the particular solution simple

1741
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:37,990
the final solution so

1742
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:41,880
in old fashioned way which almost nobody

1743
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:46,370
using this term anymore in this context is this dividing can conquer

1744
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:47,720
paradigm of

1745
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:51,030
programming i mean this is the underlying intuition

1746
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:54,260
is that it's nice nicely

1747
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:03,210
are nicely these paradigms nicely mapped into these distributed processing platform

1748
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:06,150
let's see

1749
01:45:07,530 --> 01:45:08,740
gotta do this if it's

1750
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,740
processing conferences and

1751
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:17,090
are data mining car talked with guys so usually they would have standard algorithms

1752
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,090
reformulated in this fashion so this would be that difficult paradigm

1753
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:28,540
usually wouldn't get new algorithms just that all the algorithms reformulated in this way and then they

1754
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:31,160
and discover uh

1755
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:33,960
among some data

1756
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,660
another level in this pipeline we set so

1757
01:45:42,690 --> 01:45:47,210
how to store the data so high-performance schema-free database is the so-called

1758
01:45:47,690 --> 01:45:50,980
no ask classical databases these are the ones which

1759
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:59,020
got quite popular in the last couple of years and now what are the typical characteristics of this

1760
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:02,630
very can add something to this

1761
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:04,370
the first

1762
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:07,770
the idea is to support large amounts of data

1763
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:10,870
most of them can really support large amounts of data then

1764
01:46:12,070 --> 01:46:16,160
why they're called the west quite because mostly they have this ground interface although

1765
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:18,870
this is even changing all this i think that

1766
01:46:22,830 --> 01:46:26,030
so here you can see mongol be basically the use jason

1767
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:33,810
simple enough so nobody they care to know spend like three days writing proper passes over the edges

1768
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:35,770
jason pazis so

1769
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,030
this is my understanding why the hinges

1770
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,250
and jason is simple enough

1771
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:44,320
then they operate in distributed infrastructures like on top of hadoop

1772
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:51,350
based on these key value pairs so there's no pre-defined schema which is

1773
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:56,520
of course suitable far linked open data which i'm sure you've heard these days about

1774
01:46:57,450 --> 01:47:00,220
so that no pre-defined schema means that no

1775
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:04,960
you've no extra wear hats one later on when you're changing the

1776
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:09,410
when changing the problems are adapting the problem

1777
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:11,150
the flexible and fast

1778
01:47:12,530 --> 01:47:15,010
you have plenty of implementations

1779
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:19,810
well here i forgot to mention the

1780
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:20,640
over them

1781
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:28,950
plentiful implementation new new ones are coming i would say so here's an example of

1782
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:31,740
session with mongol be

1783
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:35,280
around mungo

1784
01:47:38,410 --> 01:47:41,870
for instance with this statement you save name peaks warden

1785
01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:42,890
i ze blue

1786
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:47,080
drop in hand with the next sentence

1787
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:50,140
i say find me something with

1788
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:52,810
peter ward and and you get back dobj

1789
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:55,490
this is pretty much the whole the whole

1790
01:47:57,140 --> 01:47:57,970
paradigm so

1791
01:47:58,850 --> 01:48:02,870
everything is the same as it used to be that works fine fast

1792
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:04,510
distributed fashion

1793
01:48:05,470 --> 01:48:06,240
and so

1794
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:11,450
not many services are extra analytics services and so on are on the top of

1795
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:14,350
let's say and tools like all the elements so one would have

1796
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:19,260
more like this lightweight reasoning on top of it which is already

1797
01:48:19,970 --> 01:48:21,850
more sophisticated and many of those

1798
01:48:23,370 --> 01:48:26,910
but i get the new ones are coming which will have even even more

1799
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:31,670
so i've already shown you this example before

1800
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:34,530
and i also shown this

1801
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:36,630
also if we now substitute

1802
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:38,940
this thing

1803
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:42,730
this upper bound of the growth function and growth function remember was almost the same

1804
01:48:42,730 --> 01:48:47,300
up to the door and has the shattering coefficient so remember all that we derive

1805
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:49,340
the shattering coefficient

1806
01:48:49,550 --> 01:48:50,640
we can

1807
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:54,430
now all the shattering coefficient in terms of the VC dimension in the balkans like

1808
01:48:55,710 --> 01:49:02,290
which should be what i showed you before in my my powerpoint slides

1809
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:03,960
it tells us

1810
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:06,900
test correspondent from both the training error plus

1811
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:09,070
this complexity to

1812
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:11,960
depending on the VC dimension

1813
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:13,470
so it's

1814
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:16,460
one interesting thing about all this businesses

1815
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:21,600
that originally about in germany started by

1816
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:25,250
studying the consistency of empirical risk minimisation

1817
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:29,760
so here is some limitations first me one of which may be the simplest induction

1818
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,720
principle that you can imagine just minimize the training error

1819
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:36,550
it is natural to ask the question does this work or not

1820
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:40,800
this shows us that if the VC dimension is finite

1821
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:45,410
it this goes to infinity this quantity goes to zero so then in the limit

1822
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:47,330
for all functions of the

1823
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:50,680
learning machine test are in training are all the same

1824
01:49:50,690 --> 01:49:52,500
in probability

1825
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:57,460
so they found out that this is consistent empirical risk minimization but actually

1826
01:49:57,470 --> 01:50:01,990
by doing so since everything that did was valid also for finite sample sizes it's

1827
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:05,570
just not just an asymptotic theory

1828
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:09,330
they they actually came up with something that you could also

1829
01:50:09,330 --> 01:50:10,630
used to improve

1830
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:13,850
in the finite sample case so to actually

1831
01:50:13,850 --> 01:50:18,630
come up with different adaptive principle minimize the training error minimize something that involves the

1832
01:50:18,630 --> 01:50:22,660
training error and at the same time tries to control the complexity

1833
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:25,600
one of the learning machine

1834
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:27,440
it's called

1835
01:50:27,470 --> 01:50:30,330
structural risk minimisation

1836
01:50:30,330 --> 01:50:35,690
and it's something that people usually don't do in practice people often come up with

1837
01:50:35,690 --> 01:50:41,160
arguments a well this three something like structures decision to support vector machine is example

1838
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:42,060
of that

1839
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:47,280
but in the in the showcase you would have a nested set of functions

1840
01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:52,040
if you move to the right set of functions gets larger

1841
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:57,190
therefore also the VC dimension gets larger because if you can show a set of

1842
01:50:57,190 --> 01:51:02,250
points so if you can classify a set of points in all possible ways

1843
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:06,100
using this set of functions then you can also do it using this of functions

1844
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:08,660
because every function that's in here is also here

1845
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:11,870
but you might be able to still do it for larger sets of points with

1846
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:16,530
the function space is large so the VC dimension increases the right

1847
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:22,750
at the same time this capacity term in my bones the square root

1848
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:27,130
it had on the right-hand side will increase with the VC dimension

1849
01:51:27,150 --> 01:51:32,480
and the bound which is the sum of this training our capacity to when they

1850
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:34,500
behave like this

1851
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:40,370
so as i move to the right i will always pick the best function from

1852
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:42,010
the corresponding set

1853
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:44,320
we see dimension increases

1854
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:48,900
training error will probably decrease because if i that this function from largest that i

1855
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:51,870
can potentially find better function

1856
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:56,380
so there will be some kind of trade and at some point you will have

1857
01:51:56,400 --> 01:52:00,290
the smallest possible upper bounding the risk and the

1858
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:01,590
you could you could say

1859
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:02,750
let's go with this

1860
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:05,590
we don't know the risk but least we have an upper bound

1861
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:11,350
was the message from all this

1862
01:52:11,370 --> 01:52:13,660
if you think about this pond again

1863
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:19,070
you want to generalize so what's important to you want to generalize you should be

1864
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:23,030
working with the function class which has small capacity

1865
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:25,190
for instance measured by VC dimension

1866
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:28,560
yet at the same time the function class should be able

1867
01:52:28,570 --> 01:52:31,250
to explain the given training data

1868
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:35,760
these are two conflicting goals and and probably you can only do this if someone

1869
01:52:35,850 --> 01:52:39,650
can guess something about your problem if you have some prior knowledge

1870
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:41,970
so if you can choose some

1871
01:52:41,970 --> 01:52:45,970
functions that you think are reasonable for they could be smooth functions if you think

1872
01:52:45,970 --> 01:52:47,860
the problem move

1873
01:52:47,870 --> 01:52:51,850
then you might be able to get away with the small function class

1874
01:52:51,910 --> 01:52:54,350
small VC dimension at the same time

1875
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:59,600
as being able to explain the data if you can do this in your business

1876
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:03,350
so it's all about choosing good function classes

1877
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:06,600
which is the same as choosing priors essentially

1878
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:10,510
so for instance if we go back to this

1879
01:53:10,530 --> 01:53:12,990
linear classifiers of separating

1880
01:53:14,490 --> 01:53:16,150
but in

1881
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:18,580
r two that we step three

1882
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:21,830
in our and VC dimension n plus one

1883
01:53:23,490 --> 01:53:27,760
in high dimensional feature space they would have large VC dimension but as i mentioned

1884
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:29,090
already before

1885
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:33,020
if they induce large margin of separation they have

1886
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:38,060
small capacity actually what should be measuring them using the VC dimension but i want

1887
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:40,810
to introduce the capacity measures now

1888
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:46,670
and that's the basis of support vector machines and other kernel machines

1889
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:52,800
and it's a little bit but actually i could stop at this point and

1890
01:53:52,810 --> 01:53:55,800
we can have some discussion of some questions

1891
01:53:55,810 --> 01:53:57,810
it's time for you know

1892
01:53:57,830 --> 01:54:12,290
so thank you very much for your attention so far

1893
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:21,370
so don't be shy
