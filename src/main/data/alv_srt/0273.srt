1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,410
o whether the signs of the same for the signs are different

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,370
so what we have at that point is this sinusoid

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,460
it's really a sinusoidal carrier with transmitting at

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,020
this term here

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,500
is really something which expands and contracts slowly

6
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,580
so it's the beat

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,680
which says that if you're transmitting

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,890
from this source

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,450
at at the receiver

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,010
what you're hearing

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,400
there's something which

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,770
which contracts

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,690
then contracts then expands again there's nothing you can do about that problem either

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,360
there's just no energy they're part of the time

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,100
and this

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,090
and the sign term here

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,640
running along

18
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,110
sort of

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,870
changing from maximum to minimum

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:13,430
but if you millisecond time period if you have this vehicle traveling at sixty kilometres

21
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,050
sixty kilometres

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,600
sixty kilometres per hour

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,530
OK so you just work out the numbers there with the velocity of light in

24
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,840
all of that stuff

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:32,470
you find that you really can't communicate over yourself in that situation

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,090
because of these beat frequencies

27
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,330
it's it's too fast

28
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,250
it's it's

29
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,010
it is too slow

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,760
two ignoring right over it and it's too fast

31
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,400
to be able to get all of your data transmitted before it happens

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,320
so it's sort of this is a catastrophe

33
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,110
so that's what happens because of doppler shift

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,250
you get a response which is periodically fading

35
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,190
the doppler frequency this is called multipath fading are fast fading

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,370
called fast fading because it happened so fast

37
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,570
it is called multipath fading because it happens because of multiple pairs

38
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,430
which each have

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,450
lines which are changing relative to each other

40
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,040
OK let's go back

41
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,670
and look at the

42
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,030
look at the thing we had before

43
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,630
we just had a moving antenna

44
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,020
OK here you have shift also

45
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,680
why doesn't bother you

46
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,140
here you have the doppler shift

47
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,920
and your transmitting

48
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,110
i said gigahertz

49
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,410
and what the receiver is getting

50
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,460
is it gigahertz minus

51
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,880
so perhaps the colour something

52
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,140
OK so why isn't that problem

53
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,610
if i if i demodulate

54
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,580
at the carrier frequency

55
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,080
i'm sort of in bad luck because i have

56
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:19,150
a signal in which is changing very rapidly i have something which looks like

57
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,920
a time varying system

58
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,580
but what's going to happen

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,840
if i use the same kind of frequency recovery system we talked about earlier

60
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,650
frequency recovery system has all the time in the world

61
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,920
the track

62
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,600
that frequency which is one gigahertz minus the colour

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,570
track perfectly

64
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,200
which says the what happens is we start out with the signal

65
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,190
we move it up in frequency by one gigahertz

66
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,590
the doppler shift move down by color heard

67
00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:01,070
we track that frequency then we move it down again by gigahertz minus colour hertz

68
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,450
and everything works fine and nobody even knows it is any doppler shift there

69
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,630
OK so the problem is not that shift

70
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,490
the problem is multiple doppler shifts which are at different speeds relative to each other

71
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,840
that's an important point and we will

72
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,090
come back to it as we move along

73
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,510
if you put all of those faces we neglected

74
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,450
in the analysis the we just went through

75
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,530
this is the equation that arises

76
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,860
i write stand up because it's important

77
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,510
because the node this in lecture twenty

78
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,150
having governor

79
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,090
because they

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,450
because in the sign term fails to put an iron which should be there

81
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,420
and this is the correct term

82
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,530
and that is off by ninety degrees

83
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,010
so if you

84
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,010
if you write this down

85
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,130
you will end

86
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,880
see what's going on

87
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,340
so equation seven nodes

88
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,030
as hasn't the to the two pi

89
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,190
after a minus b over c

90
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,650
which is not

91
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,550
the right thing

92
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,380
OK as we said the fading is due to the doppler spread between different parents

93
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,840
the single doppler shift does not bother at all

94
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,320
if you have a vehicle

95
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,050
which is traveling away

96
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,090
from the standing in ten

97
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,610
and you have some kind of reflector

98
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,280
which is not something you're running into which is the which is the reflector above

99
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,070
the reflector below or something like that the thing which is going to happen is

100
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,570
that both of those hands and

101
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,700
we're going to have roughly the same doppler shift in the

102
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,630
they both have roughly the same doppler shift

103
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,840
it's not going to be this kind of the cancellation so we have here which

104
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,090
is something you really can't get rid of

105
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,760
OK and the other thing this points out again

106
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,570
is that this variation

107
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,450
it's going to be in terms of minutes

108
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,260
four seconds

109
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,990
and anything you're going to track the signal is going to be adequate for that

110
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,530
until you get to the point where there just isn't enough energy anymore

111
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,470
and then of course you have to move to a different base station or something

112
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:31,690
OK i want to go through one more example

113
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,470
of electromagnetism because it's so surprising this was surprising to me when i found this

114
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,590
if you have sending ten

115
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,450
i think this is the base station which is high up about

116
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,800
maybe fifty meters or something

117
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,360
it's sending

118
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,400
some receive antennas

119
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:58,450
which is at some height above the ground usually quite a bit smaller

120
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,970
and suppose there's some

121
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,240
more or less partly reflecting plane like a rose

122
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,380
so so here we have the vehicle

123
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,880
which is traveling along the road

124
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,970
and we have a standing in ten

125
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,450
which is also close to the road which is sending the signal so we have

126
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,820
two pairs

127
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,340
one which is a direct path from sending antenna to receive antenna and the other

128
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,530
is the reflecting path which goes down here

129
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,220
it comes back up again

130
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,170
OK well the rather surprising thing here

131
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,950
thing that i couldn't believe what i saw because it contradicted all of my intuition

132
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,050
is the one gets quite big

133
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,130
the difference between these two path lengths

134
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,620
on the mass

135
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,880
and that is both

136
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,290
very nonintuitive with some of the piles of your car

137
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,130
does not matter

138
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,380
and that i

139
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,110
ask you the question to explain in your assignment number three

140
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,880
why race cars very y times there must be a reason for that

141
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,730
what you to think about

142
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,030
there is another way

143
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,230
that one can measure the

144
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,030
friction coefficient

145
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,320
which is

146
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,620
three more complicated and really that's not the reason why

147
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,320
i want you to see it

148
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,910
the reason why i want you to

149
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,840
go with me through these argument is that you begin to see how subtle

150
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,600
and how really difficult

151
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,840
friction is

152
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,060
i'm going to

153
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,060
put an object now

154
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,160
on an incline again

155
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,240
as we did before

156
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,380
instead of having it

157
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,830
sit on its own

158
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,570
i'm going to attached to it

159
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,980
a history

160
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,750
he was that object

161
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,740
he was strange

162
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,520
and appalling

163
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,840
and here restrict

164
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,970
he is an objec mass and two

165
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,340
this object

166
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,660
has mass and one

167
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,490
and the angle here

168
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,740
i'm looking for my green charles i want to use the same color convention

169
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,110
let's look at all the forces that we can think of uris and one gene

170
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,470
that's decompose that in y and x direction

171
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,770
and i will call

172
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,350
in this direction why as i always do perpendicular to the surface

173
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,530
we call this why

174
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,920
and i call this direction now

175
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,060
the positive x direction

176
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,470
you are free to choose any way you want

177
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,130
force here

178
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,500
and now comes the major problems

179
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,330
the biggest problem is

180
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,830
that you do not know in advance

181
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,510
whether this system will start to accelerate in this direction

182
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,130
what it will start to accelerate in this direction

183
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,610
or whether it will not accelerate at all

184
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,570
it's quite possible

185
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,970
and all these three cases as you will see have to be dealt with independently

186
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,070
you cannot do it was one equation as you will see

187
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,270
that first

188
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,280
decompose this force as we did before

189
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,440
in the y direction

190
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,790
so this one

191
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,010
equals and one gene

192
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,490
cosine of

193
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,120
and this one

194
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,720
x component using the minus x direction now

195
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,240
because and one

196
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,360
this one and one g cosine of how we never have to worry about there

197
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,770
is no acceleration in the y direction

198
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,220
so this normal force and

199
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,700
we'll kill this one

200
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,220
this is an one

201
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,280
the cosine of never have to worry about the y direction we notice no acceleration

202
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,650
we only deal with forty x direction

203
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,970
but have interest

204
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,620
there is a tension

205
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,120
in this string

206
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,730
now comes the problem

207
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,110
i don't know

208
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,760
in what direction the frictional forces

209
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,840
if this object has the tendency to go uphill

210
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,320
which i don't know yet

211
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:26,170
and the frictional forces in this direction because it poses always the direction in which

212
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,760
the object wants to go

213
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,590
if however this object wants to go in this direction which i don't know

214
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,460
then the frictional force has to be put in this direction

215
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,570
i don't

216
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,100
i know that

217
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,010
the only thing i do now

218
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,810
is that the maximum value

219
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,010
of the fraction

220
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,010
will be

221
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,690
new static

222
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,200
and which is what we

223
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,790
their remember that's the

224
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,900
maximum values that the friction can have times and one g

225
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,390
that i know

226
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,540
so now if i want to do is this

227
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,240
i have two

228
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,580
look at

229
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,540
three completely different situations

230
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,310
acceleration in this direction

231
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,630
in which the fraction is

232
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
we can here

233
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:17,540
acceleration in this direction in which the friction is pointing there were no acceleration at

234
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,020
there's also of course the tension here

235
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,770
this tension is exactly the same as that should discussed the last time i will

236
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,270
not go over that because this is an ideal

237
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,950
and of course on physical situation the poorly has no mass

238
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,870
forty is completely frictionless

239
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,070
and history

240
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,400
there's no mass to mass was street

241
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,080
and i argued last time

242
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,560
tension here

243
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,860
must be the same as attention there

244
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,860
we even know the attention

245
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,830
i'm going to evaluate for now only situations that the system is at rest

246
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,120
it's not yet

247
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,840
if the system is addressed

248
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,660
t must be and two gene because this object is not being accelerated

249
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,170
so we already know

250
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,660
that's all situations where the system is addressed

251
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,340
must be

252
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,860
she is non-negotiable this t

253
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,860
as well as that

254
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,520
i have to start splitting

255
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,920
in the following situation

256
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,560
my first option is

257
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,360
i make the assumption

258
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,810
that the system

259
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,420
is gn

260
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,100
just about

261
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,260
start accelerating upwards

262
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,440
it isn't doing it yet

263
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,400
it is just about to do that

264
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,020
if that's the case

265
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,150
then i know

266
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,300
that's the frictional force

267
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,120
will be in this direction

268
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,440
and it will have reached the maximum value

269
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,410
with the static friction coefficient

270
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,540
now i can write down in the x direction

271
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,920
system you will transform it

272
00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:01,300
with regard to the alignment in order to get the results from the aligned ontology

273
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:08,680
but there are more recent application like peer-to-peer information sharing where you annotate your your

274
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,850
resources with some particular ontology but someone want to kill query from the standpoint of

275
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,100
another ontology OK so they will again using the alignment in order to transform the

276
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:26,990
query and get the results and they're all the same like web service composition you've

277
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:40,420
certainly already but mediation you take the guy in order to this one service into

278
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,100
the format of the input of the next one and i will talk about the

279
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,800
next one agent communication that transformation ontology evolution

280
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,120
so let's talk

281
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:59,410
this typically what i mentioned four catalogue integration you've got a particular database was your

282
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:05,360
your your product that you want to and it's written according to one scheme

283
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,860
and another marketplace use another schema

284
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,880
so what you do is that

285
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,850
what you want to do first is to to be able to export to do

286
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,920
all the database and information that you have in in order to do so

287
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:23,850
you will match the two on the two scheme order two ontologies you generate an

288
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,530
alignment and from this alignment you would be able to generate a transformation that we

289
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,130
do the work OK

290
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,740
and of course if one of the change you can we do the operation and

291
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,000
returned from the dead

292
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,400
you can do

293
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,360
it in query answering what i mentioned already what you want to do is as

294
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,510
everyone to issues a query towards another one but they use different ontology so what

295
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,900
you need is mediator that we reformulated query

296
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,420
and may be reformulated answer if it is necessary

297
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,610
and in this case again

298
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:04,250
you imagine two ontologies of two schema you will generate an alignment and you will

299
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,180
generate from this immediately so you can see the advantage of having this intermediate alignments

300
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,930
stuff in the middle of k

301
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,030
that is if you already got an alignment between these two ontologies and you can

302
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:21,110
generate immediately without doing the matching and also if it is part of pilot format

303
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,730
you can generate alignment with several different matching systems

304
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:31,110
and the last example goes with the agent communication you've got to agents using different

305
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:36,090
ontologies and what you want to do when you send a message to someone is

306
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:40,880
to be able to translate it into with regard to the target ontology

307
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:46,190
for doing this again you will do the same scene matching the ontology generate alignment

308
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:52,240
and generator transformation or you can do something different you would generate axioms that will

309
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,560
help the second agent to interpret the message without translation

310
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,370
so this is all the kind of application where you can involve ontology alignment and

311
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,630
it's always the same kind of process that you consider

312
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,590
and now natasha wylde

313
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,740
i tell you now

314
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,100
not how it is used but how to do it

315
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:25,280
now that you've somewhat convinced hopefully hopelessly is that this is something that that's that's

316
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,760
something that really need to do and the

317
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,160
ontology alignment is really a key component of a lot of this integration tasks

318
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,490
i want to talk about why is it difficult and why

319
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,050
you know any time you open the proceedings of the

320
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:43,300
semantic web conference is always least several papers on this topic whether the ontology matching

321
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,190
workshop every year attracts so many people

322
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,220
because it's far from a solved problem and so

323
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,400
to give an example of the types of difference is that we need to come

324
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,550
before on in this very simple case of two

325
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:02,300
very simple representations of conference sessions so let's let's take a look at these two

326
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,510
of ontologies so

327
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,700
first you know session in london sessions of the different names for essentially the same

328
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,290
concepts so then c

329
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,820
location in both places represented differently so the name of the properties different has location

330
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,690
location and also the weights represented as different iron one just string and another clays

331
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,040
players in other cases the instance of some class place

332
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:37,370
similarly the way time and it is represented in one case it's you know it's

333
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,800
value in another case it's actually an instance of another

334
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,130
class and complex object there

335
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:49,140
so for something you get this thing of trying to to figure out automatically trying

336
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,480
do you put two plus two to get for how you compose different facts on

337
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,560
the web to draw

338
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:59,530
conclusion that not explicitly stated at all

339
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,270
so let's start with entity resolution again this is part of the dissertation of alex

340
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:09,290
yates are basic idea is that we can determine the two objects are likely to

341
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:14,360
be the same one based on the relationships we find the textrunner runners found this

342
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,440
is related to earlier work by pantel and lin some technical differences but that is

343
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,240
not critically important right now so the basic idea is if i have a bunch

344
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,600
of these triples about x and i know that x was born in nineteen forty

345
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,400
one is the cities in the US is a friend of joe and have another

346
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,720
entity let's call it and for some of these facts are true but

347
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:42,390
m is also a friend of mary is basically the observation is that the probability

348
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,790
that x and they are the same is some function of the number of shared

349
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,190
and we can make this

350
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,730
a lot more sophisticated we can look at functional relationships rates effects and have the

351
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,890
same spouse

352
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,700
then that further increases the likelihood that they're the same person and so on and

353
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,480
so on so basic relational model the nice thing about this again is this is

354
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,290
completely generic we don't need hand labeled data we don't need specificity to a particular

355
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,930
domain this is for arbitrary entities in the web corpus and in fact we have

356
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:21,910
run resolver on our entire corpus another elegant thing here is you can do the

357
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,710
dual of this and applied to relations so here's the schematic example of two relations

358
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,790
are in our prime

359
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,570
and if they both apply between one and two

360
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,810
two and four et cetera et cetera i'm going to conclude that the probability that

361
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:41,650
relations are the same is again a direct function of the number of shared arguement

362
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,510
and in fact is the natural mutual recursion here between these two parts of the

363
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,670
algorithm writers you discover the more entities of the same you can then use that

364
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,790
to discover the more relationships are likely to be the same and you can go

365
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,280
backwards and forwards

366
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,840
so we have here this unsupervised probabilistic model the algorithm here is actually order and

367
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,040
log n so it's not entirely linear but still easy to run on millions and

368
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,070
tens of millions of documents

369
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,350
the next one probability of correctness so how likely is it that in extraction that

370
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:22,440
we get is is correct and that's kind of a subtle question even what is

371
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:29,780
correct means correct mean true doesn't mean a true truth preserving transformation on on the

372
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,740
original sentence right if i see

373
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:37,930
the sentence you know JFK was killed by elvis what exactly my supposed to

374
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:44,310
extract from that sentence right and we've mainly focused on on truth preserving notion of

375
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:49,330
correct strike we're going to be trying to do an accurate reflection of

376
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,650
what's in the text and a lot of factors to consider if you do this

377
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:58,430
analysis to state authority state this of the source there's your confidence and extraction method

378
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,580
but i'm going to show you now

379
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,330
is how we utilize the redundancy in the web corpus we ask

380
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,660
OK what's the number

381
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,410
independent extractions that you've gone and how is likelihood of correctness a function of

382
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,410
and this idea of counting extractions is actually not a new idea if you start

383
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:26,400
with lexico syntactic patterns which is an old idea goes back to the mat hurst

384
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,780
back in ninety two the idea is you have a sentence cities such as seattle

385
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,350
and boston and that contains the clue right that seattle and boston our cities right

386
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,020
such as their means that we have some class

387
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:42,500
in seattle and boston are members of the class

388
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:48,010
well does kinds of patterns are hints as to the meaning of the sentence they

389
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:55,210
suggest extractions now peter turney back in two thousand tunisian paper developed the PMI IR

390
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,580
algorithm the basic idea there was that could take

391
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:06,400
pointwise mutual information which we can just approximators co occurrence frequencies of different strings his

392
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,970
idea was you can estimate those from the number of results you get from a

393
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,050
search engine

394
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:17,070
OK and then based on the number of results you can compute confidence and membership

395
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,120
of the class so basically what this means is we're going to go to our

396
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:26,150
favourite search engine and type in the phrase for example cities such as seattle and

397
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,940
we'll look at the number of results that comes back in if that number is

398
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,360
higher than it is for some other string and cities such as avocado then we're

399
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,710
going to

400
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,100
be more confident in its elasticity than that of ocado the city and if you

401
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,870
play these kinds of games and lots of people have you find that these co-workers

402
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,870
frequencies are actually very telling

403
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:54,430
about what's what among the strings so the next step is we actually formalise this

404
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,570
and this gets very complicated in a hurry but you can actually as the following

405
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:04,030
precise question if you have some extraction x and it occurs k times in a

406
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,560
set of n

407
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,790
this thing sentences in each of these sentence has this kind of lexico syntactic extraction

408
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,270
patterns so each of them is basically suggesting that acts as a member of some

409
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:19,290
class what's actually the probability that x belongs to the class and again by class

410
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,190
i mean something like cities or can be

411
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,050
strings that belong to relation like mayor of the city

412
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,780
and by the way one really important thing here is that we only count

413
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,260
and this and that's what i'm trying to highlight their distinct sentences right if you

414
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,210
have a lot of copying of the web and we're we're that obviously and so

415
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:42,370
you don't want to be counting the same sentences just because it's been copied lots

416
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,830
of times but if we count distinct sentences it turns out that we can develop

417
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,240
combinatorial model recall there is model because it's the balls and earns type of model

418
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,100
i won't go through into the formal details but i'll just show you the the

419
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,540
punch line here

420
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:02,530
we can actually have a closed form expression for if x appears k times in

421
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:07,200
and draws a ball from the urn in other words in it appears k times

422
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,900
and extraction from out of extractions that we conclude that the probability is this nasty

423
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,090
looking expression haven't even define the notation here i'm not expecting you to read this

424
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:23,890
i just want to be impressed by our our equations get all refer to the

425
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:28,060
paper for further details if you do look at for second you see the does

426
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:33,250
behave in sort of reasonable ways you see that the answer the probability do increase

427
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,800
exponentially with k

428
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,890
right we in other words the more times

429
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:44,660
we see seattle being appearing in the sentence cities such as seattle we become exponentially

430
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,830
more confident in the fact that cells the city

431
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:53,200
the nodes also decrease exponentially with the number of extractions if a source seattle being

432
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,760
typically logical we want to do is one answer questions of the form

433
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:01,080
given this knowledge base is the following gradient entailed given what i know about this

434
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,740
patient that she has breast cancer or this you know breast cancer or maybe i

435
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,760
just don't know

436
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,700
OK so usually this these are the kinds of questions that we're trying to answer

437
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,790
propositional logic is very nice and simple it's also you know not very compact way

438
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,870
to say most things are very transparent way the same most things what people use

439
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,010
most of the time is first order logic

440
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,080
in first order logic we have all the structure that we just saw from propositional

441
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,470
logic but in addition to atoms now have internal structure

442
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,660
and that is no longer just the simple

443
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,740
but it's a predicate symbol followed by a list of arguments which can be other

444
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,830
variables or constants

445
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:44,790
so for example friends anna bob is the predicate and friends is the predicate symbol

446
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,660
this is an active friends and and actor

447
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,830
and is the constant and x is the variable

448
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,580
and we're going to call ground at

449
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,810
and that's where all the arguments are constants for example friends and x is not

450
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,560
around them but if i replace x by bob

451
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,870
friends anna bob now is the ground after and again we're going to be concerned

452
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,640
with ground atoms here

453
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,140
now in addition to athens not having internal structure we have two new connectors which

454
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,510
are the quantifiers

455
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,640
the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier

456
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,560
so for example if i write

457
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,470
for all for all x friends and x this means that and this friends with

458
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,990
everybody and if i right there exists an x such that friends and x this

459
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,120
means that a has at least one friend

460
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,620
and in this talk i'm going to focus on finite domains and interpretations if you

461
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,510
don't know what this means don't worry about it because it won't matter if you

462
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,830
know what this means and you know what i say

463
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,580
so the way

464
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,390
we are going to extend first-order logic to handle uncertainties by combining it with markov

465
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,700
so here is just a couple and then everybody knows about markov networks was that

466
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,560
he has a couple of slides just to get

467
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,580
you know the basics the and the

468
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,120
you know terminology down

469
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,660
so markov network is an undirected graphical model there's an old for every variable

470
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,010
and there's an another between any two variables that have direct dependence on each other

471
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,040
and the arts and direct

472
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,330
two two sets of nodes are conditionally independent given the third set iff when i

473
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,680
removed the third set from the graph the remaining graphs are are separated

474
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,390
so independence is just graph separation very simple

475
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,950
so the graph tells me what conditional independencies hold

476
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:29,290
the the parameters of the distribution are specified using what are called potential function

477
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,030
there's the potential function for every clique in the graph

478
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,760
a quick being completely connected set of nodes so this one click which is as

479
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,970
the cancer half

480
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:39,930
and like one click that smoking cancer

481
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,450
and potentials can take on any nonnegative real values so they don't they can be

482
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,560
more than one

483
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,370
so assuming that all the various

484
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,850
variables are billions

485
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,850
here's the potential table for smoking can possible potential table

486
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:58,080
and you'll see that that's what it's really doing is just assigning a lower value

487
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,540
through the state smoking chewing cancer false

488
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,220
and the way to think intuitively about potentials is that the value of the potential

489
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,410
state represents all compatible

490
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,080
the values in that state

491
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,450
for example because smoking causes cancer having smoking and not having cancer these two things

492
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,470
are less compatible than the others and that's why this has a lot of

493
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,540
another probability of the complete state is just the product

494
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,640
of the clique potentials for the for the states of the cliques in that

495
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,450
of course there a little problem here which is that with all this reason that

496
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,430
we have

497
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,830
the sum of the probabilities of all states is not necessarily one

498
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:41,260
and so we need to know the partition function which is just the sum over

499
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,850
of the of the states of the product with that

500
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,430
and by dividing by the partition function we cannot guarantee that the sum

501
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,870
the partition function of course looks very innocent but it's really you know at the

502
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,260
core of everything we can to try to do

503
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,580
if the partition function was easy to handle life would be good since it's not

504
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,950
easy to handle we're going to need to be smart about dealing with itself

505
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,790
we'll be hearing a lot more about it

506
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:08,310
another thing to notice here is that this representation is simple but it doesn't scale

507
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:12,240
because you need them make the size of the potential is exponential

508
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,950
in the number of variables in

509
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,140
so if i want to talk about dependencies among all other variables this doesn't work

510
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,350
very well

511
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:22,700
but they can be something else which is you know which is an equivalent forms

512
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,970
that of log the model instead of the products of factors i have an exponentiated

513
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,140
sum of weights features

514
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,570
and it's easy to see that can convert one from other just by having a

515
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,240
feature forty five

516
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,310
defining each possible state of the of the clique and having to wait that's the

517
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,490
log of the value of the potential

518
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,740
right so i can convert from i can convert from that from to this form

519
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,160
for example

520
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,680
if i find a feature that's one if you don't smoke or have consistency why

521
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:55,120
and give that feature weight of points fifty one

522
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,160
then this represents the same as the previous models

523
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,490
but it does so more compact

524
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,640
in this case i only see know went from four states to one feature but

525
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,580
imagine having an no clique with ten variables into the ten states

526
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,060
as long as i know that a small number of features that the relevant ones

527
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,890
i can just find the model compactly using those features

528
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:19,220
and you know we're going to be making good use of the

529
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,140
all right so

530
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,390
we would like to have a probabilistic knowledge bases

531
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:28,510
knowledge bases with the the formulas that we stated that no longer just true or

532
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,310
false but have probability

533
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,200
this is a long-standing question goes back to the nineteenth century

534
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,680
in a i it started that you know

535
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,410
at least in the eighties with the

536
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,970
nelson's work

537
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,240
so let's think about how we do this right the simplest way

538
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,510
to have a probabilistic knowledge base on the face of it

539
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,160
it's just to assign probabilities to find

540
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:58,010
instead of saying that you know smoking causes cancer i would say that with probability

541
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,580
point eight smoking causes cancer

542
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,580
this is a very natural thing to do

543
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,410
but you immediately run into a very big problem

544
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:09,680
the problem is that if i just stated bunch of formulas and their probabilities they

545
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,080
may not be consistent

546
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,640
i cannot for example so that the probability of a point eight and the probability

547
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,390
of a and b is point nine the probability of india has to be smaller

548
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,700
the probability of

549
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,390
so the first thing you have to do

550
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,470
is checked

551
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,450
that the formalism the probabilities that consists

552
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,930
and there are algorithms for doing this but unfortunately very you know this is an

553
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,100
intractable problem

554
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,990
let's suppose that you know you had somehow guarantee that all the funds consistent

555
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:44,540
hello everybody now unpublished opinion from the university of sheffield and i will try to

556
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:49,840
introduce you to the semantic web technologies for capturing sharing and

557
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,350
reusing knowledge

558
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:57,200
well the focus for a moment on to something that is called the knowledge lifecycle

559
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:04,150
this is because it's quite an important in my view to understand where we are

560
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:11,440
now start from the top we have discussed about knowledge acquisition of modelling basically building

561
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,610
ontologies the following step one the ontology will give you the definition of the domain

562
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,230
of task or whatever

563
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:26,910
the following steps to capture knowledge so that you can actually have instances of those

564
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:31,890
apologies for example and then when you have done it finally your

565
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,640
instances you might want to do something with those instances so for example in

566
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:42,350
to be industrial scenario you want to share it with our colleagues in one two

567
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,690
to enable the use of the knowledge

568
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,110
why do you want to manage knowledge

569
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,430
basically because you want to

570
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,210
enable use by people

571
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,740
it's not just the genetic uses typically timely and effective

572
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,760
so in order to do that you need to be able to share

573
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,220
in order to show

574
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,630
you need to capture

575
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,660
you see

576
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,930
if you go back to this

577
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,660
the scenario

578
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,110
actually defined goals

579
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,160
three years

580
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,190
and you have to go to be sure that you are able to go backwards

581
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,650
on this cycle

582
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:23,180
and at every step you provide the right solution so what i will talk about

583
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,320
is about

584
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,190
how to capture information

585
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,680
and i want to share it

586
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,100
to enable the years

587
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,930
this should have been this way

588
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:39,350
so this is what i was talking about so let's talk about knowledge capture

589
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,730
knowledge knowledge capture means collecting and creating knowledge within and across media archives this is

590
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:53,180
our interpretation you want to capture knowledge in reach semantically oriented way

591
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,530
and you have basically two task one is

592
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,680
you want to

593
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,110
annotate whatever is already structured

594
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:04,780
can be you want to have ontologies and you want to merge with

595
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:11,140
your ontologies or you want to create ontology using other ontologies more often

596
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:15,610
what you have you have databases and you want to use the database schema to

597
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:22,530
map to your ontology and create ontologies is here to instances coming from your database

598
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,490
so that it is compatible with your ontology we have seen more or less before

599
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,950
so i'm not going to talk about that but then you have

600
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,370
an awful lot of structured documents you have

601
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:40,770
a lot of knowledge that these in three texts and images is dating videos and

602
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,550
what you want to do you want to

603
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,560
you want to capture it

604
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,310
you want to make it available in form of

605
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,900
the way in a structured way you prefer

606
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:56,020
three instances into the ontology and this is exactly what i was talking about

607
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,280
again there are two moments in which you want to capture knowledge one is when

608
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,300
knowledge is generated

609
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:09,300
and the other one is on legacy documents take into account if you talk about

610
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:14,490
the average company you will see that in nineteen ninety five percent of the knowledge

611
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,110
is in unstructured documents so

612
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,150
a source

613
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,900
i mean so you can create methods you can use methods to

614
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,830
capture the information directly

615
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,860
in a structured way and possibly in an ontology oriented way

616
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:35,650
the on the legacy documents while there is much you can do is talk about

617
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:41,900
a very large scale sometimes let along the way you talk about the average large

618
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,430
enterprise you will discover that you may have several hundreds of thousands of documents and

619
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,560
you can have

620
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:55,060
probably millions of documents in a in some cases even opinions documents so we're talking

621
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:59,870
of large scale and what you want to get as outcome of the catch is

622
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:04,630
that the semantic representation of part of the content of the content is relevant to

623
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,610
your ontology or to your task

624
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:14,280
the first thing to say about documents is that is

625
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,370
the impression is quite common

626
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,640
data documents means stacks

627
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,630
had appeared text document does not mean

628
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,040
p text that text true

629
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,430
you can i would

630
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,410
you can have accept

631
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,970
a word and especially word also says

632
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:39,670
and powerpoint presentations and PDF documents are not text they tend to become documents contain

633
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:45,400
images and text the average web page is not just text so there is the

634
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,250
text that is the image

635
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,190
there can be video can be rolled eighty five measurements for example

636
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,220
and most of all you have media

637
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:58,970
that means that if you look at this powerpoint presentation of that image that is

638
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:03,380
that it's not very easy to see some faint that's description of something that is

639
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:08,590
in current interiors of car well the interiors of

640
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,630
description says a lot of things the textual description it doesn't tell you

641
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,720
the color of the searing searing with for example it doesn't tell you what kind

642
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,260
of instruments they are you can see by yourself in the image

643
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:25,050
so if you just consider the image you don't have a clue what it is

644
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:30,430
that you don't know what color easy to know what a wider images presented

645
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,610
and so on and so on but if you just read the text you miss

646
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,050
a lot of information we need to do to go cross media to understand

647
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,540
the picture the following the before

648
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,430
now how do you do was it was mentioned before but are typically what do

649
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:55,010
do you do ontology based annotation that means when you have an ontology you have

650
00:38:55,010 --> 00:39:01,590
structural or unstructured data sources like a web page in this case when you try

651
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:06,760
to do you try to associate part portions of the page or the document

652
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:14,110
ontology by saying these are instances of those ontology for those concepts so in this

653
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,090
case you see there is an image

654
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,540
this shows the shock

655
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,280
humes is what they sell

656
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:25,890
and what they sell are animals in particular on the enhances overpriced

657
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:28,560
now if you just look at the heart of the web page there is an

658
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,990
awful lot of more information more or less meaningful more or less useful but what

659
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,000
you want to do you want to do

660
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:40,930
take your ontology that represents your task the things are interested in you want to

661
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,430
associated information so you can ask questions like

662
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,510
who says

663
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,160
and was surprised

664
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,570
none of these

665
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,780
one of the worst user are actually using in the page they can three this

666
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,840
page you can actually retrieve more than that you can say why

667
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:05,330
this this company says how successful six pounds so you just keep the data then

668
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,300
the the page clean input what you have is

669
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,940
or statistics

670
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,710
and this is an album by

671
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:21,270
several are all very famous people

672
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,590
and long

673
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:42,820
because i only meant to be in are in t

674
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,800
the press as well so i'm getting close to all the authors this is somewhat

675
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,750
all result but at the time was

676
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,750
a major breakthrough and still is an amazing

677
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,360
on august is

678
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,020
professor here should not from the are RSA

679
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,610
when i took my phd comprehensive what some time ago on the cover she was

680
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,000
the joke question

681
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,690
which as of the authors of the the worst case linear time order statistics

682
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,770
which of them is the most rich

683
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:21,470
was certainly was not greater part of the comprehensive it's have but it was an

684
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:27,150
amazing question i want answered here because we're on take the perhaps think about it

685
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,380
and maybe not

686
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,820
obvious but several them are rich this is the question was the most rich

687
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:39,960
anyway before they're rich they came up with the cell growth

688
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,110
come up with many of sense even after getting rich

689
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,730
but not so

690
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,690
what we want is a good pivot

691
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,960
guaranteed good so wrapped around the world is going to be really good and so

692
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,000
the simple suckers just pick a random pair that it's going to go with high

693
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:01,190
we want to force the good pivot

694
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:04,170
and the

695
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:08,210
the new idea here is we're generated recursively

696
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:12,050
what else could we do

697
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,090
recurse now

698
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:17,900
you should know from the recurrence is that if we did two recursive calls on

699
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,980
problems of half the size we're going to get and we have a linear extra

700
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:27,270
work that's the merger events two times one or two pos ordering should recite in

701
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,170
your sleep

702
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,590
that's and log again

703
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,070
so we can recurse on two problems of half the size we got to do

704
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,610
better somehow these recursions

705
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:41,210
i have to add up to strictly less than n

706
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,860
that's the magic

707
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,400
the cell

708
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:52,210
so this is just consulate the random select and it really depends on the right

709
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:55,360
but all focus on the i th element one slide

710
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,820
and the size of the array

711
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,280
we want to select an

712
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,690
and i'm going to write this algorithm slightly less formally

713
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:09,420
than random selection because it's a bit higher level of an algorithm

714
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:30,980
and i mean draw

715
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,610
over here

716
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,920
the picture

717
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,980
the algorithm so

718
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,360
the first sort of the weirdest and is the key idea

719
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,710
one of the key ideas you take the elements and there are no particular order

720
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,550
so instead drawing them online

721
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,480
i'm going to draw the

722
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,170
in a five lyon over five grid one

723
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:59,780
it unfortunate takes one to one draw

724
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,920
but it

725
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,820
will take you weekly long alongside

726
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,460
my time

727
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,860
it doesn't really matter with the with this but it should be

728
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,550
the result it should be with over five symmetry right figure accordingly

729
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:19,050
with the number five at the height should be exactly five

730
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:23,380
right i can count that i was five

731
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,190
and this should be well you know our number may not be divisible by five

732
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,170
so maybe

733
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:30,860
it ends up in sort of an odd way

734
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,280
but what i'd like is that these chunks should be florida over five

735
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,650
and then we'll have at most four elements left over time can ignore those that

736
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,880
really matters just a constant additive constant

737
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,150
so here are my here's my RFA i just happened to

738
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:46,960
right in this funny way

739
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,460
and i should say this is actually even not that different from what people do

740
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,210
in practice maybe happened during practice for a a long time to get the data

741
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:57,780
is only about the model is going to gain

742
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:02,320
but the interesting thing is you can prove that so you initialise this whole process

743
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:07,230
with the apprenticeship learning idea of learning from expert human pilot demonstration that you don't

744
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,290
even need to explore this none of this aggressive driving your helicopter the age of

745
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,070
the flight on the thing

746
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,900
and we can prove is that given a on

747
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:23,010
the number of examples from the demonstrator with a small number of iterations the algorithm

748
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:27,970
with high probability of converge to policy whose performance is nearly as good as the

749
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:32,980
human demonstrating that science so there's actually we can guarantee that he you can guarantee

750
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:36,860
because we comparing was saying we do as well as the human demonstrating the task

751
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,830
was egypt says will have you globally optimal performance on on the other hand it

752
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:47,500
means that we can do this without ever needing to explicitly it explicitly explore all

753
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:52,470
is actually an impact as we really need to do this more than two iterations

754
00:45:52,480 --> 00:46:00,880
all quantities of interest member states what defines what is in the discrete states

755
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,900
action cases polynomial number states and actions in continuous state space case if you see

756
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,730
the model can be fit well using linear function approximation is polynomial in the dimension

757
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,240
of the state space

758
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:17,630
on there under certain assumptions that that that you know that linear regression with nominal

759
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,520
features small dynamics

760
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:23,140
this policy dimensional physics

761
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:28,690
so this is actually the way we file called film large number of helicopters launched

762
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:35,660
configurations and we pretty much only ever exploit to really explore the space

763
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:37,950
i guess you see

764
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:41,890
the action chris how many of you have seen you know one of helicopter videos

765
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:47,040
OK i was on this show different one

766
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:49,900
i'm gonna show different one that's where

767
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:54,730
oops that should a different video was the harder to see what's going on but

768
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,190
but is this is one that many of you probably won't have seen before

769
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:03,090
so call this issue two i guess that this is another

770
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,380
let's call the chaos over

771
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:17,230
i don't know how to to describe it other than to say there's a helicopter

772
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:22,300
rotating simultaneously on two axes the first time i saw it i actually had no

773
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,140
idea it was going on

774
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:26,960
well was

775
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:32,630
i know is is yes i i think it's good performance

776
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:36,800
actually to find the others

777
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:49,200
since i think

778
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:52,900
i think we'll see how pretty see what we call show ones

779
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:59,260
you know i don't think to have

780
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:05,450
what the hell

781
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:13,390
so i to i so and i should say really many people that worked on

782
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:18,500
autonomous helicopters most notably every runs where MIT and georgia tech

783
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,970
on you know

784
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:25,370
a period of many years were highly motivated to build the best possible time somehow

785
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,810
control because

786
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:31,680
and genuinely the only way within able to do so far is using human demonstrations

787
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,970
and forced

788
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:38,500
try lots of things before that

789
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,860
the first

790
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:53,970
second at the topic does it away which is to foster

791
00:48:54,150 --> 00:49:03,090
pass horizontal circle

792
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:20,840
sixty roles in stage three clips is that those are so the whole this is

793
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:24,160
no this is smaller c helicopter

794
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:40,790
well i see yes

795
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,830
so we're fortunate to have won the best spies and

796
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,110
in the united states work with us and so he was able to demonstrate his

797
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:51,540
manoeuvres on the procedures so we actually know these manoeuvres better than he does because

798
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:55,300
of the details of the other but we don't have rough demonstration

799
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:58,940
so i think this article was a huge part and as it turns out that

800
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:04,170
when you're watching these videos from afar always when you actually there seem helicopter life

801
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,140
from afar

802
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,920
it turns out to be difficult to tell if a small helicopter which is this

803
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:14,050
one his last full-size helicopter people inside so what happens is very often is on

804
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:17,890
people see this in the common one

805
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:24,470
the helicopter crashing so that they show up on

806
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,930
this is about what is about to speak maybe you can hold in one hand

807
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:31,150
so from data to tell me about this space

808
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:37,270
it's the idea not for this wonderful one of the helicopters that relate the tip

809
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:39,300
of the role to play on

810
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:43,280
news and about one-third of the speed of sound so this big enough to be

811
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,480
dangerous enough to kill people

812
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:54,340
so the when thing did the pension learning is in some sense thinking along because

813
00:50:54,470 --> 00:51:01,190
if you think about how human flies of human humankind flies helicopters i think that

814
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,460
if you or i were to

815
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:06,790
you know i tried to find these things with no one teaching also showing us

816
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:10,680
anything i know i know i don't have the hope of ever learning to find

817
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:14,910
these things if i were sort of saying all you know in grassy by myself

818
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:15,460
they have today

819
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:19,290
and i think the only way that human pilots is there to do these things

820
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,240
is because

821
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:23,060
of the knowledge that you know that you the

822
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:26,800
human society was society helicopter pilots required over of

823
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:33,780
years decades and if humans are these things about human demonstration i think this may

824
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,860
be extinct even maybe is

825
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,820
over the challenge is to expect of reinforcement learning how others do so without the

826
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,420
demonstration so that's why

827
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,360
i think are all and i was surprised by this one was out to recommend

828
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:51,130
its problems i wasn't expecting demonstrations it is important that given that humans really need

829
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:54,510
the demonstration themselves are going to do these things i think it's actually very nice

830
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:59,270
easy also a promising way to think about how to teach i want things to

831
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,110
there's a lot

832
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:08,110
there out how is one person you are so you know each of those maneuvers

833
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:12,400
was i i would guess taken up by one human and for one human to

834
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,880
discover all these maneuvers you know

835
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:16,300
this sort of

836
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,360
first elected so

837
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:22,450
become more clear there was no way to formalize what the problem is the next

838
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:29,470
question is how do we solve it and more importantly how do we efficiently solving

839
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,730
OK so i'm going to ask if you have any questions at all please and

840
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:36,530
after this lecture it often happen all the someone early on the thing and only

841
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:38,220
person this question one as

842
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:43,380
and that's not that that's not what lecture is not worth anything to so

843
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:47,600
please ask questions if you have the question one out there

844
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:50,980
also i have carefully hidden areas of my slides

845
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,360
OK it is your job to find them

846
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,870
so if you see something it doesn't make sense

847
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:01,520
i could be wrong and for the students classes that quite often

848
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,430
OK so let's let's let's think of some difference

849
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:06,480
areas where we can plan

850
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:11,160
in ways that might affect the world so in

851
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:15,990
don't be a whole range of of examples here so one kind of boring but

852
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:18,490
still interesting problem is only control

853
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:19,910
OK you got

854
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,860
eighty four the building that bangor six elevators ten elevators

855
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:27,390
people coming in every floor you don't know exactly how to come in you my

856
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:32,050
know distribution of how they arrived you've got people in elevators

857
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,850
OK how how you plan optimally

858
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,240
how do you know that the undulator later should go to the middle floor and

859
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:41,730
wait for someone to push the but OK or or or perhaps is not small

860
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:45,050
but how how you do it is clearly very difficult problem

861
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,840
OK and think about just the action space you have many actions you can take

862
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:53,270
any given time step if you had just six elevators until we can go

863
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,210
up down or stay in the same flawed

864
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,440
OK you got three six actions

865
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:03,370
as a huge axes space what you had ten elevators twenty elevators you can reasonably

866
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:07,220
exports entire joint action space you have to exploit some structure and that if you

867
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,440
want to be efficient

868
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,580
we'll talk about today

869
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:19,520
dynamics here you might have seen the people i randomly is important for the model

870
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:24,530
what's your objective an elevator control consoles can someone suggested that your objective what you

871
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:29,620
might want to optimize

872
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,810
right OK so there might be

873
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,330
average waiting time because you've got lot of people or other

874
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:41,060
or OK that's so i average waiting time will be one

875
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,100
but what if

876
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,740
what if i want to ensure that no one waits for some period of time

877
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,810
take the maximum waiting times and minimize that

878
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,130
it's not clear what the objective should be

879
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:56,290
certainly i know i think in

880
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,580
japan actually have walls and you can't wait any more than this amount an elevator

881
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,640
so when the the buildings they have to

882
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:07,490
and sure enough elevators two two two

883
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,240
sounds like a lot

884
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,940
now if we can be more intelligent in his fewer elevators and be more intelligent

885
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:19,190
about how you schedule this and you save money

886
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:24,540
it is interesting here you have a very practical future rival you get acting nothing

887
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,200
will happen in in the future

888
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:32,180
OK now you have certain constraints if you're elevator you is for neuron the six

889
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:34,570
years florence and suddenly start going down again

890
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,670
going up this so these are going to be really annoyed

891
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,640
back at eighty five minutes to get to your destination why we in the later

892
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,850
never to make progress really upset so you might have constraints on with set solutions

893
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:51,720
allows well for example you not reverse direction if someone's going to current direction

894
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:52,560
and in in

895
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,380
unison bends inside

896
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:59,730
so there with this boring application but it's still a very hard problem in one

897
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,470
thing so they can make a lot of money

898
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:08,440
OK now is more interesting games actually i have spent their time playing games and

899
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:14,070
that's what find is really cool year it has to teach itself to play

900
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:17,030
and if you look at a fellow

901
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,490
the best seller player exactly that it played itself learned

902
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:25,820
how to beat itself and i got better OK and and and the best fellow

903
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,120
players now

904
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:30,020
are much better than any human

905
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:34,710
come out to be the winner and when the system follows my will

906
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:36,070
and i'm going to

907
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,190
take the

908
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:38,700
the second derivative

909
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:41,370
so i get mine is omega squid

910
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,520
j omega comes out twice

911
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:45,770
so i get is omega squared

912
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,600
then they get close gamma

913
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,270
times j omega

914
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:51,760
then i get plus

915
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:53,570
omega zero squared

916
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,580
and the whole thing

917
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:59,960
multiplied by a two to power e g

918
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:02,560
omega t minus delta

919
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,350
that now equals

920
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:05,600
f is zero

921
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:09,210
divided by and times e could power j

922
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:13,340
omega three to the whole thing is now in the complex plane

923
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,340
and you see that it europarl apology omega t

924
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,090
cancels on both sides

925
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:23,730
so i lose i lose my cool apology omega t and i go to multiply

926
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:27,690
both sides by two apology personnel delta

927
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,030
so i lose my

928
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,820
delta here but it appears that here

929
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:34,040
so if i make that simple

930
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,410
change algebraic change

931
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:37,950
we're going to get minus

932
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,020
omega square

933
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,230
let's go my

934
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:44,840
was omega

935
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:46,950
zero square

936
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,510
multiplied by eight

937
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,710
must now be equal

938
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:56,570
zero divided by and thanks to the power j delta

939
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:58,540
oh my god he's got

940
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:03,020
and i moved the delta to the right side

941
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,200
we live that

942
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:06,870
and this

943
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,760
i can be written

944
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,280
zero divided by n

945
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:13,440
times the cosine of delta

946
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:18,700
postage j times the site of delta i'm still in the complex plane but that's

947
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,710
now let's compare the apples

948
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:28,880
was apples and oranges with oranges

949
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:30,850
this is an apple

950
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:34,470
and this is an apple that means it's real

951
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:38,250
that means that this is an apple

952
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:40,290
but they also oranges

953
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:42,950
this is an audience has j

954
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,500
and this is an orange

955
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:45,710
it has the j

956
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,640
and so for this equation

957
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:51,930
two always hold at all moments in time

958
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:53,410
the apples

959
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:54,640
must be

960
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:58,390
equal to the apples on this site and the oranges on this site must be

961
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,680
equal to the oranges on that site

962
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:03,690
so it looks like one equation but it really is

963
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,270
two equations

964
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:08,790
so we now get

965
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:12,580
that mine is omega squared

966
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,840
plus omega zero square

967
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,650
times a

968
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:22,910
must be equal to have zero divided by n

969
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,770
times the cosine of self

970
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,430
on both sides are equal

971
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,680
and now we get the oranges on both sides omega

972
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,350
must be equal

973
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,590
times a

974
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:42,580
i still have this a year

975
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,190
the game omega times age

976
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,810
divided by m

977
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:53,960
times the side of the altar

978
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:59,340
two equations with two unknowns any as unknown and delta as unknown

979
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:01,300
and easy to solve

980
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:03,710
if you square the

981
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:07,540
then you get signed squared delta cosine square they'll will tell you at the moment

982
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:09,420
that's one

983
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:11,820
so that immediately gives you then

984
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:13,200
what is

985
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,830
so a

986
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,450
it's going to be have zero

987
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:21,410
divided by an upstairs

988
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:22,650
and downstairs

989
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:27,460
we're going to get omega zero squared

990
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,100
miners omega square squared

991
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,690
omega gamma

992
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,960
this is the amplitude

993
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,080
of the object

994
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:45,120
will size that will talk about this would lease the next ten minutes is very

995
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,330
complicated function

996
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:52,420
we want to see through the equation what that actually means

997
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,050
and the tensions of delta

998
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:58,830
it is easy to find because you define this equation by that once you get

999
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:02,030
immediately the tendons of delta h disappear

1000
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:04,320
and have zero over and disappear

1001
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,940
so you get the tangent

1002
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,830
of the angle delta

1003
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,330
omega gamma

1004
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,450
divided by

1005
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:13,420
omega zero squared

1006
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:18,480
miners omega script

1007
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:22,230
we can now return to the real world

1008
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,530
and if we return to the real world we have to change x

1009
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:28,080
as he back into x

1010
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:30,340
and so our final solution

1011
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:32,990
which i will put in color

1012
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,290
well then beta x

1013
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:37,000
as a function of t

1014
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,070
is this amplitude a

1015
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:40,730
times the cosine

1016
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:41,960
of omega t

1017
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:44,180
minus delta

1018
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,860
that is the omega

1019
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:54,620
it's my will that i impose on the system

1020
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,480
that there are are no

1021
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,030
adjustable constants

1022
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,450
which were so used to in the past

1023
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,180
in the past we said well you can start the system at equal zero you

1024
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,130
can define the position

1025
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:14,180
you can give it a certain velocity so you always expects that a new solution

1026
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:15,110
there are two

1027
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:17,710
in order to

1028
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:22,780
all these statements only making it only about let's say the shapes of primitive forms

1029
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:27,770
of the of this properties right so but you would want something more because it's

1030
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:32,030
not really clear how this how this property interact with each other right so the

1031
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:37,170
next question we ask is how should sent the parameters psychology be said the initial

1032
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:41,840
chain of three nodes are how should we said our image initiated so that we

1033
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,600
can either mark match with all of the properties of the real

1034
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:47,950
and so so this is the the

1035
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:50,400
right we have

1036
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:55,570
some real network somebody gives us our goal is to generate the synthetic network and

1037
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:59,860
once we have this graph we would like to compare since it's

1038
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:03,840
non non non trivial to compare graphs what we do is we take both of

1039
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:09,610
and calculate some statistics and compare those statistics for example what we can do is

1040
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:15,000
calculate the degree distribution this network degree distribution that networks and block them and if

1041
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,610
they if they overlay

1042
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:20,050
that that's that's OK so this is this is the goal

1043
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,610
and what they showed so far is

1044
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:26,880
we discuss briefly what are the properties like what should be measure

1045
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:30,610
then what is a good model i should i just showed you kronecker another question

1046
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:33,050
is how can we find the parameters of the model

1047
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:39,240
the idea will be using is very simple so we've be doing maximum likelihood estimation

1048
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,640
so somebody will give us the real graph

1049
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:42,810
and the idea is

1050
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:44,560
let's find these

1051
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:49,500
the this matrix three by three or four by four that maximize the

1052
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:52,360
likelihood of generating the graph

1053
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:53,630
we have

1054
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:59,060
in reality we won't really work with like zero one matrix but we have be

1055
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:04,260
what like probabilistic equivalent of some instead of having zero and once with zero means

1056
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,510
an absence of an edge in one presents in the presence of an edge we

1057
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:13,550
will now have have probabilities gives every cell we have a probability of an edge

1058
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:14,500
between them

1059
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:17,160
and then the same machinery applies

1060
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:21,180
and the idea is let's search over this matrices

1061
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,080
to maximize this likelihood

1062
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,770
and if you do this mainly

1063
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:29,310
it will take like and victoria and square at time

1064
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,970
and why is that

1065
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:38,200
the then victorian effect comes from basic testing ground for graph isomorphism right we have

1066
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:43,040
to consider all possible orderings of the nodes and if we play

1067
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:45,320
and since we plan to fit this model sun

1068
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:49,050
graphs of ten thousand twenty thousand fifty thousand nodes

1069
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,420
this is be

1070
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:53,910
much too expensive so that they can used here is

1071
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,970
two two of what is called a super exponential complexity is basically by using

1072
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:04,910
metropolis sampling and is basically users like constant time we to be constant

1073
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,620
and then

1074
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:10,220
the the in square and that comes from basic the fact that we have to

1075
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:14,340
evaluate every cell of graph adjacency matrix if have to compare how many edges are

1076
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:17,600
shared so we have to go and check every possible

1077
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:22,230
and this is what one can do is one can exploit the property the properties

1078
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:25,840
of kronecker graphs and the fact that real graphs are sparse what i mean by

1079
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,500
this by sparse is that the number of edges in the

1080
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,630
in the network is much smaller

1081
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:34,630
and in the end square which is like the size of the adjacency matrix so

1082
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,360
this would give us a linear effect so

1083
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:41,480
what is the bottom line is that we can find the parameters of the kronecker

1084
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,610
graph in linear time so the time proportional to the number of edges

1085
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:51,520
i just show an experiment on the graph of sixty six thousand nodes and twenty

1086
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:57,020
six thousand edges so finding the parameters takes less than twenty minutes

1087
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,880
and if you go and compared the properties of the

1088
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,380
through so the

1089
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:06,710
circles and synthetic equivalent because you

1090
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:10,750
the measure the man of the match the properties were so here is the degree

1091
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:15,480
distribution so this is basically the distribution over the number of links and node has

1092
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:19,420
and here we have a distribution over the that's in the network so basically says

1093
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:24,360
that they are omitted in both cases around four of the real graph and the

1094
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:30,060
and then we can do the same for spectral properties of the of the two

1095
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:32,840
graphs of two adjacency matrices and again

1096
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:37,840
we seem to be underestimated the components of the eigen values so here i blocking

1097
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,400
logrank which is the log i can value

1098
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:45,880
on the other but i'm putting blogrank which is the the log first i connected

1099
01:06:45,890 --> 01:06:49,120
components of the first arguement and again the sort of match

1100
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,540
concludes the first part of

1101
01:06:54,580 --> 01:07:00,100
completed work when we looked at what is what how can we model of network

1102
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,350
evolution and now i would like to study the second but if there are any

1103
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:09,130
i could think about that for

1104
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,000
so i so

1105
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:19,240
in all experiments using the notion of effective diameter which means the distance within reach

1106
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,810
ninety percent of

1107
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:24,340
that's of nodes can be reached and the reason why we are using this is

1108
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:29,820
for example i mean i wish o one one one example of of

1109
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:32,190
before they of diameter of

1110
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:37,390
coming microsoft messenger communication network cracking data is out there on the model of the

1111
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:41,040
distribution is at seven and like ninety percent of reachable pairs

1112
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:44,320
nineteen ninety percent of the people can be reached within a cops

1113
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:48,420
but you call you can also find that sort like twenty thirty

1114
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:51,440
hope so and so

1115
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:55,290
do we basically just one person it so that we are less prone to

1116
01:07:55,330 --> 01:08:00,430
that's the reason that's what

1117
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:10,520
i like those

1118
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,530
it is

1119
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:13,870
what happens is

1120
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:17,580
OK this will be but still i would i mean i can take it off

1121
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:22,310
line but the idea is that usually we can like densely connected part so usually

1122
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:25,400
one one of the so we have this two by two matrix

1123
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:28,680
i don't know

1124
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:32,520
right and what usually happens is that here is something like point nine here is

1125
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:37,520
small this is for the autonomous systems and here here is that i know something

1126
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,900
like point four or something and here would be like point three something like that

1127
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:46,950
so you you get this densely connected but this this result in graph where you

1128
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:50,520
almost have included between the core of the of the network and then you have

1129
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,690
the rest sort of attaching

1130
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:57,320
and then this basically this to measure how much how much does go from here

1131
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,650
to to here and the other way around

1132
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:01,340
OK but how

1133
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,370
i can explain what later so

1134
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:07,170
let let me continue with the second part

1135
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:10,370
and now

1136
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,480
what i what what i want to talk about this

1137
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:17,890
about the processes taking place on the networks and what we look at look at

1138
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:22,630
here what we call cascades which are basically the propagation graphs and i defined them

1139
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:26,660
a bit later and first we saw some properties of the lens of a simple

1140
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:30,140
model and in some way how to explain this

1141
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,060
OK so here he is

1142
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:35,000
skip prezzo cascades were first studied by

1143
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:39,750
in social sciences but and they define it as the phenomena where the idea of

1144
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:44,270
some action becomes wide widely adopted by the influence of the so let's say this

1145
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:46,730
is out this is our social networks

1146
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:50,540
and this is the first person who i know buys a new product or something

1147
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:51,510
and then that is

1148
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,760
their friends

1149
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:56,480
some of their friends will will due to these recommendations

1150
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:01,980
i will also go by the product may make recommendations for what now this note

1151
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,690
as he got two recommendations decided to buy

1152
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:05,810
he recommended on

1153
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:10,060
four and so on right and now this process it's like propagates over the network

1154
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:11,740
given this

1155
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:14,830
cascade is just the graph that is induced by these

1156
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:17,700
processes that spreads over the network OK

1157
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,890
and more specifically what we look at

1158
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:23,650
this is a good

1159
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:25,860
so that is an easy test

1160
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,010
which sometimes

1161
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:30,450
comes in handy

1162
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:35,680
so now comes the question is a high-voltage always dangerous

1163
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:37,850
namely putting my hands

1164
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,860
nothing and right finger

1165
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:42,940
the outlet is danger is always dangerous

1166
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,370
high falls

1167
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:46,510
well it often is

1168
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,340
but i will show you today that i can generate

1169
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,230
these are really thirty thousand volts

1170
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:53,610
but it

1171
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:57,310
and survive

1172
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,770
if you call your hair in the winter

1173
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:04,450
maybe not today but if you comment in the winter hair is dry nicely washed

1174
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:11,060
the difference between the column in your hair could easily be thirty thousand four

1175
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:13,600
and this voltage is so high

1176
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:16,400
that's box can fly over

1177
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,520
you hair

1178
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,370
the com

1179
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,690
it's like a spark plugs in the car

1180
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:27,480
in a way it's like lightning

1181
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,600
what is the current will flow through the air

1182
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:32,060
three my hair

1183
01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:33,800
and the co

1184
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:39,700
but there is so little electricity solar electric charge my head on the court

1185
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:44,310
that the current will flow is not high enough the doesn't last long enough

1186
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,770
to kill so it's completely innocent

1187
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:47,680
even though

1188
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:49,900
it is thirty thousand four

1189
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:53,870
but the thirty thousand fold collapses to nothing the moment that

1190
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:57,050
as part flights

1191
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:58,810
raise your comb your hair

1192
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:01,280
you may also use some cracking

1193
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,660
and in fact when i was combing my hair early on with this experiment i

1194
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,970
did hear some cracking with feel good

1195
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,560
because that means

1196
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:11,480
areas reasonably dry

1197
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,550
you may use some crack because these parts that fly that you may not have

1198
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:18,860
make some sound

1199
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:21,400
and in fact if you do this in the winter and i would advise you

1200
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,980
to do that

1201
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:25,560
not all the lights off in the room make sure start

1202
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,910
going from the familiar to make sure you have washed your hair that you hair

1203
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:29,660
is dry

1204
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:33,800
and you call your hair and you actually see sparks year them and you can

1205
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,810
even better

1206
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:38,900
i have done

1207
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:42,270
countless times when i was

1208
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,450
student pressure

1209
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:47,610
what i would do is i was going from the from there

1210
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:52,400
and i will and i sure you really should remain and should not

1211
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,410
and then in in front of the mirror when everything is dark you take sure

1212
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:56,970
of very slow

1213
01:12:57,020 --> 01:13:02,520
and they've seen zillions small parks and you sure is glowing like like

1214
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:05,190
it's really a fantastic experience

1215
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:07,680
so i recommend all of you to do that

1216
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,300
wait until february

1217
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:12,030
and it's even more fun if you do it with a friend we should do

1218
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,980
i will

1219
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:20,940
of course needless to say i was planning to do it today

1220
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:24,190
but the humidity is too high so it

1221
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:25,560
so you have to wait

1222
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:30,010
until the area is really very dry and that's no joke makes a huge difference

1223
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:31,510
how long the charge

1224
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:33,550
can be kept and humidity

1225
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,550
it's just

1226
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,850
there's too low a

1227
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:44,060
is the poor very poor insulator and so did the charge this leads off u

1228
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:48,550
perhaps you remember when you sit in your car and you move on the seat

1229
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:51,140
or when you scuff few feet

1230
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:53,480
and then you touch the doorknob

1231
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,900
you have sparked draws support

1232
01:13:55,900 --> 01:14:00,440
does it kill you know is unpleasant can be unpleasant you may get a small

1233
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:02,940
and the

1234
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:05,150
the difference in voltage between u

1235
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:08,450
and the doorknob could easily be thirty thousand four

1236
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:10,370
but the moment that you touch it

1237
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:14,530
it collapses nothing current is not high enough doesn't last long enough

1238
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:15,520
and so

1239
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:17,570
there's no danger for you

1240
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:18,480
you will

1241
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,980
just a little bit of a nuisance but that's all

1242
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:22,480
there was

1243
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,230
when i was beating

1244
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:28,760
but i was beating alex

1245
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:35,190
there was easily thirty thousand volts between him and probably more

1246
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:38,940
was still alive at least

1247
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:41,010
i am

1248
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:43,160
by duality

1249
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,530
it looks like he's also life

1250
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:47,580
now this phenomenon of part

1251
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,640
as in a we call the electrical breakdown

1252
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:52,400
so the higher the voltage

1253
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,690
and the sharper

1254
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:58,680
the objects are the easier it is for these sports development so here is ideal

1255
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,950
because harris

1256
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:08,700
sticking out like like needles so it's ideal for electrical breakdown

1257
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:11,310
i have there in the corner

1258
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:15,690
spectacular battery which runs only on water

1259
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:18,390
and it can easily produce

1260
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,690
in the winter

1261
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:22,140
sixty thousand poles they

1262
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:24,060
maybe only twenty thousand

1263
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:26,300
o thirty thousand

1264
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:28,620
and before i demonstrate this

1265
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,990
i want you to understand

1266
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:33,300
how easy it is to build one

1267
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:35,080
because it is an ideal

1268
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:39,610
to do with health

1269
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:41,230
what you see here

1270
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:42,530
at the top

1271
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:45,860
a plastic bottle

1272
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:50,300
i just want to

1273
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:03,660
that will

1274
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,770
so this

1275
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:24,060
you might want to be

1276
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,020
one is

1277
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:41,510
c one

1278
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:48,770
if you really want to write

1279
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:54,250
division it

1280
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:00,580
the you re

1281
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:05,960
as much as

1282
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:20,470
the original edition

1283
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,720
need to

1284
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:48,020
the full

1285
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:02,430
it is quite strong

1286
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,850
so it

1287
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:10,200
so the

1288
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:18,270
is the rules that

1289
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:23,410
this is where the spirit

1290
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:32,220
in two thousand

1291
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:40,370
just so

1292
01:18:57,990 --> 01:19:01,140
is that

1293
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:18,760
once you

1294
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:24,580
with this is that

1295
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:30,450
so use

1296
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:32,870
you t

1297
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:52,330
so why is

1298
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:04,160
this is a list

1299
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:05,910
what we

1300
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:11,370
i think just

1301
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,200
there's no

1302
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,700
it is

1303
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,950
some of the

1304
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,390
we didn't really

1305
01:20:57,910 --> 01:21:01,350
this one

1306
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:25,160
so strong was born into a world where you will can

1307
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:41,290
the really wants to

1308
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:44,160
obviously these this

1309
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:51,790
this is c

1310
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:55,330
you yes

1311
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:57,240
it's always

1312
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:00,140
he was

1313
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:02,560
one of the things

1314
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:10,200
OK to use

1315
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:17,430
written in terms of

1316
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:20,540
so what is it

1317
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,890
the sea

1318
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,000
he is

1319
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,520
and here i have a square

1320
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:29,580
just how much memory and you start stable

1321
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,960
is this true as well

1322
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,560
les s

1323
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:41,540
and it is for this quantity and it is for this quantity one

1324
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,230
four large as you can see that it is

1325
01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:46,930
is going to be much larger

1326
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,520
four large as is going to be much like

1327
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:55,330
so we're saving on representation and you will see that we're facing competition

1328
01:22:55,350 --> 01:23:01,100
that square so now the answer to your question so basically what you have is

1329
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:07,710
that these factorizations is equivalent to other the opposite

1330
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:09,560
just use

1331
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:11,750
what to call

1332
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:13,250
the bayes rule

1333
01:23:13,310 --> 01:23:15,790
was from the base

1334
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:18,080
bayes rule

1335
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,250
tells you

1336
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:23,790
something that simple

1337
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:26,870
know that

1338
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:34,810
you know he's

1339
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:42,080
so this is equal to p of a given b

1340
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:43,910
p of the

1341
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:47,710
this is equal to p of the given a

1342
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:49,690
the of a

1343
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:52,540
so we have these equality

1344
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:55,270
is called

1345
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:05,890
just use bayes rule

1346
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:09,180
these quantities equal to this quantity

1347
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:13,060
replace this quantity

1348
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:16,180
that which is equal to this by this

1349
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:19,020
and then you get another form

1350
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,770
do this again you can another afford

1351
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:24,250
them saying basically is that

1352
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:28,560
a single conditional independence

1353
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:32,080
thing those violence there

1354
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,910
can be associated with this

1355
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,020
two different representation

1356
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,960
the trying to

1357
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:00,930
OK so

1358
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:05,190
you what you need to do it in you to write to conditional independent

1359
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:10,870
and see how can simplify them so as to obtain the more general type dependency

1360
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,350
for example

1361
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,270
give an example

1362
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,290
i have

1363
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:40,410
you can do and make

1364
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,350
i if you have

1365
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,600
x one is independent

1366
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,350
x two

1367
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:50,640
x three

1368
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:57,540
x one is independent of x three

1369
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,950
in the next

1370
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,100
let's assume that had

1371
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:10,500
now he is what can now is an exercise

1372
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:14,460
you can tell the x one is independent of x two

1373
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:21,750
you can tell the next one is independent of x

1374
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:24,890
this will fall from that

1375
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:28,270
and this as an exercise just write these expressions

1376
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:39,520
right expression and you figure out that both of these expressions correspond to the world

1377
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:42,310
well the map has already been done before

1378
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:45,660
several types and that's what i call properties in right

1379
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:50,870
when you have a lot of the properties of conditional independence

1380
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:52,230
so basically what

1381
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:57,350
the property is basically right this thing is for example used is equivalent

1382
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:59,100
so x two

1383
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:03,600
independent of x one given x three

1384
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:05,980
i just things equivalent to

1385
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,770
can opinion is two things

1386
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:11,390
well just do the math and that you can

1387
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:15,210
that's a property of conditional independence

1388
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:19,930
then you can write down as many properties which

1389
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:27,370
well that's how i wrote it

1390
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:28,520
i just

1391
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,290
i just saw the graphical model

1392
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:32,730
we'll see later

1393
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:39,780
continuous discrete optimization problems and the assignment variables for object i are not copied to

1394
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:45,960
the assignment variables for object j given the characteristics of fuel mixture coefficients and the

1395
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:53,650
so if you do that conditioning off on your on your statistics the modes and

1396
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:59,940
the mixing variables then the assignments of different objects are independent

1397
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,750
and that is expressed by placing basically the linearity

1398
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:08,630
here the linearity of CIA not being copied

1399
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:09,900
see i prime

1400
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:21,070
so tightly tishby has interpreted this scheme as is the bottleneck scheme is finding an

1401
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:27,480
efficient code for your feature vectors you have to find product to build codebook vectors

1402
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:30,130
x two and the

1403
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:36,050
cost function which i just have to presented on the previous ten c can be

1404
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:42,360
written as the difference between two mutual information and that's all of the nice interpretation

1405
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:45,440
in terms of in terms of

1406
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:51,250
and for information theoretic approach our image blocks are the axis here

1407
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:57,300
they are supposed to be compressed into segment descriptors these are the x two is

1408
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:03,150
here and what you want to preserve of is with these these segment descriptors you

1409
01:29:03,150 --> 01:29:08,340
want to preserve as much knowledge as possible about your features in the features might

1410
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:15,270
be the colors although the local frequencies so the wise encoded you're you're colours and

1411
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:21,270
local frequencies on local descriptors and you sort of compressed into context and that's the

1412
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:27,500
way it tally tishby cells these ideas you compress your image patches in the context

1413
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:30,020
sensitive way so that the

1414
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:37,050
reciting description of your image patches is maximally informative first perspective the colour content and

1415
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:43,780
the frequency content if you have selected why scholars for his

1416
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:52,550
here you have the same think pictorial describe this is the feature space

1417
01:29:52,570 --> 01:29:56,570
this is the object space and you compress it sort of in in a reduced

1418
01:29:56,570 --> 01:30:06,000
representation by fixing this constraint on the minimal amount of informativeness of your clusters whereas

1419
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,840
here you want to minimize the mutual information to get a generic descriptions of few

1420
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:14,590
objects basically of your of your image patches

1421
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:19,770
i think this is a very nice concept from the interpretation point of view on

1422
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:20,630
a vertex

1423
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:32,440
successfully surprisingly successful in in many different areas like document retrieval my first phd student

1424
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:38,900
thomas hofmann has applied in document retrieval is very good designers the hebrew group is

1425
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:47,250
using the concept for analyzing spike trains as well as galaxy information and they have

1426
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:53,820
similar applications in bioinformatics and we have used in in in vision and and also

1427
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:56,400
in some areas of land

1428
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:00,800
now the segmentation is PD looks like this

1429
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:05,610
here you have these image and basically on the on the basis of local colour

1430
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:08,550
descriptors these types of statements you get

1431
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:13,550
and so for many applications this is a good enough segmentation

1432
01:31:13,570 --> 01:31:19,380
we are currently participating in the competition set up by the money group they have

1433
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:26,730
a large number of hand labeled images and what you cannot do is you can

1434
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:33,230
basically use your favourite segmentation algorithm run it against the database and then do precision

1435
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:39,770
recall analysis of uris size compared to the ground truth which is defined by by

1436
01:31:39,770 --> 01:31:44,110
berkeley undergraduate students so if you believe that is a good source for ground crews

1437
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:48,840
then you can compare yourself against this database

1438
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:55,130
since it's fully probabilistic model you can do resampling so this is the original image

1439
01:31:55,130 --> 01:32:00,170
where we use which we used to train our segmentation model and this is sort

1440
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:05,170
of a sampling from that from that probabilistic model and you see it's the colour

1441
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:08,280
segmentation approach and obviously screwed up the texture

1442
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:12,610
and actually we could do that for texture as well but the the construction is

1443
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:17,900
much more complicated than you have got all features two to go from feature space

1444
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:20,940
back to the original space

1445
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:27,610
it's worked sufficiently well and that's actually what we paid for in remote sensing imagery

1446
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:31,800
so this was the original and this is the reason that image and for many

1447
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:34,840
in that area

1448
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,050
this was surprisingly good so they they

1449
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:40,800
they bought into the model

1450
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:42,820
mean outcome too

1451
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,300
are there any questions

1452
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:50,130
you need to get back that

1453
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:59,090
no that was not used now since the the the the local windows are overlapping

1454
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:06,610
you get you get an implicit coupling between different between different sites by feeding in

1455
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:08,840
the same statistics

1456
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:13,550
but what you really would like to know is if you for example

1457
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:19,440
we have a markov random field model in the back of your head and you

1458
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:27,150
had you had to your to your cost function for clustering local coupling of of

1459
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:35,610
the of the CIA value to a neighbouring CI plus one LCI minus one object

1460
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:39,360
then you would also have to have a smooth mapping

1461
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:42,480
but then what i'm saying is we don't really know

1462
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:47,530
the imperfections of the sphere there areas which have so big sharp points

1463
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:48,410
and so

1464
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:52,700
we will make it to one million volts we get a breakdown maybe add a

1465
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:56,910
few hundred thousand maybe three hundred thousand people

1466
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:59,540
you can also calculate what the maximum

1467
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,780
charges on the vendor graph

1468
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:05,580
because if the maximum potential three hundred thousand volts

1469
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:07,850
you know rate is is point three

1470
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:10,200
meters so you can calculate now

1471
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:11,780
what the maximum

1472
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:15,610
charges that you can put on the open graph using an equation

1473
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,590
give you can microkernel

1474
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:20,950
so the maximum potential for our underground

1475
01:34:20,990 --> 01:34:22,040
because of the order

1476
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:23,100
of three

1477
01:34:23,150 --> 01:34:24,540
hundred thousand thousand people

1478
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,730
gives you know feeling of qualitative

1479
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:28,260
feeling four numbers

1480
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,670
about the

1481
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:30,790
because is down

1482
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:36,760
so to give you an idea of what are when the graph can do and

1483
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:41,440
later we will understand how the charge get there you have some feeling of potential

1484
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:42,260
and four

1485
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:47,070
the charges that are involved

1486
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:48,950
here's my friend the graph

1487
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,260
and i approached then the graph

1488
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:52,460
with a

1489
01:34:52,530 --> 01:34:57,510
sphere which is connected to the earth and its positive charge on it

1490
01:34:57,530 --> 01:35:01,150
then this will become negatively charged through induction

1491
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:02,930
and so you get field lines

1492
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:04,990
we go from the vendor graph

1493
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,970
so these object always perpendicular

1494
01:35:08,010 --> 01:35:09,550
the equipotentials

1495
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,700
go like this

1496
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:12,710
and so

1497
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:14,340
electric field here

1498
01:35:14,410 --> 01:35:15,640
i will probably be

1499
01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:16,790
the strongest

1500
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:22,000
and so the sparql then developed between the sphere and then graph provided that you're

1501
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,250
close enough

1502
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,420
so you do

1503
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:26,180
achieve a

1504
01:35:26,190 --> 01:35:28,180
electric field close

1505
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:31,010
so this sphere of about three million

1506
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:32,500
paul's meeting

1507
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:34,740
and i will show you that later you will see

1508
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:36,230
more sparks today

1509
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:38,250
you've never seen before in your life

1510
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:40,880
but i want you to appreciate a little bit more

1511
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:43,660
the sparks about lightning

1512
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:48,080
i demonstrated that so you get a little bit more of it

1513
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:50,170
if i approached then the ground

1514
01:35:50,170 --> 01:35:51,820
not with the sphere

1515
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,660
but i would walk to defend the graph

1516
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:58,730
being very courageous like this i'm also pretty good conductor

1517
01:35:58,740 --> 01:35:59,670
i'm also

1518
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:01,200
connected with your

1519
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,460
and the chances are

1520
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:06,820
why develop first between my notes and the graph because that is

1521
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,270
the smallest of the shops curvature the small brains

1522
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:12,470
we're certainly my head would be

1523
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,740
good candidate for being hit first

1524
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:19,770
if i approach to graph like this with my hand stretched

1525
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:24,240
then chances are of course that sparks will first developed my fingertips

1526
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:25,960
because it's a very small radius

1527
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:27,860
and they're very close to the graph

1528
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:29,130
so that's where

1529
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:30,850
the discharge real

1530
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,350
walker so before

1531
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:36,210
we will enjoy some of this

1532
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:38,960
you will enjoy it i will enjoy it less

1533
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:44,640
i want to talk a little about about lightning you first

1534
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:47,380
because what you're going to see you know ways to form

1535
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,500
of lightning

1536
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:54,680
there are four hundred thousand thunderstorms every day on average honours

1537
01:36:54,680 --> 01:37:03,500
four hundred thousand thunderstorms there about hundred lightning flashes every second

1538
01:37:03,610 --> 01:37:06,110
the top of the thunder clouds

1539
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:08,440
becomes positive and the bottom

1540
01:37:08,450 --> 01:37:10,210
becomes negative

1541
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:11,720
the physics of that

1542
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:17,520
not so easy and probably incomplete and i will not go into the details of

1543
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,210
the physics but it does have to do

1544
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,440
with the flow of water drops

1545
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,670
become elongated can become charged because of friction

1546
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:25,910
they can break off

1547
01:37:25,930 --> 01:37:27,240
and they can transport

1548
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:30,900
i will simply

1549
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:32,820
if you some facts

1550
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,920
and so i will accept the fact that

1551
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:36,070
the cloud

1552
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:38,290
going to be charged

1553
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:40,930
this is the cloud

1554
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:42,910
positive at the top

1555
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,900
negative at the bottom

1556
01:37:44,910 --> 01:37:46,720
and here is the

1557
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:48,210
because of induction

1558
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:50,160
yes of course will therefore

1559
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:53,000
become positively charged here

1560
01:37:53,050 --> 01:37:55,230
so we're going to see field lines

1561
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:56,780
electric field lines

1562
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:58,650
go from the earth

1563
01:37:58,690 --> 01:38:01,070
the cloud always perpendicular

1564
01:38:01,130 --> 01:38:04,690
the equipotentials

1565
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:07,740
something like this

1566
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:10,000
you some dimensions

1567
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:12,860
this may be

1568
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:17,170
something like five kilometres

1569
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:19,720
this vertical distance

1570
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:22,650
it's about one kilometre

1571
01:38:22,650 --> 01:38:25,330
typical numbers of course can vary enormously

1572
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:27,770
from thunderstorms thunderstorm

1573
01:38:27,790 --> 01:38:30,220
and this height

1574
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:31,710
something typically

1575
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:34,650
like ten kilometres

1576
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:37,230
this allows us now to make some very interesting

1577
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:42,850
calculations to get some feeling for the potential difference between the cloud and the earth

1578
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:44,730
the first thing we can do

1579
01:38:44,730 --> 01:38:47,220
if we make the simplifying assumptions

1580
01:38:47,230 --> 01:38:51,460
that the electric field is more or less constant here is like having two parallel

1581
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:55,240
but electric field is constant between them

1582
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:58,440
then the potential difference delta p

1583
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:01,240
between the bottom of the clouds and the earth's

1584
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:04,790
is simply the electric field times the distance d

1585
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:07,050
so this becomes a

1586
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:08,680
times still

1587
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,410
but if the breakdown occurs at three million volt per meter

1588
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:14,710
by the way that's dry air

1589
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:19,720
when when there's a thunderstorm is probably not so but let's take three million volts

1590
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,670
per meter

1591
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:22,800
so we get three times ten to six

1592
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:23,980
that is for you

1593
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,280
and the distance between the cloud and the earth let's take one kilometres for that

1594
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:30,390
kind of the thirty metres

1595
01:39:30,430 --> 01:39:32,710
so we get the order of three

1596
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:36,040
a billion volts between earth and the club

1597
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:40,660
and the values that are typically measured by several hundred million to one billion involved

1598
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:43,500
so it is not all that different

1599
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,390
you expect that the

1600
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:50,880
probably less than what we have calculated because clearly

1601
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,940
we can assume that

1602
01:39:53,500 --> 01:40:01,190
this defect right full has the dirichlet distribution with some hyperparameters of

1603
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:02,770
OK so i think

1604
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:04,860
so i have

1605
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:13,940
so it follows dirichlet distribution and then that the

1606
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:15,170
the count

1607
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:20,200
i i generated according to multinomial with that you know parameter vector and say we

1608
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:27,520
just fix the document length OK we just assume the document is given right

1609
01:40:27,550 --> 01:40:28,720
so then we

1610
01:40:28,730 --> 01:40:31,240
you know we get of this we get this simple

1611
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:34,210
creation here you know it's just that

1612
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:38,440
and if we

1613
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:43,330
and and here the the PFA did you give enough which has been the ocean

1614
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:47,410
distribution cases just equation for the dirichlet distribution

1615
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:50,700
what that does is basically

1616
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:53,890
you know it just makes the

1617
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:59,310
assumption like you do in this future if you've seen that before this hierarchical bayesian

1618
01:40:59,570 --> 01:41:04,230
modeling approach that you know all these parameters of the first level of the bottom

1619
01:41:04,230 --> 01:41:10,760
level of the fetus right come from the population might be drawn they come from

1620
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:12,490
a common populations

1621
01:41:12,510 --> 01:41:17,310
in a way they get they get coupled right but through these hyperparameters

1622
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:22,110
because basically you know there's one theta here and the second one it's kind of

1623
01:41:22,110 --> 01:41:25,250
more likely that you know they come from the same distribution

1624
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:28,690
you know they they kind of influence each other so particular you know

1625
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:32,750
right so it's

1626
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:35,640
it's not very sophisticated coupling

1627
01:41:35,650 --> 01:41:37,270
OK but

1628
01:41:37,290 --> 01:41:39,860
but it's a very simple way of of

1629
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:41,440
moving things here

1630
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:46,160
well and then you can actually

1631
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:48,460
what you can do is you can actually

1632
01:41:48,490 --> 01:41:53,660
following strategy like empirical bayes

1633
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:54,660
OK so

1634
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:58,530
empirical bayes what you would do then is

1635
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:01,660
maximize the evidence

1636
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:03,850
so you would actually

1637
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:08,460
try to find the value of your hyperparameter far

1638
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:14,150
that maximizes the evidence and that's basically the probability of all the counts that you

1639
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:17,230
right given of

1640
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:20,150
so what you do here you integrate out this

1641
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:25,560
theta parameters right the fitted parameters are integrated out and then used to determine the

1642
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:30,570
optimal phi and of course what you would really want to do is also integrate

1643
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:35,050
you over of all possible outcomes but you know an empirical bayes

1644
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:38,700
you know we just try to find an optimal estimate the point estimates for the

1645
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:39,810
size of

1646
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:44,120
so we can write down what is actually is

1647
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:48,890
by explicitly integrating out the fate of

1648
01:42:48,890 --> 01:42:54,100
and then we we basically get this equation here we with a lot of gamma

1649
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:58,870
OK and then you can look this up actually in the

1650
01:42:58,890 --> 01:43:01,180
the reference that i had before

1651
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:04,700
here this mikalai i and

1652
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:11,980
you know how you then actually go about optimizing

1653
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:16,100
in computing the maximum of the function can in one way to do is just

1654
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:18,770
to understand it you know new

1655
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:21,830
the optimisation

1656
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:25,410
however you know because that's often

1657
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,810
a little bit involved people often

1658
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:32,350
resort to what i call the popular approximation here

1659
01:43:32,350 --> 01:43:33,830
which is

1660
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:39,450
you know instead of optimizing the evidence explicitly they just take it proportional to the

1661
01:43:39,450 --> 01:43:41,660
reference distribution

1662
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,430
right so they just assume that holds

1663
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:47,080
and just have one degree of freedom which is

1664
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:51,680
you know what weight is given to the reference distribution so that the weight you

1665
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:55,370
and then they use that OK so that's what the practice and people have found

1666
01:43:55,370 --> 01:43:58,660
that that's actually follow the the applications

1667
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:02,810
you know doesn't you're not losing much compared to the

1668
01:44:03,930 --> 01:44:05,950
approach where you actually compute

1669
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:09,750
the optimal find and you know the more sophisticated

1670
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:15,930
so then if you

1671
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:19,080
you know if you if you plug this big what you would get

1672
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:25,250
as you're for years smoothing is basically that you know these these are weights that

1673
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:26,580
you compute somehow

1674
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:29,560
it's basically what you will add to your account

1675
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:33,950
so the way you know again this this population approach comes into play

1676
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:40,160
is that the columns are cemented by these pseudo com which are exactly these hyperparameters

1677
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:49,330
and and if you plug in the that's what i call the popular approximation

1678
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:53,790
if that if the offers are proportional to the reference distribution

1679
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:56,370
with you know

1680
01:44:56,730 --> 01:45:00,540
scalar mu here you can plug those into this equation

1681
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:01,370
and then

1682
01:45:01,390 --> 01:45:02,830
what you get is

1683
01:45:02,890 --> 01:45:04,680
this formula here

1684
01:45:04,750 --> 01:45:07,890
basically you see that in that case

1685
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:09,120
you get again

1686
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:17,480
and interpolation between the maximum likelihood estimate and the reference distribution

1687
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:19,850
and you can also see that again

1688
01:45:19,870 --> 01:45:25,500
this has the nice property that the interpolation weights for long documents

1689
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:28,120
this you will go to one

1690
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:32,640
right the constant mews so you would do less moving for longer documents and for

1691
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:38,390
sure documents he would most like so that comes out naturally

1692
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:39,850
in this

1693
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:41,430
bayesian framework

1694
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:46,080
so it's a special case of linear interpolation

1695
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:51,310
can i ask for the time this point seven

1696
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:53,930
seven minutes OK

1697
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:59,450
OK and then there's this if i know

1698
01:45:59,450 --> 01:46:05,660
three five five assuming that we're using decimal numbers one

1699
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:08,060
don't cheat

1700
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:11,580
hopefully these are not yet sorted we'd like to sort them

1701
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:15,890
so the first thing we do is take the least significant digits

1702
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:17,970
sort by the least significant digit

1703
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:23,060
and whenever we have equal elements like these two nines we preserve the relative order

1704
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:26,910
three to nine is going to remain above eighty three nine doesn't matter here because

1705
01:46:26,910 --> 01:46:30,160
we doing the last sort but the first sort

1706
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:34,950
but in general we always using a stable sorting algorithm so when we

1707
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:37,470
sorting by this column

1708
01:46:37,510 --> 01:46:44,390
first we get the zero so that's seven two zero then we get

1709
01:46:44,410 --> 01:46:48,260
six five three five five

1710
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:51,160
then we get six

1711
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,560
four three six

1712
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:55,830
i mean i make mistake then we get the sevens

1713
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:57,800
so we preserve the order

1714
01:46:57,810 --> 01:47:00,260
it happens to be the right order

1715
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:02,030
may not be at this point

1716
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,390
we've looked at the other digits

1717
01:47:04,430 --> 01:47:08,280
then we get that looks like the nines those two lines

1718
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:09,780
three two nine

1719
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:14,600
and eight three nine

1720
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:16,310
right so far

1721
01:47:17,490 --> 01:47:21,510
now we sort by the middle digit

1722
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:23,600
the next we significant

1723
01:47:23,620 --> 01:47:27,810
and we started out with looks like that chooses to appear

1724
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:29,660
two down here

1725
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:34,100
so first read the first in first

1726
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:36,160
three two nine

1727
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:39,580
then we sort by the we have the threes

1728
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,560
so we have four three six

1729
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:47,370
and it three nine

1730
01:47:47,390 --> 01:47:49,470
then we have a bunch of

1731
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:52,510
five the looks like i missed anyone

1732
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:53,990
there are no good

1733
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:56,510
we have three five

1734
01:47:56,530 --> 01:47:58,760
we have three five five

1735
01:47:58,780 --> 01:48:01,560
we have four five seven

1736
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:04,720
and we have six five seven

1737
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:08,740
like to check that i haven't lost in helmand so we have seven here seven

1738
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:11,330
here and seven elements here

1739
01:48:11,350 --> 01:48:15,580
finally we sort by the last digit one thing to notice by the way his

1740
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:20,160
before we sort by last into currently these numbers don't resemble sort order at all

1741
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:23,660
but if you look at everything beyond the data we haven't yet sorted so these

1742
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,560
digits that's nice and sort it

1743
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:32,350
two zero to nine three sixty nine five five five seven five seven critical

1744
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:35,330
but was finishing off

1745
01:48:35,350 --> 01:48:39,890
so we stably sort by the first digit and the sparse number we get is

1746
01:48:41,410 --> 01:48:44,260
so the get three to nine

1747
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,310
and then

1748
01:48:46,330 --> 01:48:49,850
three five five

1749
01:48:49,870 --> 01:48:54,490
then we get some four four three six

1750
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:56,810
four five seven

1751
01:48:56,850 --> 01:49:02,450
then we get looks like a six

1752
01:49:02,450 --> 01:49:05,310
six seven

1753
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:08,800
eight seven

1754
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:13,430
and then we have an eight

1755
01:49:13,450 --> 01:49:20,160
check still have seven else because the lost anyone and indeed there are now in

1756
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:21,310
sorted order

1757
01:49:21,330 --> 01:49:24,370
you can start to see was working when i have equal elements here i've already

1758
01:49:24,370 --> 01:49:26,100
sorted the suffix

1759
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:27,760
so let's write perform

1760
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:33,580
so what this algorithm is doing

1761
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:38,410
what's nice about his we're not we're not partitioning independence we always keep a huge

1762
01:49:38,410 --> 01:49:40,660
batch of elements in one big pile

1763
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:43,080
but we're just going through it multiple times

1764
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:47,760
in general need to go through multiple times hopefully not too many times

1765
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:52,370
but first argued reference

1766
01:49:52,370 --> 01:49:55,780
most families running time is a little bit tricky here

1767
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:59,240
because it depends how you partition into digits

1768
01:49:59,390 --> 01:50:04,240
this is easy we and on the digit position

1769
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:07,120
that we're currently sorting

1770
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:10,350
let's call that t

1771
01:50:10,410 --> 01:50:13,850
and we can assume by induction

1772
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:17,310
that sort of beyond agency

1773
01:50:17,330 --> 01:50:21,580
this is unmatched hypothesis

1774
01:50:21,660 --> 01:50:25,850
so we assume that

1775
01:50:25,870 --> 01:50:29,410
sorted on the low order

1776
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:31,010
t minus one digits

1777
01:50:35,910 --> 01:50:40,240
and then the next thing we do is sort on the two stages

1778
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:47,760
OK we need to check things work and we restore the induction hypothesis party instead

1779
01:50:47,810 --> 01:50:49,060
t minus one

1780
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:54,490
when we sort entity digit there's two cases if we look at any two elements

1781
01:50:54,490 --> 01:50:56,640
who want to know whether they put in the right order

1782
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:57,930
so yes

1783
01:50:58,180 --> 01:51:01,030
two elements

1784
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:03,830
are the same

1785
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:06,970
so they have the same t digital

1786
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:19,010
this is the case if they have the same t digit

1787
01:51:19,850 --> 01:51:23,510
their order should not be changed by stability

1788
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:26,240
we know that they remain in the same order

1789
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:35,990
because the bill is supposed to preserve things that have the same key that we're

1790
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:39,310
sorting them by the induction hypothesis

1791
01:51:39,410 --> 01:51:44,160
we know that keeps them in sorted order because they used to be

1792
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:47,600
actually about this is that they used to be sort of

1793
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:52,160
adding on this value in the front it's the same in both doesn't change anything

1794
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:53,660
so there remains one

1795
01:51:53,660 --> 01:51:55,390
and if they have

1796
01:51:57,010 --> 01:52:01,450
it is

1797
01:52:01,470 --> 01:52:18,200
then this sorting step will put them in the right order

1798
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:21,200
because that's what sorting does

1799
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:24,680
this is the most significant digit so you've got off by the teeth vision if

1800
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:26,850
they differ the rest are o

1801
01:52:26,910 --> 01:52:27,990
the proof here

1802
01:52:28,030 --> 01:52:30,490
of correct this is very simple

1803
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:33,350
once you know the algorithm

1804
01:52:34,540 --> 01:52:35,560
any questions

1805
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:36,540
before we go on

1806
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:46,260
so we're going to use counting sort

1807
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:52,410
we could use any story our algorithm we want individual digits

1808
01:52:52,410 --> 01:52:55,940
if you have a conditional random fields you need to use exactly the sampling techniques

1809
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:58,160
that number talked about

1810
01:52:58,830 --> 01:53:02,430
two very will be talking a lot more about that in this graphical model scores

1811
01:53:02,430 --> 01:53:04,870
next week

1812
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:15,080
we could for instance ask for all ask just count how many labels so wrong

1813
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:18,750
that's a very simple one i mean you can think of much more complicated ones

1814
01:53:18,890 --> 01:53:21,060
just trying to keep things simple

1815
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:25,390
this inner product between for fixed and y and w

1816
01:53:25,410 --> 01:53:28,270
would be just well i might have some w one

1817
01:53:28,290 --> 01:53:29,500
for that term here

1818
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:31,910
w two for this

1819
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:34,200
this these are of different data types

1820
01:53:34,210 --> 01:53:37,870
this is in some feature space that section number

1821
01:53:37,890 --> 01:53:44,160
they just need to wait which after corresponding datatype otherwise it doesn't work

1822
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:47,120
the full column generation

1823
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:52,210
i get this additional term here y i y fronts

1824
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:56,430
what we actually have to do is we have to maximize

1825
01:53:56,480 --> 01:54:00,350
the sum of all of all those terms

1826
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:04,100
if all the while i very independent of each other and no pairwise interactions are

1827
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:06,850
happening this would be trivial right

1828
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:12,730
i'll just pick whatever y is locally optimal like it decomposing some everything's fine

1829
01:54:12,830 --> 01:54:14,350
however here

1830
01:54:14,410 --> 01:54:15,370
i have

1831
01:54:15,430 --> 01:54:21,060
a function which depends on adjacent terms why i one plus one

1832
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:22,210
now who

1833
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:25,520
has heard of dynamic programming

1834
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:30,960
who is implemented dynamic programming algorithm himself

1835
01:54:31,870 --> 01:54:34,230
i would say you have an advantage

1836
01:54:35,540 --> 01:54:37,960
let's go through it in detail

1837
01:54:37,980 --> 01:54:43,390
these are just way be part of the weight vector

1838
01:54:43,430 --> 01:54:48,390
so that this would actually be a number this would be something in feature space

1839
01:54:50,830 --> 01:54:55,100
now let me show you what how we can do this

1840
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:57,680
sexual seventy thousand the slides

1841
01:54:57,710 --> 01:55:00,160
let's just go through it a very very slowly

1842
01:55:00,230 --> 01:55:06,750
so we have

1843
01:55:06,750 --> 01:55:10,500
the problem of maximizing

1844
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:12,600
of y

1845
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:15,370
going from articles one

1846
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,290
to l

1847
01:55:19,060 --> 01:55:21,100
why i

1848
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:25,180
why i plus one

1849
01:55:29,230 --> 01:55:30,440
by the way is it

1850
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:31,660
is everybody OK

1851
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:39,120
to see how the sum over all those terms can result in into this function

1852
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:43,320
basically what's happening is see this time you just depends on why i OK so

1853
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:45,960
i just like it straight here

1854
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:49,680
the next but the pairwise terms i'm just prior to to april while i was

1855
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:53,210
one that's the term that just depends on the singer y i think apply here

1856
01:55:53,210 --> 01:55:55,480
as well

1857
01:55:55,520 --> 01:56:00,560
and just ignoring things that the boundaries just because i'm being a bit sloppy

1858
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:04,770
is a medical with that

1859
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:16,810
and see where the sum goes from i one to l so that's a big

1860
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:25,270
well i can write this out as follows

1861
01:56:25,330 --> 01:56:28,350
i can

1862
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:31,100
right it as

1863
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:34,060
the same thing as the max

1864
01:56:34,810 --> 01:56:36,540
y one

1865
01:56:37,310 --> 01:56:40,850
y two trails

1866
01:56:40,870 --> 01:56:44,060
often in

1867
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:45,460
of well

1868
01:56:45,460 --> 01:56:47,710
y one

1869
01:56:47,770 --> 01:56:49,580
y two

1870
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:51,080
plus the sum

1871
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:52,850
i going from two

1872
01:56:52,850 --> 01:56:54,500
two l

1873
01:56:54,850 --> 01:56:57,270
why i

1874
01:56:57,270 --> 01:56:59,210
why i lost

1875
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:06,910
what you can see is

1876
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:08,850
but i can maximize

1877
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:12,390
the second term doesn't depend on y one anymore

1878
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:17,600
if i knew what y two would be

1879
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:22,730
i could work out what the optimum value of y one is

1880
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:25,850
so what in is for all possible values of y two

1881
01:57:25,940 --> 01:57:28,830
work at the optimal value of y one

1882
01:57:28,850 --> 01:57:32,230
it's not too hard because i mean what can only take on two different values

1883
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:35,710
y one only takes into different values i just evaluate this piece

1884
01:57:35,770 --> 01:57:39,310
for all its four different quite possible configurations

1885
01:57:39,430 --> 01:57:41,410
and like it

1886
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:44,060
the following function

1887
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:49,000
of light two

1888
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:52,230
just the mass

1889
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:54,850
of y one

1890
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:58,100
what i want

1891
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:00,540
and y two

1892
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:03,810
so now what i can do is

1893
01:58:03,830 --> 01:58:07,330
i can just get rid of the maximisation one

1894
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:11,290
and they get the problem which looks as follows GFY two

1895
01:58:11,290 --> 01:58:13,200
plus this piece

1896
01:58:13,230 --> 01:58:17,250
and maximize the wife to y o

1897
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:19,500
so i can write this

1898
01:58:20,410 --> 01:58:22,310
that's it somewhere i store

1899
01:58:22,330 --> 01:58:23,620
the function of

1900
01:58:23,710 --> 01:58:26,480
why one of y two

1901
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:30,680
i support this

1902
01:58:30,730 --> 01:58:33,810
against all this in the two what to

1903
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:36,180
as actually just need two numbers

1904
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:40,870
y two being one i need to find out what happened before

1905
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:44,640
y one y two being minus one thousand

1906
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,270
so now

1907
01:58:47,310 --> 01:58:49,430
so this is

1908
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:50,850
i can do the following

1909
01:58:50,890 --> 01:58:53,640
take the max o y two

1910
01:58:54,730 --> 01:58:55,830
now y three

1911
01:58:55,890 --> 01:58:57,660
to l

1912
01:58:59,830 --> 01:59:01,520
of y so

1913
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:04,370
of y two

1914
01:59:04,410 --> 01:59:06,290
y three

1915
01:59:06,370 --> 01:59:08,000
plus the sum

1916
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,460
i came from three

1917
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:11,520
of f

1918
01:59:11,540 --> 01:59:13,330
of y i

1919
01:59:13,390 --> 01:59:17,080
what are plus one

1920
01:59:18,180 --> 01:59:21,830
i can again combine terms

1921
01:59:21,850 --> 01:59:23,540
and i get the

1922
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:25,680
of y three

1923
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:27,040
let's call this

1924
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:28,500
g two

1925
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:31,100
g three y three

1926
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:34,330
just defined as the max

1927
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:36,660
of y two

1928
01:59:37,350 --> 01:59:39,480
now g

1929
01:59:40,830 --> 01:59:42,730
of y two

1930
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:45,890
of y two

1931
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:48,430
and y three

1932
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:49,810
and then i go

1933
01:59:49,810 --> 01:59:54,410
and for all

1934
01:59:54,430 --> 01:59:55,600
y two

1935
01:59:55,640 --> 02:00:00,180
the function of one three

1936
02:00:00,410 --> 02:00:03,660
and you continue

1937
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:06,330
i'm not going to

1938
02:00:06,350 --> 02:00:08,680
do the same reasoning for why three now

1939
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:11,940
you can easily see that if i keep on doing this at some point early

1940
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:15,910
that at the end of this recursion

1941
02:00:15,980 --> 02:00:18,370
now at the end of the recursion what they will have

1942
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:21,330
is the maximisation of one last variables

1943
02:00:21,370 --> 02:00:24,430
namely while plus one

1944
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:27,930
now we know what values

1945
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:29,270
i want to have this

1946
02:00:29,290 --> 02:00:31,200
i just went backwards pass

1947
02:00:31,210 --> 02:00:33,000
because i know what wales

1948
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:36,100
will be as a function of wild was one

1949
02:00:36,120 --> 02:00:39,690
i think the look up for while minus one one minus two and i just

1950
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:45,410
well basically and rounds entire recursion backwards

1951
02:00:45,430 --> 02:00:49,980
that's like the forward backward pass if you've

1952
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:56,940
done something like to be i was before you life that's basically what's happening here

1953
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:57,710
this is

1954
02:00:57,730 --> 02:00:59,060
i can solve

1955
02:00:59,080 --> 02:01:03,890
this maximization problem here in that time

1956
02:01:03,930 --> 02:01:05,160
the before

1957
02:01:05,180 --> 02:01:07,350
it will be

1958
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:09,770
of l

1959
02:01:09,770 --> 02:01:13,380
well it kind of depends on what you think is driving the problem in each

1960
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:18,340
of these things suggested different levels different types of things you might do so for

1961
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:22,210
example if it's more convenient should you change the environment

1962
02:01:22,230 --> 02:01:24,710
to make the unhealthy food

1963
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:28,610
convenient make healthy foods more convenient

1964
02:01:28,670 --> 02:01:30,000
that would make sense

1965
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,280
but if this is the reason is what people like to eat what would you

1966
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:37,340
do about that actually created drug that takes away the pleasure from some of these

1967
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:41,500
unhealthy foods or could you train people to believe that they are not good for

1968
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:43,420
you et cetera

1969
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:48,020
if it's too heavily advertised well that screams out for government regulation to cut back

1970
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:49,710
on marketing

1971
02:01:49,710 --> 02:01:53,900
o talk a lot about marketing what government can and cannot do about it

1972
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:58,380
if it's more affordable of course you want to use an economic intervention

1973
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:01,500
so could use taxes and subsidies for example

1974
02:02:01,590 --> 02:02:05,750
to raise the price of food that you think people should be doing less of

1975
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:10,750
and lower the price of things you would like people even more certainly a possibility

1976
02:02:10,750 --> 02:02:15,320
and the people don't know which foods are healthy woman argues for education

1977
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:20,400
but notice that that was almost almost trying things people said

1978
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:24,300
so that would suggest that education is probably not going to get the job done

1979
02:02:24,300 --> 02:02:26,000
because that's not the mean

1980
02:02:26,050 --> 02:02:30,800
driving reason because most people know that they should need so much stuff

1981
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:35,020
but education is what we default to when we think about what to do so

1982
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:39,780
really all these things are potentially interesting possibilities

1983
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:43,820
and the question is what makes most sense will sort through all these and discussed

1984
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:47,550
what society might do to help change

1985
02:02:47,550 --> 02:02:52,480
food preferences in food intake patterns in the side

1986
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:55,980
so we have to ask ourselves which of these is true

1987
02:02:56,050 --> 02:02:59,780
if people are eating too much junk food which of these is

1988
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,270
and although

1989
02:03:01,270 --> 02:03:06,110
most of you would probably say well it's real all these things are involved in

1990
02:03:06,130 --> 02:03:07,710
least to some extent

1991
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:13,400
society defaults to certain assumptions about what's driving food intake

1992
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:17,050
and there are some people that default to environmental

1993
02:03:17,050 --> 02:03:22,800
explanation of this it's marketing its economics it's the environment is set up in such

1994
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:28,570
a way to make these foods very appealing and very attractive people that's why the

1995
02:03:28,570 --> 02:03:29,860
but other people

1996
02:03:29,860 --> 02:03:35,750
in fact probably a larger percentage fall to the top option here

1997
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:40,960
that these are personal health issues rather than public health issues

1998
02:03:40,980 --> 02:03:44,210
the people are making choices about what they

1999
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:48,210
if they make bad choices is therefore

2000
02:03:48,250 --> 02:03:52,540
and so you either need to implore them to behave differently you need to coerce

2001
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:57,050
to behave differently or you need to educate them

2002
02:03:57,150 --> 02:03:58,840
to behave differently

2003
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:04,440
and you can see these two camps of thoughts would generate far different approaches to

2004
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:09,110
dealing with dietary crises on the international scene

2005
02:04:09,170 --> 02:04:13,360
so we'll walk through these but of course there are players

2006
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:14,840
now i'm going to show you two

2007
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:19,610
you may have seen these on TV once from burger king

2008
02:04:19,630 --> 02:04:22,110
and one is from KFC

2009
02:04:22,150 --> 02:04:26,280
and what i showed this to you was we'll talk a lot about food marketing

2010
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:30,630
in the united states because if you buy the premise that i laid out of

2011
02:04:30,630 --> 02:04:35,320
few moments ago that what we consider food and what we consider to taste good

2012
02:04:35,340 --> 02:04:39,230
it's pretty much a total social construction

2013
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:43,210
i mean not to complete social construction for example know where in the world what

2014
02:04:43,210 --> 02:04:45,690
people consider a rock

2015
02:04:45,710 --> 02:04:51,750
because the rockies non-food across all cultures but aside from that there is great variability
