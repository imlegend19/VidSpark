1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,310
are attached to something like a box

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,640
on the part of the

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,490
o which is called the soundboard

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,470
we analyse the some four

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,970
the soundboard is a must

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,540
for you to here

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,960
the tone

8
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,920
if you have a strange

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,890
and you would also late that string

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,630
added resonance frequency with rocket and go into those

11
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,590
you wouldn't here

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,280
the reason is that the

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,960
the amount of and this place is solenoidal because the string is so small

14
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,790
that is just not enough

15
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,010
disturbance in the air you can hear it

16
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,540
so what you do

17
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,040
you monthly strings

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,120
on the box

19
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,590
on the surface

20
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,990
in the case of the piano

21
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,180
the piece of wood

22
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,890
and that is what starts to oscillate because the string oscillates in the strings mounted

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,760
on it

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,710
and so

25
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,140
the whole board starts to oscillate

26
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,930
now the amount of energy this this place is much higher

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,120
you can hear it

28
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,080
this is easy to demonstrate

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,160
i have here

30
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,800
during four

31
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,960
four four

32
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:21,030
it's not modelled on anything i think you can you can hardly rules

33
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,170
i can now you can hear

34
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,380
the portal box on the table

35
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,600
you will be able to hear it

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:42,010
one or

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,880
even today

38
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:51,530
so that's the function

39
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,540
all of these

40
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,700
some boards

41
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,720
and that's the reason why these

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,990
tuning forks

43
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,540
all mounted on boxes which is the soundboard

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,920
and so that

45
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,530
make sound

46
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:13,580
loud enough for you to years

47
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,290
i have yet to win a little music box

48
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,420
there are problems

49
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,170
and i rotate this

50
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,290
drum around these little prongs do this

51
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,580
he also late different frequencies

52
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,630
i don't think you can he it

53
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,540
not impressive right

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,160
i put the table

55
00:02:50,170 --> 00:03:01,200
that's the reason why you need a large surface

56
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,170
two oscillate

57
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,540
in the old days i remember

58
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,950
that in wine cellars

59
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,090
the all of the wine cellars could tell

60
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,670
what the level of the wine walls in the barrel

61
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,090
and he will do that by knocking on it

62
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:26,030
and in the beginning of his at the level where there is liquid

63
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,620
very little sound when he reaches the whole part

64
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,250
very large

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,290
and that upper part can easily oscillate the liquid cannot

66
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,810
that's one way of telling

67
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:45,540
which of these barrels filled with some substance in which is hollow

68
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,620
if i had known brains at all

69
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,120
and if i would bring this tooling for

70
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,490
i put on my head and open my mouth you'd allowed told

71
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,880
i can demonstrate this

72
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:08,070
more impressive right you don't hear much

73
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,640
that's maybe why i'm at MIT

74
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:18,390
yes my expertise certain john miller not just stay there until

75
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,370
just as they really were

76
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,700
john very my fellow

77
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,100
we can also test whether

78
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,790
he has a brain

79
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,630
getting nervous i can tell

80
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,670
what is truly for going ahead you open your mouth and we will hear nothing

81
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,930
from the right

82
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:50,420
but you get the right to

83
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,220
what are

84
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,670
sixty four

85
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:11,130
so string and wind instruments they resonate

86
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,590
very unique

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,350
you experts now we called harmonic

88
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,830
natural frequencies

89
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,620
but all objects

90
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,760
have resonant frequencies and not just one but a whole zoo

91
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,950
of resonant frequencies which sometimes

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,500
a very mysterious and not so easy

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,130
as an example

94
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,720
i have here a wine glass

95
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,040
and this is a very complicated

96
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,420
piece of glass

97
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,680
i can make

98
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,570
this glass itself not talking about and i was about

99
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,450
the glass itself also lay

100
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,380
in a zillion different

101
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,380
so what i was really referring to is i finally got her to use macintosh

102
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,500
thank you very much for thank you want just briefly thank donnelly elliot the people

103
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:12,270
don't really mostly work for making this meeting happened the management will yield a chance

104
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,770
to see all the cell in the front row here

105
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:23,680
so and more than that i also want to thank all of you guys for

106
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
coming today

107
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,220
from all these different fields among its think

108
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,470
everyone in the audience and the

109
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,030
particularly if course invited speakers i feel really good line-up of top people from different

110
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,120
fields to come talk to everyone thank them all

111
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,580
for taking the time to come

112
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,400
o two meeting that they don't usually come to

113
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,540
and in two

114
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:52,360
a strange country within a country called back might not normally get to so that

115
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,490
i really appreciate that and what i want to try to use that you know

116
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,120
as well as doing so we don't always get together so let's let's communicate let's

117
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,240
share ideas and celebrate

118
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,770
this this this field

119
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,630
and this group of fields

120
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,460
and i've i when i invited to speak the speakers to cameras where each one

121
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,860
of them to to share their view what's going on to take some of their

122
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,660
time to give a little history and a personal perspective how they came the field

123
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,040
as as

124
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,960
ask and answer the questions like

125
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,910
now why are people in your area not just you but why why there just

126
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,880
in your area in the ideas of reinforcement learning

127
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,500
so if we look

128
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,660
and what's going on

129
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,690
the premise of this meaning the premises meanings that reinforcement learning ideas are having an

130
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,580
impact on on many different areas so we can list machine learning and AI

131
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,930
control theory operations research neuroscience psychology and economics

132
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,610
and if then you can find places where

133
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:59,190
these ideas are used and in particular even the particular algorithms are used so let's

134
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:04,690
raise the bar a little bit and and we can group these things into lists

135
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:12,060
four different areas that are really really different they have different criteria for success different

136
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,320
reasons for being interested so

137
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,340
machine learning and AI maybe

138
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,290
we started begun there

139
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,380
but and and and now control operations research these are little bit have some similar

140
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,310
goals many i think if you ask you know like dimitri bertsekas and why he

141
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,700
is interested in if you just like my stuart russell director interested in reinforcement is

142
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,380
not they're not just the same they have some different great interest different kinds of

143
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,850
rigour different degrees of exploratory possibilities

144
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,450
so those are very different in practice obviously neuroscience and psychology those have totally different

145
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,100
ways of measuring utility

146
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:00,870
and so like psychology in the first place temple difference learning i algorithm to the

147
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,510
td lambda

148
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,630
like alkanes were published was in psychology and it was

149
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,280
it was published on its own merits wasn't like this system call machine learning stuff

150
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,200
maybe it has implications for psychology was just psychology

151
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,100
and we feel can science today there's a little bit of carry-over but really it's

152
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:23,820
evaluated the temple distance-learning learning ideas and reinforcing ideas more generally are evaluated by their

153
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,670
success in predicting data in explaining data and so that's i think really special effect

154
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,010
and say

155
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,630
so four at least four different

156
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,260
very different research communities with different criteria

157
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,440
independent validation i think i'm i'm going to say that that's the first time

158
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,470
perhaps the first time that has ever happened

159
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,130
you can see kind different kinds of crossovers but independent validation forty iterations communities is

160
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,410
very special thing that's that's what i like to to think we want to celebrate

161
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,820
and talk about so what is happening why is it happening why are

162
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,190
a few ideas what can we see the same algorithms in the same idea being

163
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,640
user validated in is totally different ways

164
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,250
OK so what are these ideas

165
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,070
so let's just start superficially right we just want to relax today we've been doing

166
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,380
a lot of conferencing in many of us already and was a kind of kind

167
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,270
enjoy ourselves and let me urge you guys too

168
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,240
two it interact i don't have so much material today that it's going to be

169
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,030
there it's going to be tight and you know the point is to talk so

170
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,070
he question just bring your question right now everything comes misrepresenting something if you want

171
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,480
to refine it right that's what we want to do to find our sense of

172
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,860
what is happening that brings these fields together and you get a better sense of

173
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,210
what is sort of these ideas we just superficially talk about learning through trial and

174
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,860
error the ideas of reward and value the markov decision process framework and the specific

175
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,010
algorithms that we can see being used in these different fields

176
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,840
the goal of this talk then begin asking what are these ideas will be a

177
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,140
little less superficial let's look more deeply these ideas and which ones are actually critical

178
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,170
as opposed to just being incidental

179
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,380
care what too and then we got the final axiom that saves

180
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,880
everything that's mississippi can't have enough success

181
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,690
it's one level

182
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,110
so and then there's other reasons as to why

183
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:29,400
these regular justifications that might contain items that contain superfluous parts formatics are still parts

184
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,630
of axioms but we might get some kind of external max masking going on

185
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:39,670
and this is why we have our regular justifications

186
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,440
and this is the only justification that we have computed that we're looking at

187
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,790
and then what could happen is that we get parts of an axiom are in

188
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,590
fact here from one of the justifications inside this

189
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,210
and this combined with some other actions that may be still inside the justification

190
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,190
and they also combined with an axiom that's external to the justification

191
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,170
so what we actually end up with are

192
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:11,560
fine grained justifications was so previously but was talking about parts of axioms we also

193
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:18,290
end up with a further fine grained justifications and the regular justification here

194
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,650
mask these other justifications

195
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,730
these fine grained justifications so

196
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:30,230
really actual fact although we've got enough to understand entailment paleontology from regular justifications we

197
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,000
may not get the full picture there may be other reasons as to why didn't

198
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,940
entailment holds

199
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,940
and these are just the same as by

200
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,770
because the justifications of fine grained enough

201
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,630
axioms and justification

202
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,670
consider many parts

203
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,690
so we first this condition of external masking because it into the past inside the

204
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:00,960
justification in fact with axioms are outside the justifications produce new fine grained justifications

205
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,110
so in some sense

206
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,380
with the termite part that is what we want to think about are fine grained

207
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,650
and we defined

208
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:15,360
i did some theoretical work on this we produced definitions for this problem definitions

209
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,070
and we've come up with two new types justifications the first one the fourth one

210
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,270
is called the conic so we have the conic justifications

211
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,090
and these are justification that don't contain any superfluous parts

212
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,790
and all parts as weak as possible and this definition makes it clear

213
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,950
it is clear to exactly what part of axiom is before

214
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,830
this is is a very dedicated and some work on this but

215
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,590
their work was characterized by kind of an operational death

216
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:51,610
operationally defined definition for size justification so they just produced out twenty four computed these

217
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:58,360
computed the just produce algorithms that compute what if all fine grained justifications but

218
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,330
it wasn't clear when looking at it if they really were fine grained justifications they

219
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,870
may be difficult to compare one system to another

220
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,110
so we've got a well defined notion of passing this definition of what we and

221
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,300
then we got precise justifications and these are also the conic justifications

222
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,080
but these things here again is primarily geared towards repair

223
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,780
and the precise justifications

224
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,120
each axiom in the justification is a minimal repair small

225
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,630
flood the class descriptions don't contain any nesting i'm not going to go into too

226
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,040
many details on this now but if you want to talk to you about it

227
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,990
after you can do and there's also talk in the main conference on wednesday which

228
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:41,820
are going definition of ways of computing these things

229
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,150
so just to show you an example that

230
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,330
if we have an ontology here

231
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,370
consisting of three axioms a so close of the and exactly one r c and

232
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,070
this is nested these well condoms and seminal by the way

233
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,570
and then we also have these subclassof role c

234
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,410
and s

235
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,800
and he is equivalent exists RC

236
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,650
and flawlessly this entails that a is a subclass of the

237
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,990
hopefully you can see that but we don't require

238
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,450
everyone see that

239
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,990
we have

240
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,370
it across the that kind of pass through here if you like so we know

241
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:28,240
that it's only got a long-established sunglasses successes and here was that we know it's

242
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,780
going to have one

243
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,410
and here we require that for any can be

244
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,160
we've got the necessary and sufficient condition here so and i call this one as

245
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,710
and don't have access to services across the

246
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:46,700
so the part of the justification that are superfluous to this in this particular entailment

247
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,700
so in the first case we've got axiom here

248
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,070
and i see this across the

249
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,710
and i mean one are

250
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,590
this is taken from

251
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,840
the first section here so we remove this country be that superfluous

252
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,480
and also here

253
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:07,650
we don't actually require all of this cardinality restrictions we don't require the utmost part

254
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,610
of the exact cardinality restrictions unit acquired in part so we know

255
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,450
from what we've got here are a d and we know it's got this one

256
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,280
as successor

257
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,620
and then on the second was offered also chops off another contingent here

258
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:30,040
so we all we need is the fact that this falacy do cluster c

259
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,660
and then on third axiom we've got this superfluous part of this comes in the

260
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,280
OK so the equivalent

261
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,000
axiom here so we don't actually need the implications go one way

262
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,480
and this happens to be

263
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,990
here going right to left but here which on it

264
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,990
and that's why he had this RC and forces classify e

265
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,520
so we moved another part of the axon here

266
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:00,070
and as i say the definition of provided us what is coming justifications are

267
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,200
it makes it clear to me what parts of axioms are so there's no dispute

268
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,730
as to whether something is laconic or not

269
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:12,230
and also whether thing contains the weakest possible parts

270
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,110
so we can take a look at some of this imprecision a

271
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:25,830
so for the purposes of showing you examples of

272
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:31,660
the kind justifications i'd like to go back to the computer science

273
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,990
the ontology

274
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:44,480
and just a slight power gain to classify it

275
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,030
we noticed we've got some unsatisfiable classes

276
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:52,460
and by the way we can get an overview of some of the entailment selection

277
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,920
of instruments and this for axioms panel

278
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,650
which is on the ontology

279
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,990
we noticed some things satisfiable here

280
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,070
what is an entailment shown with this kind of

281
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,700
now cluster one slide by dashboard on a yellowish background can click the question mark

282
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,170
this is a shortcut that brings up the

283
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,610
actually just want to add all unsatisfiable classes here

284
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,650
i want to compute

285
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:34,500
i was just like book is added you can i want to compute justifications for

286
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,480
he is unsatisfiable classes so

287
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,570
you notice that there two ways in which we can

288
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,980
come look at laconic justifications in this explanation workbench

289
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:55,420
the first one is that we can compute one laconic justifications for regular justifications

290
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:04,370
so this is really a lot of things so that was really

291
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:14,110
there is a lot of XSLT

292
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,750
just for

293
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:28,130
four laps so good at all in hopes of extracting

294
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,290
information from our collection not to be here

295
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,390
the is

296
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,970
examples right so we have to try to

297
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,140
well not just in the earth

298
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,800
it is possible to write an XML schema

299
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,210
note that one

300
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,900
but you can

301
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:14,010
you have to know what you are actually so one schemas more generally

302
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,910
so what is semantic web languages and all

303
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,480
we reach actually pointed different out

304
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,250
after this

305
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,840
one thing is very important

306
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:55,990
this is what we are looking for the

307
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,070
so what can

308
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,070
a lot

309
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:09,180
four is the fourth book

310
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,340
that is the

311
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,230
are different kinds of services and some of

312
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,740
for me on

313
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,250
so there are

314
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,990
these being harvested

315
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,040
where they can

316
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,410
we have a very strong are called

317
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,250
one of the

318
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,600
thing but i will be destroyed

319
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,480
i mean the whole area that

320
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:43,690
being able to describe classes and a series of of the shows what is this

321
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,730
is this is the same

322
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,780
nobody has any

323
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,070
people who usually most

324
00:22:53,090 --> 00:23:00,090
something something of the system that is always going to be doing entirely

325
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:05,140
the fish like rule system

326
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,680
but that's not the same as we have

327
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,210
april of

328
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:18,130
that's a very important role in the reason for my

329
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,490
or try

330
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,410
these is really for

331
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,760
then he

332
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,830
or one or more

333
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,290
this is

334
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,890
this is the

335
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:50,960
the key is one of the system does it contain contradiction or

336
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,290
so some due to

337
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,690
the station

338
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,700
all rights reserved

339
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,730
so it is

340
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:25,900
he's the core

341
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,980
you should search for all the time

342
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:41,900
coming up there because you can do quite a bit analysis out

343
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,970
i so for

344
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,470
you create

345
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,810
questions quite

346
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,830
pressure and you feel

347
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,990
of all time

348
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,770
so we have things that is most

349
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,500
i one hundred

350
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,270
what is actually meant

351
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,290
however they really useful

352
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,480
you can say oh no

353
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,620
schema to start

354
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,440
you seem to be consis right now

355
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:27,660
and all really know this actually huge

356
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,910
all these two areas

357
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,060
text for this

358
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:38,770
seems to be much easier

359
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,650
so the

360
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,600
is trial

361
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:52,230
where that we need more than that

362
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,180
a lot of north

363
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,990
i mean there are

364
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,560
this representing real world money on

365
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,480
are really

366
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,380
the other thing

367
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:31,020
what you want to get more

368
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,950
the scission configurations then you can deter mined

369
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,280
all the different observable

370
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,420
and then i will show you some dynamical results

371
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,850
what we obtained concerning the mass distribution

372
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,640
so static results so we have done this

373
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,090
hartree fock calculation we have

374
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:53,970
put some constraints these elongation asymmetry constraints any clues

375
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,860
if you only look at q three equals zero

376
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,100
you have this fission barrier that prevented before

377
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:06,270
spherical shape high energy than the ground state which deform for centre point other point

378
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,060
corresponding to either mirrors

379
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:12,810
and then you have second story saying well because corresponding to either

380
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,440
the second set and then you have the valley going to

381
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,930
what we call symmetric valley was to fragment having the same as

382
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,570
but you see here that if you impose

383
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,680
the formation here

384
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,290
you can have another valley here which is the asymmetry valley and then at the

385
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,470
end you have a small fragment one

386
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,450
here you see that you can reproduce the

387
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,060
seriously fragmentation and all the different asymmetric fermentation

388
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,960
so from semantic two very asymmetric fermentation

389
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,940
so if you do that for different systems so you can find many different features

390
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,730
of the features of these neutral landscape really depends on the nucleus you are looking

391
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,800
so if you look at the toyota under twenty six iranian of family

392
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,360
you see that you can find different feature the first one concern the superlative from

393
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,200
minimum here

394
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,820
because you see i don't see anything here

395
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,060
so that's was

396
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,700
what did surprise we thought that all the actinides would have scouted for minimum so

397
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,950
fission isomers but in fact no

398
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:26,250
if you add too many neutrons support system having more than one hundred fifty six

399
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,530
neutrons you don't have disappeared one

400
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,500
so that's why in the cross section you don't see all the structure

401
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,730
you can do so that schools and the single minimum but you see here you

402
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,540
can have a family from shape here

403
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,760
four car you so

404
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,980
extensive calculations are now performed to really

405
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,500
pin down what is the difference between the

406
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,490
all the different nuclei

407
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,110
see also competition between the different values and different modes

408
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,810
in blue you you had the lowest energy

409
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,020
so you see here

410
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,160
that is for symmetric fission

411
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,700
asymmetric fission but competition between two values and here

412
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,890
it's only

413
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,210
non symmetric fission and overly here

414
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,740
so really you can not use that mean that you cannot use for dynamical calculations

415
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,940
one landscape which is calculated for one you applied to the other one you really

416
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,010
have to

417
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:30,520
to do the right calculation for the right new you're interested

418
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:36,930
now you have a question is how do we determine the scission configurations because you

419
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:40,770
know how to impose global deformations to the fissioning system

420
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,930
then you have to say OK then it's fission OK you have two fragments

421
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,000
but you are gaining not ways

422
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,520
classical object having density one and zero outside

423
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,040
you have to diffuse necessary phase

424
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:57,740
and you this interaction with a given range so you don't know you don't have

425
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,770
any topological definition

426
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,350
one of them

427
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,020
of the of decision points of what we call also the exit point

428
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,330
so that's why

429
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:11,490
you need some prescription so there are a lot of different prescriptions

430
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,690
i just mentioned here a few

431
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:18,340
the first one is that you say that you have to be separated fragments

432
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,820
when you have as nuclear

433
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,750
interaction between the fragment which is very small compared to the coulomb repulsion

434
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,860
so i mean that

435
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,750
you you

436
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:32,290
i have only two fragments interacting through coulomb so you put then

437
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,190
number and say OK

438
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,350
decision when

439
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,190
the energy is less than one person

440
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:43,190
the other criteria that can be used is the densities in a

441
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,590
even if you have the diffuse nice you can

442
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,670
calculate the density and then they can say OK these are you have two fragments

443
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,290
when the density in

444
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:55,330
is less than ten per cent of the nucleon density

445
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,080
well that create a and b news concerning the energy up when you increase the

446
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,380
energy or the decrease of all the shapes

447
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:09,260
so the criteria that i will use here is based on these low density in

448
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,860
neck so

449
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,520
if i blocked the for example the density of the nucleus when i'm through this

450
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,030
pass here

451
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:21,000
and with the two fragments having the same as

452
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,660
it's here so

453
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,230
this is the

454
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,120
this game the density

455
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,550
you have this fragmentation here

456
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,770
and if i increase the deformation you see that you have

457
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,830
gated fragment

458
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,960
and then you have the formation of an egg in the media

459
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,870
and then at the end

460
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,680
you have two well separated fragments so here

461
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,850
it was almost almost no density than a here

462
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:52,330
so this is for this image presentation and you can do that

463
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:59,300
you can do the same for

464
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,100
you can do the same for example another fragmentation so this is the most probable

465
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,200
two s dollars

466
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,640
to cut off here but there's two

467
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:14,290
right what the band or

468
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,310
they're all

469
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,340
there's no one here in brilliant

470
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,240
now again

471
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,590
there is a very

472
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,130
nine killed tools more

473
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:32,480
for all practical purposes there is no bonds between brilliant too

474
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,900
in this molecular orbital approach their right

475
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,570
four eight

476
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,500
four and it's got a p electron

477
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,340
in the atomic

478
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:54,710
so now we've got to do is going to look at the constructive in destructive

479
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,570
interference between these p

480
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,800
weight function

481
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,440
we've got to do that we gotta make molecular states we gotta let be

482
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:10,630
p wave functions the p atomic wavefunctions constructively and destructively interfere

483
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,960
to make

484
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,900
a new

485
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,570
molecular weight function

486
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,090
right rate here is how we do it

487
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,480
here's two p ex

488
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,900
the weight function

489
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,790
for the two PY weight function may look the same right one is just the

490
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,420
next dimension one is in the light dimension

491
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,530
they have no role playing right here

492
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,840
we're going to do is we're going to take that function over lapping

493
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,840
with the same way function to be at war two PY

494
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,750
from another atom

495
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:48,670
going to bring these two with an equilibrium bond length

496
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:53,300
gotta let this part of the wavefunction overlap with this part of the wave function

497
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,790
and this part of the wavefunction overlap with this

498
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,570
and we're going to treat constructive interference first

499
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,480
and the result is a weight function it kind of looks like this

500
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,880
in the centre right here we got a lot of weight function

501
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,270
his right here we have a constructive interference

502
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:17,000
in the centre here we got a lot of weight function

503
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,400
right along the into nuclear axis we got an little plane

504
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,320
well we got an all playing there because we we had no plane

505
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,730
in the atomic wavefunctions to begin with

506
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:37,130
so there are no role-playing is maintained here

507
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:45,190
o k

508
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,670
molecular weight function here

509
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,750
it's going to have a different name

510
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,690
because this is the different symmetry

511
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,550
right this way function is not

512
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:02,520
cylindrically symmetric around the bond axis there's wave function of the bond axis wave function

513
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,880
will only find xs

514
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,960
right but not on the side here it's not

515
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,150
cylindrically symmetric

516
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,340
so we got a new name for it that

517
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,320
it's pi function

518
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,290
we're going to call it pi two px or pi

519
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:20,520
two PY

520
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,340
OK it's going to be a binding weight function

521
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,650
and of course the binding function

522
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,460
if we look at energy level diagram

523
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:38,380
the pi two px and py two PY are going to be lower in energy

524
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,150
and the atomic wavefunctions just like this incident

525
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,190
the two px and two py y

526
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,250
in the atomic state

527
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,630
are the same energy

528
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,650
right the pi two px and py two PYP are going to be at the

529
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,570
same energy in the molecule

530
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:05,610
make sense

531
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,250
let's do more

532
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:14,460
four and so more unable get one p electron

533
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:20,570
it also has some s in s electrons right PS states are down here i

534
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,420
didn't draw them in and this diagram

535
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,800
i'm just reading right here that two px electron

536
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,420
what happens well what happens is we're going to fill each one of these states

537
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,440
with these electrons

538
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,210
now we're going to use

539
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,000
hunt's role again remember once rule

540
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:46,570
it says that when you have states that are degenerate

541
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,020
they have the same energy

542
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:54,380
the electrons such that one electron goes in each state

543
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:59,320
b four you can put a second electron in either one of those states

544
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,940
the way this algorithm works with you again begin with the nearest neighbour graph

545
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,480
what you do is

546
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,990
let x one to xn be the neighbours effects

547
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,320
you project next to the span of x one through x

548
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:22,570
and that projection you're calling x bar OK

549
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,760
so i have all my data

550
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,060
i made my nearest neighbour graph

551
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,360
for every data point i can look at its nearest neighbours and project the data

552
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,550
pointed to the span of the nearest neighbours

553
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,060
and then once i got the standard the nearest neighbours

554
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:44,520
and i've got x but i simply find barycentric coordinates of expire

555
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,330
which is basically finding a set of numbers that sum to one such that expires

556
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,610
the centre of mass

557
00:37:53,850 --> 00:38:00,550
and i represent bar in terms of this by centric coordinates

558
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,150
what i do is i construct sparse matrix w

559
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,120
but the i it through all of this

560
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:13,690
matrix is the battery centric four minutes of x i

561
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,860
in the basis of its nearest neighbour

562
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:22,650
OK and then they use the lowest eigenvectors of this

563
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,680
matrix to embed

564
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,660
so if you have already seen this probably but many of you may not have

565
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,560
an unjust

566
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:35,370
during these to give you a sense of what it is that people are trying

567
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:35,980
to do

568
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:41,690
at the turn of the century OK this is

569
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,270
from two thousand

570
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,120
and this is the intuition they had and they came up with these procedures and

571
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,680
for the most part you can't

572
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:58,530
prove things correct about these particular algorithms but you could ask are there other algorithms

573
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:06,690
that would do do meaningful things for the same general kind of a question

574
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:19,930
so is an argument for why the LLE is somehow computing in some sense the

575
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,330
last year

576
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,690
i don't want to go through this it's a little technical

577
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:29,230
but there is an argument in the parish

578
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:33,930
he showed that can i wrote actually shortly after this algorithm was published

579
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:40,570
in science which is giving some kind of a heuristic argument for whole LLE was

580
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,990
somehow calculating

581
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,740
the trace of the hessian which actually is the glacier

582
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:54,190
of maybe risk in the square of the laplacian

583
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,110
so then let me discuss the next algorithm which is the algorithm which is called

584
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,140
the plus in nineteen

585
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:05,850
and about le plus i can maps you can actually prove a few things

586
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:12,260
and it's related to a few other algorithms that have also been discussed later

587
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:16,100
so let me develop plus i maps algorithm

588
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:20,560
and the last in the map maps algorithm looks like this

589
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:23,110
you again build a nearest neighbour graph

590
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,430
so this is a graph

591
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,140
with every data point is identified with the vertex

592
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,810
and you put an edge between two data points

593
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:38,360
x is close to xj in some sense so you measure the euclidean distance between

594
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,810
x i and x j which is the only distance you can measure

595
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,480
and if it is less than epsilon you connect them

596
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,760
and as you build your nearest neighbour graph

597
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,230
you make this graph a weighted graph

598
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,360
so now i have a graph with n vertices i have ended up points have

599
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,660
a graph with n vertices each vertex is identified with the data point and w

600
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,990
i j the weight between

601
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:19,310
the i eight and the g eight vertex is given by that exponential functions

602
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,610
another general function is actually quite important because the correctness

603
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,700
of this algorithm will depend on actually the

604
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,860
functional form not

605
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:35,240
precisely in that function but on the decay of that function

606
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,560
so there is one parameter t here

607
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,430
that you see

608
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,260
if t is very small

609
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,930
it penalizes heavily if

610
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,930
the point six i annexed you far apart

611
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,330
and if t is very large it doesn't do that so it actually is in

612
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,190
forcing locality

613
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,100
so now what i've got is i've got n data points

614
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:05,550
i've built a graph with n vertices

615
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,350
and it's a weighted graph

616
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,330
where between the i th vertex and the g eight vertex i put the weight

617
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,570
w i j

618
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,400
it's symmetric

619
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,080
w w is a symmetric matrix

620
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,390
and notice

621
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,310
that actually in this setting that we are in its around matrix

622
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,530
because the way this matrix is generated is the following

623
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,760
i get a bunch of points randomly sampled from this manifold

624
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,870
x one x two x three x four x five and so on so i

625
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,320
get a random number of points each point on the manifold

626
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:42,760
got in points and now have generated an n by n matrix

627
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,480
which is a matrix

628
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,440
which looks like this

629
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,820
it's random matrix

630
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:53,860
so this particular matrix will have i can vectors and i can values

631
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:59,680
OK and then there the manifold and the central result which we will talk about

632
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,290
later after we just

633
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,970
intuitively understand this algorithm a little better

634
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,390
is that by looking at the spectrum of this matrix

635
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,640
and i can values and i can vectors

636
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:17,110
of this matrix essentially or something very closely related to this matrix

637
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,970
we can recover

638
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:23,770
dikin values and i can functions of the lab class beltrami operator of the manifold

639
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:27,510
from which the data was sampled

640
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,660
we make sense of that statement

641
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:41,290
the algorithm looks like this

642
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:43,390
you look at

643
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,050
matrix called the laplacian matrix

644
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,650
and that laplacian matrix is equal to the minus w

645
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:57,060
w is as i just defined it is symmetric matrix w i j is

646
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,350
what it is

647
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,580
with those exponentially weighted decay

648
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,620
is the diagonal matrix

649
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:11,940
we're DII is simply the rule sums of w i j overall j

650
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,100
so now i have this matrix l

651
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,070
it's actually immediate

652
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,690
that it is symmetric because d is a diagonal matrix and w is a symmetric

653
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:26,870
it also turns out to be positive semidefinite

654
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:38,390
which is not immediately obvious but it turns out to be true

655
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,100
and i can values and i eigenvectors of this matrix gives us

656
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,740
it is used for embedding

657
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:49,690
that's in the plaster nineteen maps

658
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,580
there's another

659
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,720
the distance metric

660
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:55,190
that was also proposed this is due to

661
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,940
the final form and rafi coifman

662
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:08,830
the diffusion distance and it's very closely related to this essentially

663
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,190
very very similar

664
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:14,010
so what you do

665
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,860
it is you think of

666
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,680
the heat diffusion operator on the manifold HD and we look at that a little

667
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,940
bit because the two main objects that's really we will need to

668
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:32,920
Omega matter of point three and I mentioned the power spectrum if we

669
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,330
look at the power spectrum of flow of fluctuations as a function of wave number

670
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:44,380
or momentum so this is large wave number or large momentum over here small distance

671
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:53,900
scales small wave number small momentum the infrared large distance scales here then what

672
00:45:53,900 --> 00:46:01,800
we would expect is a theoretical power spectrum that depends upon the value of Omega matter

673
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:08,920
times age because the peak in this power spectrum is sat by the wave number

674
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:16,560
associated with the equality of matter in radiation in the early universe and that depends

675
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:24,180
upon the something that's known as the shape parameter gamma which is very well approximated

676
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:30,570
by omega matter times age so just by looking at the power spectrum in fitting it

677
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:36,760
to a cold dark matter spectrum it gives us information about omega matter again

678
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:43,820
suggesting that Omega matter is point three or so so the observations of the total matter

679
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:49,340
density of the universe is about point three and we don't believe that baryons

680
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:55,620
can give that larger of a value there are two main reasons for

681
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:03,160
doing this for believing this actually three one reason comes from the calculations primordial or big

682
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:10,600
bang nucleosynthesis but of before admit it so after the bang the universe

683
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,720
was too hot for nuclei to exist and than about three minutes after the bang

684
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:23,000
the primordial protons and neutrons came together in form the light elements most of

685
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,060
the protons and neutrons formed helium for well most of the protons remained as hydrogen

686
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:38,520
the nuclei that will form will mostly helium for due to deuterium and helium three and

687
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,990
in order to make it through the first day the universe needed just a little bit

688
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,720
of lithium the abundance of lithium produced in the Big Bang is very small about

689
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:55,400
one part in ten of the ten to so the abundance of lithium produced in the Big Bang

690
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:02,320
is comparable to the abundance of benzene in Perrier ok so it's not a very

691
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:10,920
large fraction but just a little staste to improve it now the exact values of

692
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:17,660
hydrogen and helium and lithium depends upon the ratio the specific entropy of the universe

693
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:23,940
during nucleosynthesis which depends upon either either the ratio of baryons to the

694
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:30,370
photons since we know how many photo photon density is we can convert this

695
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:39,320
into omega b omega baryons times h squared and the observations are

696
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:44,640
consistent with Omega baryon H squared up about point zero two maybe a little

697
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:51,480
bit larger the best indication of the baryon density comes from

698
00:48:51,480 --> 00:49:01,800
measurements of deuterium deuterium is the most sensitive element to the baryon density and

699
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:07,420
there is not so easy today to make a measurement of deuterium abundance and deduce

700
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:13,600
its primordial abundance because the binding energy of deuterium is rather small two point two

701
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:19,340
emv it's easily destroyed are eaten by heavier elements so we want to know the

702
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:28,980
primordial abundances abundance of deuterium and that is best determined by looking at Lyman

703
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:36,920
alpha absorption systems at high redshift so a typical astronomer will look at a quasar

704
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,280
and on the line of sight of the quasars will be clouds that had not

705
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:49,060
yet formed galaxies and these clouds will absorb the radiation from the quasar a

706
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:55,260
very much in the Lyman alpha region so this would be the spectrum of look

707
00:49:55,270 --> 00:50:01,440
this particular quasar and there is an absorption feature here at a redshift of

708
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,080
three point five seven two so there's a Lyman alpha cloud at a distance corresponding to

709
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:12,660
a very large redshift looking back to the primordial universe and if you measure look

710
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:18,580
at a high dispersion spectrum of this a lot of this light from this quasar

711
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:24,240
what you see is that a Lyman alpha absorption due to the hydrogen and

712
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,940
you also see a feature here that's due to deuterium so here you can model

713
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:35,380
this and deduce the deuterium the hydrogen ratio and this is what corresponds to a

714
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:42,260
omega baryon h squared a point zero two since we determine that H squared

715
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:47,320
is one-half this is omega baryon a point zero four but the total Omega

716
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:54,400
in matter is point three so it's about ten per cent it`s not large enough

717
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,540
there's another reason to believe that baryons cannot be all of the matter

718
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:06,620
in the universe oh let me also mention that W map determines omega B H squared

719
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:13,080
from looking at the height of the acoustic oscillations peaks and their determination again is

720
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:20,660
consistent with a with a big bang nucleosynthesis value and it`s measured to very high accuracy so

721
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:30,500
omega baryon H squared is about point zero two if we look at what happens

722
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:36,020
to how you would form structure in the universe that only has baryons

723
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:45,000
baryons suffer in the early universe around the time of recombination a dissipation

724
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:54,840
known as collisional damping or silk damping so in this interesting region that happens between

725
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:01,200
the tightly coupled region for the first three hundred thousand years and decoupling

726
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:08,260
the photon mean free paths starts to become large and photons will start to drag baryons

727
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:19,220
around and will damp any baryon perturbations on small scales so the baryon photon fluid

728
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:25,020
suppers damped oscillations and let me show you a movie that I tried to show

729
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:32,380
the first lecture but I think is working now so what this is is a movie

730
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:37,500
that was made by Dean Eisenstein showing what would happen in the universe

731
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:45,820
if you start a hundred and ten years after the bang at a redshift of eighty two thousand five hundred and seven

732
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:51,140
this is when the universe becomes matter dominated so you start with a club a

733
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:56,010
finish this discussion by including the antibonding bonding orbital and this is the set free

734
00:52:56,010 --> 00:53:01,390
when you're drawing your molecular orbital diagrams any time you draw bonding orbital there is

735
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,990
also an antibonding orbital that exist

736
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:07,070
it might not have any electrons in it but it still exists so you need

737
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:11,880
to draw the interior molecular orbital diagram so i wanted to make sure you have

738
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:16,110
a complete that for hydrogen your notes so let's take a look at this hydrogen

739
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:19,890
we can first draw in our atomic electrons

740
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:23,410
so there's one electron in each hydrogen atom

741
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:28,420
and and this means will have a total of two electrons in hydrogen molecule

742
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,960
so we can fill both of those into the signal one s orbital the bonding

743
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,940
orbital we don't have to put anything into the antibonding orbital

744
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:41,500
so that's great what we've seen as we have in that lowering of energy of

745
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:46,750
the molecule versus the individual atoms

746
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:52,730
so let's try the electron configuration of hydrogen the molecules molecular hydrogen

747
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,040
what you saw

748
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:58,700
what we've done a lot of his drawing the electron configuration for different atoms we

749
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:03,000
can do the same thing for molecules so if we take h two

750
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,400
we want to draw the electron configuration it's very short

751
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,350
on is is think about

752
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,440
one has

753
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:14,350
and now we have two electrons in it so it sigma one square

754
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:18,530
so this is our electron configuration let's take a look at another example let's try

755
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:22,570
the molecular orbital diagram for h e to now

756
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,040
so again we can fill in our time

757
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:30,000
orbital here is going to be two electrons in each of our atomic orbitals

758
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,940
so now let's go ahead and fill molecular orbitals me to fill in a total

759
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,390
of four electrons

760
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:39,410
so we have two electrons in bonding orbital

761
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:42,720
but because we're we're using the same rules to follow up

762
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,670
molecular orbitals as we do atomic orbitals so

763
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:49,680
the poll exclusion principle tells us we can have more than two electrons per orbital

764
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,950
so we have to go up to our inside bonding orbital here

765
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,600
so this means that we have two electrons are lower in energy

766
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:00,170
but two are raised in energy

767
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:04,680
so with this BS stabilised molecule then

768
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,450
no so compared to the atoms it should be somewhat the same energy we shouldn't

769
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:13,000
get any extra stabilisation from forming the molecule

770
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,180
i select

771
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:22,220
go ahead and write with the electron configuration would be h e two

772
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,180
and again we're just filling in the different orbitals so we have to think about

773
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:27,330
one has

774
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,260
that's going to be square

775
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:34,140
and then we have sigma one as star where

776
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:41,540
so we can compare the two electron configuration and we can actually think about what

777
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:45,160
we figure out from the and we see that you are lower in energy to

778
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,450
electrons are raising energy so we have no net gain or no net loss of

779
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:52,430
energy for each e two

780
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,970
and there's actually way

781
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:59,180
that we can make predictions here and what use molecular orbital theory predicts that h

782
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:05,290
e two does not exist because it's not stabilised in terms of forming the molecule

783
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:08,970
the way that we can figure this out using something called bond order

784
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:14,050
bond order is the equal to one half times the number of bonding electrons minus

785
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:18,010
the number of antibonding electrons and the bond or you get out will either be

786
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:21,900
for example zero which would mean that you have no bond or you can have

787
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,520
one single bond one point five one-and-a-half bonds two

788
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:31,460
o double bond and so on so let's figure out the bond order for two

789
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:36,130
o two molecules here that we figured out the electron configuration for

790
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,760
so i guess we'll start with helium two

791
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:41,360
so the bond order

792
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,970
it's going to be equal to one half

793
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,840
and then it will be two minus two

794
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:50,730
so our bond order for eighty two is going to be equal to zero

795
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:54,790
so it has zero bond there's no bonding hg two

796
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,750
let's look for hydrogen

797
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:58,000
four hydrogen

798
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,460
bond order

799
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:02,450
it's going to be equal to one half

800
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,630
two minus zero

801
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:08,520
so we would predict bond order of one what kind of bond is a bond

802
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,200
order of one

803
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:14,280
i would expect to see a single bonded hydrogen

804
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:19,070
so what it actually turns out the reality is that eighty two does exist

805
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:23,520
but exist as the weakest chemical bond known and it wasn't in fact even found

806
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,360
to exist until nineteen ninety three so i can assure you this is not a

807
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,220
bond that you see very often in nature and it is the very very weak

808
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:37,680
bond it only had the dissociation energy of zero point one killer joules per mole

809
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,440
it means that if all these

810
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,640
our food

811
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,730
in order to

812
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:44,970
go here you have to spend a lot of energy

813
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:48,750
that's why you have something very stable

814
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:53,620
but now imagine that you have a lot of neutron excess neutron excess

815
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,930
how can you be sure that we have a similar scheme

816
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,290
so how can you be sure that these numbers will not change

817
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,020
disappear or change

818
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,780
or not

819
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:08,650
state so this is really a very important question now nowadays

820
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:13,730
are these magic number still valid for exotic nuclei

821
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:18,310
so this is an example that i give is concerning the ten equals twenty eight

822
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:19,790
magic number

823
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,260
so this is the magic and which is due to be not be care so

824
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,580
this in this line here so this is the number of neutrons

825
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,190
twenty eight is here

826
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,690
so is that the case is closed can

827
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:31,870
and then

828
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,080
you go down with the with the product number so you go to also for

829
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,910
thing him to reply here

830
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,010
so you see that experiment and we are far from the truth and that's the

831
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,160
decreasing here

832
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:47,410
so a proton number so this in the landscape

833
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:51,280
so neutrons here always the same

834
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,180
and protons here you see that

835
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:57,990
so i'm going to eight important so you have some problems on these articles

836
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,470
foster for sixteen so this is

837
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,540
and for some reason was in

838
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,680
so the question is how

839
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,500
occupancy of proto levels change

840
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:19,500
the schemes for neutron you had this problem neutron interaction so how the modification neutral

841
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:24,030
in and in practice on sorry in advance

842
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:29,060
when measurement is to calculate this energy difference

843
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,780
and then to see if you have the decrease of these gaps if you find

844
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:35,770
decreases means is no more magic numbers

845
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,860
so this is what has been done

846
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,900
two different approaches mean field engine with

847
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,810
and they both agree on the reduction of the shell gap anywhere twenty eight in

848
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:47,270
exotic nuclei

849
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:51,170
so for example here you have the energy so far calcium here

850
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:54,090
you have this difference which is equal to four

851
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,940
o point seven and

852
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:59,770
and here is reducing to three point five

853
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,540
the same year

854
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:06,650
position with between ten cm and since swing

855
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:09,260
but this is not an experimental fact

856
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,510
so this is only from very

857
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,980
and the difference between fragmentary figments

858
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:18,400
how big is it how do you know that it's no more magic numbers

859
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,600
so you need some observables

860
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:27,040
one possibility there are other spin on for example one possibility

861
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,090
it all looking

862
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:31,810
even even nuclei of the two process state

863
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,220
or what is the blue one

864
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,250
because as i told you in magic nuclei if you want to excite the nucleus

865
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,410
you have to spend a lot of energy

866
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:41,530
so it means

867
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:45,880
the the two personalities will be very high in these two play so we will

868
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,280
be very high energy

869
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,770
and it will be of

870
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:53,010
a single particle citations so so

871
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:59,350
not very collective so that's why we have very low transition probability to go from

872
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:03,780
the states of the ground state for to detail so that's why you are looking

873
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,630
at and is on the beach

874
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:07,390
you're expecting

875
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,810
the two president

876
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,980
deep into transition probabilities

877
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:14,630
so there are measurement that has been done

878
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:20,400
this is an example so you have the energy as the pentagon's the neutron

879
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,520
so first look at the density of ice at the picture

880
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:26,890
you it to from twenty twenty eight

881
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,310
so you have to magic numbers you

882
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:34,770
if you go from suffer so two separate unless you see that the peak is

883
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,720
let's here for twenty two

884
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:40,170
and for cities you don't see anything at all

885
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:42,150
so this is one proof

886
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:47,500
the other ones are we to sort transition probabilities of ground state depends on depending

887
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,310
on the neutron number

888
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:52,750
four clancy you have here decreases

889
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,190
and the idea is this

890
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,670
is that

891
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:59,920
more variables give more freedom more causes given more constraints

892
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:04,330
it had very few classes per variable the problem is it to satisfy properties many

893
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:06,730
solutions because it's underconstrained

894
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:11,980
if i have a large number of cores variable the problem is hard it's underconstrained

895
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,360
and the chances that can very quickly

896
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:17,380
discovering the problem is unsolvable

897
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,120
the hard region is one of these

898
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:23,210
have a particular racial where you really can tell if you're going to be able

899
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:25,830
to solve the problem and not and then you have to keep putting one more

900
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,210
work into it

901
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:31,060
and you know exactly what this ratio is depends on the number of problems but

902
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,040
for random three SAT problems

903
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,670
it's in around four points

904
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:39,690
and people are you know it trying to learn exactly what the number is

905
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:44,290
so the important thing for this is that most problems are easy

906
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:47,500
and that's actually going to be a great boon for us

907
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,710
OK so

908
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:53,560
how do we solve societal problems let's look at the back tracking approaches first

909
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:57,310
the basic idea in the backtracking approach is very simple as we're just going to

910
01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:00,850
assign truth values by depth first search

911
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:05,270
so i start out with no interest was signed and the necessary you know one

912
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:09,690
rote one variable and then to another then to another until i have to backtrack

913
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:14,060
and then you know i keep on doing this exploring the whole tree until i

914
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:15,750
find the solution

915
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:21,100
notice that when i assign a value sell to variable this has one of two

916
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:24,670
the false literals

917
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:28,880
i e the literals that become false by virtue of saying that variable i e

918
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,150
i that rewards

919
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:35,190
the negation depending on what signing

920
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:38,080
those essentially disappear

921
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:43,810
i like to think of a class in which the variable appears right if if

922
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:48,150
i have made the literal truth other clauses true

923
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:52,000
it had a five-minute rule false the little disappears

924
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,420
if i little through the clusters appears

925
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,650
so every time there is some about the variable i went up to the simpler

926
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:02,920
problem and so as i progress in my search the problem becomes simply to one

927
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,380
of two things happens

928
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,830
i i the wind up with an empty set of clauses which means that i

929
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:10,020
believe all of them so i succeeded

930
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,750
i went up with an empty clause

931
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:15,670
i mean that i made all the little and some clause false

932
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:18,190
therefore the cause false and i failed

933
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:21,330
and so what happens when i feel is that backtrack

934
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:25,350
i do some assignment that i just made and i might try again

935
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:29,350
and i keep on doing this until i succeed or to have exhausted the tree

936
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:30,580
and returned

937
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:35,040
so this is the basic idea there's a couple of additional improvements that we can

938
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,860
do that actually make a big difference

939
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,250
one of those is what's called unit propagation

940
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:45,730
and the propagation is that if you have have a unit clause meaning the just

941
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:47,650
one literal you know

942
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:52,170
what has to happen if i had the clause not a i know that has

943
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,520
to be false otherwise immediately the problem is not satisfied

944
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:00,150
OK so i think that i can before i search is active military unit clauses

945
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:02,290
and replace them by the artist

946
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:05,310
now you might think well gee how many units was are they going to be

947
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:07,380
my problem maybe not in

948
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,100
maybe not many but but the

949
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,460
the key thing is that as you replace

950
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,600
because there were links three become linked to

951
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,020
and then they become length one

952
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:22,830
so unit clauses crop up as as the search progresses so this one's up you

953
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,580
giving enormous time savings

954
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:29,790
given that we can use is what's called pure literals which is little just have

955
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,670
the same truth value everywhere

956
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:35,540
if they always appears nonnegative and i know that you know i was nothing by

957
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:41,290
sending it really true and certainly an organism that also again pure literals will appear

958
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:46,170
as the search progresses in the the CNF gets amplified in this will buy me

959
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:47,670
a lot of time savings

960
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:52,290
so here's the famous DPLL algorithm DPLL is short for the names of the people

961
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:56,350
who developed there this pattern and motion and loveland

962
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:59,790
and the way it works is just as follows it's a because procedure

963
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,540
if you seeing is empty

964
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,630
that means we delete all the causes of return true

965
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:08,650
else if CNF contains an empty clause then i feel they return false

966
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:14,040
else if it contains the true that i call DPLL again with the liberal replaced

967
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:18,120
by the necessary value else if it contains a unit clause i can just call

968
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:22,620
DPLL with the unit clauses you know the value of the two

969
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:27,130
they were replaced by the by the necessary about otherwise

970
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,750
i was saying there will

971
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:33,020
there is the CNF and you know choosing which variable is the heuristic process the

972
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:37,190
one that you know this is quite important and here's what do is

973
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:41,980
i call DPLL recursively with that are close to true

974
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,210
and if that succeeds then i'm done

975
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:47,920
otherwise i call it with the value of of the variables set false

976
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,060
OK so this is where things branch

977
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,730
and this is the killer that it can solve a lot of set aside problems

978
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:55,880
very fast

979
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,790
not nearly as fast as stochastic local search for a lot of problems

980
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,980
so there's many problems like for example you know something as simple as queensland DPLL

981
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,060
is quite slow

982
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,060
and stochastic local search is just blindingly fast

983
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:13,360
so the stochastic local search words it's it's the more recent of these types of

984
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:16,270
methods but it's one that goes to the largest problems

985
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:20,060
in stochastic local search what i have in each point in the search is it

986
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:23,420
complete assignment of values to the variables

987
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:29,170
so that tracking works with partial assignments stochastic local search works with complete assignments

988
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,770
and then what i do is

989
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:42,130
to do years

990
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,530
the energy needed

991
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:08,260
dpq equals zero implies people's skills

992
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:11,450
maybe that's better

993
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:15,880
of the problems you want to solve this finding

994
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:20,610
the k nearest neighbours at some points for the epsilon nearest neighbours at some point

995
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:23,650
or something like

996
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:27,270
these are the places where kind of technology can be useful

997
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:30,000
first of all the k nearest neighbours sort of the

998
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:32,150
most current learning

999
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,450
it often works

1000
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:36,190
surprisingly well in practice

1001
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,150
i wish

1002
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:41,160
should be or if you have two metric

1003
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:44,540
to the problem

1004
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:48,580
it's useful simulation if you a set of particles which are running around

1005
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:52,380
if you want to think about the metric is being the euclidean distance divided by

1006
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,580
the sum of the velocities

1007
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:56,670
that actually this magic

1008
01:08:57,490 --> 01:09:01,300
and then you that gives you a lot of time to find the nearest neighbour

1009
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,990
search means first things could

1010
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,300
and then you can do the interaction and you can just keep on

1011
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,810
finding the next year's neighbours

1012
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:11,430
it's also useful in

1013
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,480
the networks were

1014
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:19,110
want to design a network which will find some files with a latency so the

1015
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:20,870
notion of a neighborhood in terms of

1016
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,690
this the thing latency

1017
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:31,590
so this is the basic problem

1018
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:32,990
some bad news

1019
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:36,920
can do better and brute force

1020
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:40,100
in force

1021
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,390
maybe you need to

1022
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:45,810
elements into RAM

1023
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:49,460
in the context of in space into

1024
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:53,150
and then querying you can just for every single point

1025
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,170
you can get distance to the query

1026
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:59,080
and finding

1027
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:01,530
it turns out can do any better norsk case

1028
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,050
just because you can get

1029
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:04,960
so there are

1030
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:09,130
most people who don't problems and i'm somewhat unfair

1031
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:10,280
comparing them

1032
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:14,420
but i think it's illustrative so is this

1033
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:17,270
the rule and stop in two thousand two

1034
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:22,730
the algorithm which was took over m squared times november twenty space

1035
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:26,390
and integration of

1036
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:30,870
and then there was this navigating that which is it that two thousand four

1037
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:32,900
which is essentially the same

1038
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:36,530
there are ball trees which are

1039
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,920
what you can the

1040
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:41,700
the thing which people use alot right now

1041
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:45,610
and then they actually work very well in practice

1042
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:47,090
but the worst case

1043
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:52,780
there are m squared time and in space

1044
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,790
and then cover tree talk about here which can have the same

1045
01:10:56,810 --> 01:11:01,720
o worst-case asymptotic testable tree

1046
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:05,590
the things she

1047
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:07,860
that's right so

1048
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:14,500
these are algorithms just rely on just having a metric kd trees rely upon the

1049
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:18,240
euclidean space so are some some sort of

1050
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,910
axis aligned space

1051
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:26,420
OK to pretty well when you have this low dimensional euclidean space in high dimensional

1052
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,840
euclidean space

1053
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:31,670
often these techniques in the parking lot better

1054
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:35,890
and you know these things are not too much solar thank motorists

1055
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:39,050
the cover trees is will not be too much so kd trees all those experiments

1056
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:42,620
have not been done yet

1057
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:46,010
what do we need to constrain the URL

1058
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:49,170
exactly so that you

1059
01:11:49,190 --> 01:11:51,040
i always find the

1060
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:54,000
the closest neighbors the

1061
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:57,880
the first thing is

1062
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,150
all of these

1063
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,230
it is artificial

1064
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:05,370
the support approximate queries reasoning

1065
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:09,730
there are some other approaches for doing approximate

1066
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:14,500
my question in general is that you should go for exact

1067
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:18,000
and then if you discover that too computationally burdensome if you go for approximate

1068
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:24,920
OK so

1069
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:30,130
why is it so so

1070
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,230
this for

1071
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,630
well know there

1072
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,220
now it it's

1073
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:42,290
what was going to happen fundamentally thrown extra assumptions

1074
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:46,740
four and say i did so in the worst case we can do better than

1075
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:48,290
brute force

1076
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,950
but to be one of the worst case

1077
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:53,070
and it has some structure

1078
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,490
and given that structure we can do better

1079
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:01,150
so we define the structure is and how you can do better next

1080
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,210
OK so

1081
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:09,100
what structure so this is actually find the current rule

1082
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,550
if you have

1083
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,350
a ball of radius r one the point

1084
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:17,800
the set of points in the set

1085
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:18,980
which is

1086
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,810
these services are

1087
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,710
there's p

1088
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:24,180
these are

1089
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:26,640
if you double the radius

1090
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:28,800
company new set of points

1091
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,910
and the divide the set of points in a small ball

1092
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:32,930
call that

1093
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:39,200
take the worst case over all points and all races

1094
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:43,020
thank all the worst case the expansion constant

1095
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:48,010
so this expansion constant is sort of like to do it dimension

1096
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:55,550
so if you had kind of a regular grid of points

1097
01:13:55,560 --> 01:14:04,510
would be about four che

1098
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:08,510
period points in three-dimensional space to be about a dish

1099
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:13,320
now there's a few things in notice about this notion of structure

1100
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:16,780
one is that

1101
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:21,420
it doesn't obey which you might think of dimensionality sometimes so for example if you

1102
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:23,200
have the set of points

1103
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:28,430
you can list

1104
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,110
you can have this can be p

1105
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,770
this can be are

1106
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:36,100
and then we double it

1107
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:38,680
include all of these points here

1108
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:43,460
between the expected cost can be very large

1109
01:14:44,210 --> 01:14:46,760
it is

1110
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,010
some other way

1111
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:56,060
different dimensionality

1112
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:59,970
maybe even closer to fractal dimension

1113
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,750
which is

1114
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:04,890
you have a larger radius

1115
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:09,060
yes so how many balls of the small radius and you necessarily cover all the

1116
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:12,160
elements of large areas

1117
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:15,250
but we're not going to use that one because

1118
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:19,100
we can prove very much respected

1119
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:22,960
there's to be here and to thank the organisers for for inviting me

1120
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:24,900
particularly since

1121
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:30,820
and that for so being kind of very close to the competition learning theory community

1122
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,630
although had so connections are

1123
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,370
i know that the stuff i'm going to talk about today

1124
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:40,100
is things were learning theory

1125
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:42,930
is a difficult to apply to and

1126
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:46,510
i'd like to present this as a challenge for for the community

1127
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,090
to to study it

1128
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:53,050
so that was about learning representations or a deep learning as a come to be

1129
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:56,630
known you can think of deep learning is one particular way of learning representations

1130
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:01,530
so we know that at in the history of pattern recognition and machine learning we've

1131
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:07,530
or you could good job that are coming up with algorithms to learn classifiers predictors of various kinds

1132
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,930
always assuming that either the feature set or the

1133
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:12,790
kernel was given to us

1134
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:21,520
that the kind of questions i'd been interested in for very long time before

1135
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:22,100
you know

1136
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:24,720
before you from the first act a

1137
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,060
set of working on machine learning which was in the early eighties

1138
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:31,910
was learning representations because i think it was

1139
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:36,960
some from the start that it was kind of the secret to words more powerful learning machines

1140
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:41,340
so that's why i have never had a huge interest with things like kernel methods stuff

1141
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,680
like that because they just were not solving problems

1142
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:44,810
i was interested in

1143
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:46,940
that doesn't mean that i think useful

1144
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:49,730
but i think

1145
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:53,930
my my interest just elsewhere so here is where the interest is it's

1146
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:58,770
learning learning representations and

1147
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:00,540
learning representations

1148
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:05,060
i think is is probably the next step for for ai machine learning

1149
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,450
as well as for things like nor science cognitive science

1150
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,220
neuroscientists have no idea how the brain learns representations

1151
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:15,190
and i think machine learning to help them with that

1152
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:20,130
so how do we learn representations of the of the of the world say the visual or

1153
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:21,700
perceptual world

1154
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:26,920
and by by merely looking at the world maybe acting on it as well

1155
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:34,450
neuroscientists as themselves a similar question how does the visual cortex organized itself to perceive

1156
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:35,250
you know to

1157
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:38,570
turn itself into a visual cortex f

1158
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,240
the the sort of connected question or for machine learning would be how do we

1159
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,450
know feature hierarchies

1160
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:49,680
reason for hierarchy is is going to conclusion of interest to a couple minutes

1161
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,010
so deep learning problem really is the one of

1162
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,380
is one of

1163
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:56,590
you know learning

1164
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:59,640
representations of the world just looking at data

1165
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:06,140
as we'll know

1166
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:13,070
a pattern recognition system have been built by either building handcrafted feature extractors followed

1167
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:15,050
by you know classifiers

1168
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:20,370
although the more modern approach to things like object recognition speech recognition

1169
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,800
actually has another stage in

1170
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:24,940
in the middle here the little features effects

1171
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:29,820
in the case of speech are things like this disease in the case of vision of things like sift hard

1172
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,860
and the second level

1173
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:33,530
i'm actually uses learning

1174
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:37,000
it it's based on some sort of unsupervised learning

1175
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:39,090
very simple one k-means sparse coding

1176
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:44,630
to sort of turn the low level representations into sort of mid level representations could call it this way

1177
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:49,550
and that is followed by some sort pooling and and then classifier supervised classifier

1178
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:54,760
so you know one more stage fixed unsupervised learning supervised training

1179
01:18:55,090 --> 01:19:00,060
that's kind of the mainstream approach to speech and and image recognition

1180
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:01,410
until the recently

1181
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:09,470
but really that model hasn't changed much since the early days of pattern recognition when

1182
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:12,450
you look at the perceptron that's pretty much what it is you know feature extraction

1183
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:14,700
globalized sort of classifier

1184
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:22,290
you know maybe it's time after fifty years fifty five years so to

1185
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:23,770
move away from the model

1186
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:26,100
if we look at f

1187
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,870
how are the brain performs vision

1188
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:32,660
and another huge advocates advocates for you know

1189
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:35,730
inspired by biology but

1190
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:38,350
but sometimes useful to give intuitions from it

1191
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,790
is much more hierarchical we have kind of a

1192
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:44,160
for the sort of fast recognition process

1193
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:48,420
that people performance and you know animals as well

1194
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:54,260
this sort of a feedforward path that we can trace the eventual pathway the cortex

1195
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,010
the cortex

1196
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:57,600
that goes into several stages each of which has

1197
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:00,650
you know very highly non-linear operations

1198
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:09,160
and goes through you know very areas of the brain v1 due to the for fiji each of which

1199
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:12,090
has several layers processing if you want

1200
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:18,210
so you might have to a single had to go through maybe ten synapses something like this or ten

1201
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:19,820
or neurons if you want

1202
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,110
to go to the

1203
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,620
an area of the brain where object categories are encoded

1204
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:27,140
so it's not just

1205
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,530
it's not shadow in the sand in the usual sense

1206
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:32,780
it doesn't look very much like kind of architecture review so far

1207
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:39,110
ok so it's sometimes useful to get a little bit inspiration from biology but is also very generous

1208
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:45,610
because we don't know what's important where we look at a piece of brain i don't know what matters in it

1209
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:51,170
and so here is an example of what not to do this guy called down from the

1210
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:52,080
nineteenth century

1211
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:55,310
who builds are airplanes model to bats and

1212
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:59,710
you know you know much aerodynamics he was very good at building or steam engines

1213
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:05,060
but powerful like steam engines but not very good at like you know stability and things like this

1214
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:07,800
and to build a second full size thing actually took off

1215
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:10,940
you know through fifty meters one meter

1216
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,880
was completely uncontrollable which is why you probably never heard

1217
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:22,940
a function of course was about a but yeah but but not on

1218
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:27,040
the other on some points the wright brothers this thirty years before the wright brothers

1219
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,850
so you know he got

1220
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:33,150
used to close biology you really know important about it

1221
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:39,290
he had to figure out you know a lot of a dynamic instability

1222
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:43,640
we might as the question you know not phase there are people in the world we

1223
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:45,590
got lots of money from

1224
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:49,760
a very governments who claimed that we can put use the

1225
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:55,190
functions of the human brain by basically simulating giant brain on a computer

1226
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:59,980
and i think it's completely nuts i think it's just you know it can't possibly

1227
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:02,180
work if we don't understand the underlying principles are

1228
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:04,640
so what are the underlying principles intelligence

1229
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:10,760
what is the equivalent their dynamics of their dynamics intelligence right that's that's what are

1230
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:12,040
we might want to go after

1231
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,830
in terms of some conceptual

1232
01:22:16,570 --> 01:22:17,650
ok so

1233
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:22,960
architecture we might want to go after something of this type where you know if the raw input

1234
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:27,190
and we have to go through a whole bunch of transformations each of which is kind of

1235
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,180
train all machine oil

1236
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:32,670
and and as as a

1237
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:35,990
as a side effect of this whole system training

1238
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:39,080
itself to perform the task world can have

1239
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,400
drive each of representations of the problem

1240
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:44,660
so the first if you're theorists

1241
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:51,110
at some theory i know first question to ask is why we need many layers of wind energy can we just

1242
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:53,300
do this just to layers like say this

1243
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:56,210
ok have a kernel function compare your input with earlier

1244
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,150
training examples or a subset of them are

1245
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,370
computer linear combination of this new dot

1246
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:04,040
now also of course you know someone has to give you this kind of function which is just

1247
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:06,080
as complicated is coming up with a feature vector

1248
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:12,180
the you know if you limit the complexity of this function here

1249
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:16,340
it's pretty clear that there is a whole bunch of functions that require very very large number

1254
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:44,430
this the weekend is over for now and 3 0 9 1 so the announcement

1255
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:51,920
this Wednesday that we know lecture instead celebration of learning

1256
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:53,860
test number 2

1257
01:23:55,690 --> 01:23:57,500
these are the

1258
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:01,650
room assignments we had moved them just a little bit

1259
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:06,600
I move the dividing lines rather than the same rules that we wanted to make

1260
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,220
a little more room in here

1261
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:13,610
and in the locker genome so there's of more people are being asked to go

1262
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:16,750
to 1 dash 190

1263
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:20,400
and this is the group to go to the Walker Jimmy 3rd floor of the

1264
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:26,900
Walker Memorial Building and then the front half of the alphabet group reported here

1265
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:34,510
and if you take the test at 1 o'clock don't go 6 120 because we

1266
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:40,150
will be there were putting everybody 26 100 that where there are plenty of vacancies

1267
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:44,340
so it's good so I'm just gonna go quickly over the the

1268
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:47,840
the comments that I give before every test is to put everybody in the right

1269
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:55,680
frame of mind but the coverage is lecture 7 317 possible start with ionic go

1270
01:24:55,730 --> 01:25:02,730
through the generation of x-rays but not rags or anything like that long

1271
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:08,250
so remember you better bring 5 things with you periodic table table constant something to

1272
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:12,890
write with a calculator and you're AG

1273
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:19,750
you know unmakeable suggestions for some of you want to write your recitation instructors name

1274
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:23,610
on your AG because I want to tell you what I wanna do if I

1275
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:28,560
don't have a recitation instructors name on the exam I'm not gonna greater

1276
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:33,370
you know why I guess 630 these if you don't put the recitation instructors name

1277
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:37,100
on the exam that means you're no hurry to get it back and that'll save

1278
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:41,900
me time we'll just take all just putting aside greater the ones for the people

1279
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:44,940
who really want to get back the next day and I'll get around to the

1280
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:45,870
other ones

1281
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:51,720
so well

1282
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:55,780
I think after the after 2 months it's not unreasonable for us to expect you

1283
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:01,430
put the recitation structures name only an example on the purpose of the test is

1284
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:07,100
to provide you with feedback so we want to just tell you are you mastering

1285
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,460
the material you

1286
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:13,810
is your study habits are your study habits effective enough so we're trying to do

1287
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:18,370
so this is not an aptitude tests on emissions tests I just wanna see if

1288
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:21,810
your mastering the material if you are going to say congratulations keep up the good

1289
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:25,050
work and if you're not going to send a message saying you keep up at

1290
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:29,370
this level you fail the class you need to get that information on a timely

1291
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:38,650
1 of this test taking strategies read the paper 1st identified easy questions work on

1292
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:43,590
your schedule don't do number 1 because I made a number 1 number 1 only

1293
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:48,180
because it's the easiest 1 for you to be confidence-building the nerves

1294
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:51,710
and so on show your work show your work

1295
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:54,600
all right cryptic answers because as you get wrong

1296
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,990
we can give you part

1297
01:26:57,940 --> 01:26:59,000
if you give us lots of

1298
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:06,070
binomial volumes of information to give us a few ideas as to how you are

1299
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:11,370
approaching the problem that we can give you partial credit for parametrically try not to

1300
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:13,610
immediately start going through your calculator

1301
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:19,600
and then please bring something to compute with I was astonished in the 1st half

1302
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:23,770
the number of people that had no calculator a

1303
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:25,210
the course was

1304
01:27:26,190 --> 01:27:28,190
any line because like that will do

1305
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:32,420
i think that's easy case where we can

1306
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:40,810
can divide this too

1307
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:45,380
can a linear function approximator

1308
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:49,430
or contain a line

1309
01:27:57,580 --> 01:28:02,840
the classes from years

1310
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:05,540
obviously it's for questions

1311
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:09,300
the answer is no

1312
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:14,800
but could change the feature space so the answer would be yes

1313
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:17,500
you could change the feature space two

1314
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:18,720
x squared

1315
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:22,570
what's where x one night six y

1316
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:26,470
not just w one times x plus w two times y

1317
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:27,840
but instead

1318
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:31,950
w one times x squared plus w two times x y

1319
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:36,800
plus w three times y squared again you know these are still linear in the

1320
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,850
the weights price there are sort of item here

1321
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,170
still linear in the weights

1322
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:49,790
but with these equations highway these equations i can build

1323
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:51,570
a linear function

1324
01:28:52,350 --> 01:28:53,960
linear function of these

1325
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:55,850
draw the circle

1326
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:57,640
in the x y space

1327
01:28:57,650 --> 01:29:02,270
so the point is that people are an impression that live buccaneers are are are

1328
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:03,600
extremely limited

1329
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:04,980
that's not true

1330
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:09,230
it is only the latest of expanded feature space knots x and y but any

1331
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:14,000
any features that you could use that would still give you and your partner

1332
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:21,350
and this is why the function approximation so popular that it is quite powerful

1333
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:34,150
but it was so here's the deal most time

1334
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:38,310
opposition with linear function approximation is convex being is one global optima and you can

1335
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:43,060
with many fascination there are often local optima

1336
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,220
OK so

1337
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:47,450
you can find a decent solution maybe but you want you don't get to unify

1338
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:49,280
the globally best solution

1339
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:51,400
so so

1340
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:55,420
neural nets used for take this sort of form

1341
01:29:55,570 --> 01:30:01,220
this slide slight slightly modified and know that do have the problem of running into

1342
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:05,140
local optima however there are many tricks that you can use neural nets to avoid

1343
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:06,350
local optima

1344
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:10,350
so just go that look look what mothers that mean that you can use them

1345
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:11,670
work in practice

1346
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:14,450
but it is one kind you

1347
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:17,120
carry out an unknown knowledge method everywhere

1348
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:33,750
well you easily the that's that's the problem it's just that the if you do

1349
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:35,930
gradient descent

1350
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,290
or right

1351
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:39,630
radio said

1352
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,000
and for space

1353
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,120
you know

1354
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:43,410
you end up

1355
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:52,010
OK you're saying you're saying this non-linear case is actually convex

1356
01:30:52,150 --> 01:30:59,950
OK i would disagree

1357
01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:08,190
the thing in general and non linear function approximation OK that's that's example

1358
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:16,170
but we got some white function posterior you can always take the gradient with respect

1359
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:17,440
to the parameters

1360
01:31:17,450 --> 01:31:21,720
of that function

1361
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:24,050
OK and all need to do

1362
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,160
it up with the previous methods two

1363
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:29,590
are defunct approximation is to be able to great is to be able to do

1364
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,810
gradient descent

1365
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:35,630
OK if you forget get fish around gravesend or it's very simple you about the

1366
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:40,690
about function that you want to minimize maximize

1367
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,770
in this case we assume that we want to

1368
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:48,570
i actually suspect that

1369
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:51,780
other points

1370
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:57,430
so this is very functions back to every parameter individually

1371
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,130
you get a vector gradients

1372
01:31:59,140 --> 01:31:59,820
this area

1373
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:04,050
back to partial derivatives which is the gradient

1374
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:08,460
OK so it in two d problem you might have this sort of ball

1375
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:14,160
and you you want to find the minimum of this poll

1376
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,190
actually i guess

1377
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:18,790
i guess this will persist for the maximum

1378
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,480
this here the gradient shows that

1379
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:24,620
yeah have character right

1380
01:32:24,630 --> 01:32:28,540
so no need to the gradient is interactive increase

1381
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:34,080
looks like and if you it's the minimum here then you go in the opposite

1382
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,380
direction negative

1383
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:37,930
the fraction of the gradient

1384
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:43,780
so if you want to minimize a function take its gradient take some small step

1385
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:48,770
in the negative direction of the gradient and the problem is convex

1386
01:32:48,810 --> 01:32:50,550
say like ball

1387
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,820
you will always be able to find the minimum

1388
01:32:57,570 --> 01:33:02,320
so now let's look green green separate for reverse learning we're going use the mean

1389
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:06,510
squared error as our error measure we will take if we want to minimize their

1390
01:33:06,510 --> 01:33:10,430
function we want to follow the gradient of error function with respect to the parameters

1391
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:17,140
so the air itself are called the airtime t our them the teeth episode update

1392
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:19,720
as delta t

1393
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:28,080
so let's look at

1394
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:32,370
i i i i don't care what the is here vt some sample could be

1395
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:33,170
the sample

1396
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:36,690
one step back up it can be the simple monte carlo back all i care

1397
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:38,480
is that it is some estimates

1398
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:44,880
of the value in trying to predict disimsample that's what i'm trying to predict

1399
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:47,070
so i

1400
01:33:47,150 --> 01:33:52,550
second style not that no no it's not on the slide

1401
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:54,620
so the

1402
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:59,070
could be a linear right from approximation in which case

1403
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:05,960
again this some sample it's all i care to be multicolour the care i got

1404
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:10,970
OK now let's take a linear approximation summer of i

1405
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,200
one to k

1406
01:34:13,330 --> 01:34:16,800
they die times

1407
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:19,620
agonizing up here so he

1408
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,210
love let's see the approximation

1409
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:29,030
OK if you want to the actions exist

1410
01:34:29,090 --> 01:34:31,180
at this as well

1411
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:33,090
so this is my

1412
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:38,160
levi approximations by kernel parameters state i is is the estimate the guy

1413
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:41,300
this is the area between like by sample estimate

1414
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:42,730
my current

1415
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:45,090
i was under the population

1416
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:48,350
now let's take the derivative

1417
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:52,120
the error square

1418
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:54,500
with respect to

1419
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:57,580
some parameter theta i

1420
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:04,150
let's try to square

1421
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:06,390
the idea is to

1422
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,650
OK a little bit about distances

1423
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:16,310
because they will keep beekeeping top again and again and discuss the structure information and

1424
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:22,400
across america background so let me remind you that you can find the lectures on

1425
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,470
that website

1426
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:29,040
so you remember where we left off last classes with the slight like this

1427
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:34,540
where where we went back to the freeman equation and we did some manipulation two

1428
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:37,490
variety in this form

1429
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:42,670
where this is now generally not for our universe that there's only a single component

1430
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:47,140
but with the universe has got several different components radiation

1431
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:51,520
mark this court about two and cosmological constant

1432
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:53,990
and so

1433
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:57,880
there are two things that one can learn from this equation

1434
01:35:57,890 --> 01:36:01,590
which is nothing about this simple thing that we derive the friedmann equations but just

1435
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:03,600
recreated in different form

1436
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:08,770
it's one thing is that we've introduced these my god here

1437
01:36:08,790 --> 01:36:12,530
and these omega are cosmological parameters

1438
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:18,820
so these describe the density of radiation today in terms of the critical density remember

1439
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:23,680
the critical density is the amount of stuff that makes the geometry of the universe

1440
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:29,740
is flat this is the same parameter format so in here you can have

1441
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,420
called our mother and you can have very ionic matter for what these kind of

1442
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:40,090
equation is concerned there's not much difference because on very large scales by audience will

1443
01:36:40,090 --> 01:36:43,850
behave like martyr small-scale of things have different

1444
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:51,920
cosmological constant curvature so we've introduced cosmological parameters and for the past fifteen years the

1445
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:56,980
name of the game in cosmology was actually to determine the cosmological parameters

1446
01:36:56,990 --> 01:37:01,570
we can already have a clue of where some of the information may be coming

1447
01:37:01,570 --> 01:37:05,890
from if you measure this function is that you can get some handle on the

1448
01:37:05,890 --> 01:37:07,560
component of the universe

1449
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:11,540
and the other thing that you can learn from this equation is that if you

1450
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:17,030
have a mix of components radiation marked the curvature of cosmological constant in some of

1451
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:21,370
them you can put them zero depending on your choice of more chances are that

1452
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:26,810
at different times in the life of the universe you know the scale factor changes

1453
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:30,090
a different components dominic

1454
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:33,640
because the scale different is a function of the scale factors

1455
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:38,900
so for example if you normalizing because it's a it's customary to normalise so that

1456
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:41,080
the scale factor is unity today

1457
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:44,280
and it becomes smaller and smaller and smaller in the past

1458
01:37:44,310 --> 01:37:48,340
you can already see that if you go back enough in time the asian will

1459
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:52,830
and then at some point master will dominate

1460
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:57,150
but then you can see that as you go in the future then what will

1461
01:37:57,150 --> 01:38:03,400
dominate eventually if you have some cosmological constant the cosmological constant that

1462
01:38:04,370 --> 01:38:08,990
so that was my motivation for going first of the exercise of let's see what

1463
01:38:08,990 --> 01:38:12,740
happens for a single component universe because at different time in the life of the

1464
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:17,650
universe different component dominates the so for that period you can describe the evolution of

1465
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:22,430
the universe like if he was if there was only one component

1466
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:27,190
if you have

1467
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:31,270
for some simple cases if you ever muttering curvature only

1468
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,810
then what happen is that the density

1469
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,270
is that death a destiny

1470
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:42,390
in other words it is possible evolution of the universe from the big bang down

1471
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,180
to the the future and so

1472
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:51,390
depending on the geometry you choose remember the geometry if you have no cosmological constant

1473
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:58,400
is just given by the content then if you have something that is more than

1474
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:05,830
critical then it's includes universe and eventually stop expanding eventually turns around collapses on itself

1475
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:07,660
big bang and big crunch

1476
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:13,090
not much fun to see that if you have a universe that is less than

1477
01:39:13,090 --> 01:39:16,960
critical then you have an open geometry and if it's less than critical means that

1478
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:20,910
you don't have enough money to actually stop this initial this function so it will

1479
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:25,570
continue to expand forever and there is the limiting case in between these two

1480
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:27,480
it is a case where you know

1481
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:32,390
you never collapses in another keep expanding so eventually at infinity will stop it is

1482
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:36,950
that infinity will not stop so this is the limiting case between the two and

1483
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:38,420
this is the flat jam

1484
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:42,640
OK so this is some nice and clear if

1485
01:39:42,650 --> 01:39:46,520
you have much include but because density

1486
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:47,380
you know

1487
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:52,830
rhapsody or the whole the whole distribution sums up let's say seven hundred thousand different

1488
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:57,720
songs a typical walmart store can get carry about thirty thousand of them

1489
01:39:57,770 --> 01:40:02,460
and and this you know this this part here gives you twenty two percent of

1490
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:03,790
the whole distribution

1491
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:08,010
similarly you can ask for books so for example you can take lot of noble

1492
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:09,820
like big story

1493
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:12,660
which gets around one hundred fifty thousand books

1494
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:16,650
you know on amazon you can you can be selling in the millions of books

1495
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:21,560
and so amazon is about selling about two point three million books book book titles

1496
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:25,070
and now we can ask okay how and you can assume that you know what

1497
01:40:25,070 --> 01:40:29,410
is nobody selling hundred thirty thousand most popular books and you can ask how many

1498
01:40:29,410 --> 01:40:33,220
how much sales that these popular books and it turns out that they give you

1499
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:37,500
less than half of the same so all this sort of you know

1500
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:42,550
popular titles they idea and you have a lot of

1501
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:44,180
the sense what

1502
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:47,420
and similarly for movies basically so

1503
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:49,260
this is just the idea to show that

1504
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:53,020
in this tale even though these things are very rare but because there's a lot

1505
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:53,690
of them

1506
01:40:53,730 --> 01:40:57,880
there is also a significant portion of the of the probability mass in the tail

1507
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:59,140
of the distribution

1508
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:00,870
sort of much more

1509
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,460
and what we user to from like experience with gaussian distributions

1510
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:08,400
so the question

1511
01:41:08,410 --> 01:41:11,030
when i was talking about degree exponents

1512
01:41:11,130 --> 01:41:15,050
the question is what is the degree exponent and it turns out that

1513
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:16,770
very different networks

1514
01:41:16,810 --> 01:41:21,570
all have this heavy tailed degree distributions and here are the estimates for the degree

1515
01:41:21,570 --> 01:41:26,310
exponent usually it's somewhere between two and three so for example for the web graph

1516
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:29,490
the graph is that that so we have the degree and out degree exponents there

1517
01:41:29,490 --> 01:41:32,140
are between two point one and two point four

1518
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:35,430
autonomous systems this is internet just like to point four

1519
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:40,320
actor collaborations this is basically a data from IMDB is about to point three

1520
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:43,840
citation networks have the exponent around three

1521
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:47,190
online social networks have it around two

1522
01:41:47,210 --> 01:41:52,040
and this this graph here shows you the degree distribution for

1523
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:57,740
i think like one billion web page sample from the beastie in

1524
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,780
nineteen in two thousand or something like that and you can see some of these

1525
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:01,840
heavy tails

1526
01:42:01,910 --> 01:42:05,640
some funny funny things going on

1527
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:10,950
so what i want to ask now is if i if i see a heavy

1528
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:13,980
tailed distribution like that how the estimate the slope

1529
01:42:13,990 --> 01:42:16,380
and before i do this

1530
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:20,330
let me sort of show another little example why these

1531
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:25,420
power law distributions of the solutions that have this particular form of fun it turns

1532
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:31,010
out that for example if if you're exponent is less than two then your expectation

1533
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:35,030
i won't exist so you're you're mean will increase with the number of samples from

1534
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:38,800
the distribution rights so the more samples you get the higher the average which is

1535
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:43,240
kind of funny right so we have a distribution of has infinitely similarly if you

1536
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:44,690
ask for many years

1537
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:50,080
distributions power law distributions with exponent less than three we have infinite variance

1538
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:52,320
so these are very different from

1539
01:42:52,370 --> 01:42:57,670
normal girls institutions or whatever but to to go and ask how how can i

1540
01:42:57,670 --> 01:43:01,580
estimate the power law exponent from the data so that are like few different ways

1541
01:43:01,580 --> 01:43:06,080
so what should people have have done is to feed the line sort of using

1542
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:09,390
least squares plot the data on log log scales and fit the line

1543
01:43:09,410 --> 01:43:10,140
right so

1544
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:14,810
just you know do not least squares least squares regression on log log axis

1545
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,680
this is a really bad

1546
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:18,240
and i'll show you why

1547
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:23,040
what works better is to you know you can feed line but instead of on

1548
01:43:23,070 --> 01:43:28,320
the pdf you do it on a ccdf so are complementary cumulative distribution function so

1549
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,980
you're plotting probability

1550
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:34,370
that or the number of the number of or fraction of observations that have developed

1551
01:43:34,370 --> 01:43:36,680
that have value greater than some x

1552
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:40,700
and then what you can show is that if this

1553
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:43,100
on log log axis this has some slope

1554
01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:47,730
then if you would be plotting pdf the slope is one plus the slope of

1555
01:43:47,730 --> 01:43:48,940
the CCD

1556
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:56,000
and then the last thing is you can use MLE

1557
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:59,250
right you can you can plug

1558
01:43:59,260 --> 01:44:03,980
plug in your data points in cake greater value of this formulae and you get

1559
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:07,580
the exponent what is sort of the key here is that you have to decide

1560
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:11,190
where does your distribution start to follow a power law right so in a sense

1561
01:44:11,190 --> 01:44:13,650
you have to decide from which acts on

1562
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:14,500
there is this

1563
01:44:14,570 --> 01:44:16,350
heavy tailed of power law

1564
01:44:16,370 --> 01:44:18,700
and that's a very good papers

1565
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:25,820
basically people at santa fe CMU and michigan about how to work with it and

1566
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:28,530
how to estimate probability distribution

1567
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:32,150
so let so let me just show you how things can happen so i showed

1568
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:36,260
you this picture before the degree distribution for flickr non-linear scale

1569
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:40,390
now i'm putting the same data but now a logarithmic scale right here sort of

1570
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:44,550
see that you know at usually this follows line OK so everything seems to be

1571
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:50,760
so what i'm blocking you here is the core of the city so complementary cumulative

1572
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:54,830
distribution function right so instead of blocking the fraction of

1573
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,680
of nodes have degree

1574
01:44:56,690 --> 01:45:01,530
x plotting the fraction of nodes have degree more and more than equal to x

1575
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:06,510
and what you can see is if this would be consistent with the view of

1576
01:45:06,510 --> 01:45:07,400
power law

1577
01:45:07,410 --> 01:45:11,730
distribution hypothesis then it should be aligned with because you get this like

1578
01:45:11,790 --> 01:45:12,790
OK here

1579
01:45:12,810 --> 01:45:14,030
right so

1580
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:18,290
even though he things here it seems things fall on line actually they don't know

1581
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:20,450
that there is not affected

1582
01:45:20,490 --> 01:45:24,100
so i can then go and feet something as right so if i fit the

1583
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:25,850
power law i would get the line

1584
01:45:25,890 --> 01:45:27,150
but if i'm feeding

1585
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:28,830
has said get it

1586
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:33,220
it that writing style much like CVS

1587
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:34,800
so you could then use these tools

1588
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:38,610
at the change log

1589
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:41,420
built around three when you're happy with it

1590
01:45:41,430 --> 01:45:44,780
it integrates patch files to stand off

1591
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:50,020
you can all people pull your change if you publish your get three

1592
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:53,040
other people are able to pull your kids three

1593
01:45:53,050 --> 01:45:54,590
pregnant again

1594
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:57,450
so what i complain let's get ready

1595
01:45:57,530 --> 01:46:00,260
you can close to somebody else three

1596
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:02,160
or you can pull changes

1597
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:04,790
trees all over the the place develop

1598
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:13,360
i knew push these off the tree maintain eventually the size of the

1599
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:16,970
one of the great things about this is that we change log entry

1600
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:20,780
but added everything you have patched into the territory

1601
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:23,050
you get changed again

1602
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:25,260
when somebody calls for military

1603
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:29,930
they get your change log entry with each that the said changes

1604
01:46:29,950 --> 01:46:35,580
when i was pushed the tree all the way to change logs data

1605
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:40,790
so every change you know what happened who made when

1606
01:46:40,810 --> 01:46:44,360
this also means you know

1607
01:46:44,370 --> 01:46:46,660
who broke

1608
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:51,100
so get out the wonderful command called get play

1609
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:56,730
which can blame tells you who last changed its line co

1610
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:59,680
so you're trying to get right change

1611
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:02,850
article used

1612
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:07,710
it's only given what changed will give you a list of all of the things

1613
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:10,300
that change between two point

1614
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:12,260
so it's history file

1615
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:14,610
every changes back to wild

1616
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:22,460
what the change was who made it when it was made in what order

1617
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:24,340
it doesn't solve every problem

1618
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:25,730
be nice

1619
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:29,510
we now have multiple get three lots of

1620
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:32,850
PC game trees remained friends very

1621
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:34,430
video three

1622
01:47:34,450 --> 01:47:37,120
all these different reasons

1623
01:47:37,810 --> 01:47:42,680
within these trees you can accumulate except changes

1624
01:47:42,710 --> 01:47:47,180
often this is not a problem because most of the time for example nobody else

1625
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:50,640
cares about how PC change the people

1626
01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:55,080
change there are all these changes due in the system

1627
01:47:55,110 --> 01:47:57,640
everybody is happy

1628
01:47:57,650 --> 01:48:03,340
sometimes you get a big sensor changes which was play

1629
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,660
so memory management changes are good examples

1630
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:08,480
if you change part of the

1631
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:10,930
kernel memory management

1632
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:13,750
it's very likely that you will change

1633
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:19,010
recall memory management is shared between all the system in the NN direct

1634
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:23,280
and you will change every single architect

1635
01:48:23,290 --> 01:48:27,840
so you change the i sixty four tree three sixty three

1636
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:32,200
you changed PC tree the tree and so on

1637
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:36,410
and somehow you have to coordinate all of these changes

1638
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:39,400
so they go in the same time

1639
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:45,080
and they all fit together and you don't get completely unbelievable when you when you

1640
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:49,860
try to merge all this together

1641
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:52,920
so can be very hard to coordinate all these things

1642
01:48:53,330 --> 01:48:57,150
what's very recently happened there is now actually called learning

1643
01:48:59,170 --> 01:49:04,270
which is basically combination of all of the trail of the game trees mango trees

1644
01:49:04,270 --> 01:49:06,860
which going to new releases

1645
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:10,790
so let's next is a particularly exciting when kernels arise

1646
01:49:10,930 --> 01:49:14,360
that's the one that nobody nobody but

1647
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:18,750
simply from all the pieces together it's hard to see what happened

1648
01:49:18,790 --> 01:49:23,260
but it does mean the point you see

1649
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:27,510
where the problem is why don't do what machines were broken

1650
01:49:27,530 --> 01:49:29,890
and those can be fixed before

1651
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:33,160
all of these changes thing pushed on linux

1652
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:37,550
so hopefully only the people who intends to run the next three like it really

1653
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:45,410
actually experience the the pain that goes with it

1654
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:50,490
debugging is a very different situation these days

1655
01:49:50,510 --> 01:49:53,590
it used to be a long time ago

1656
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:58,520
there were a small number of people around the new then state

1657
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,660
some the romantics

1658
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:04,900
other than that munich was the

1659
01:50:04,910 --> 01:50:08,830
it's fair to say nearly the eight minutes everybody here and

1660
01:50:09,590 --> 01:50:11,210
pretty much hardcore

1661
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:14,340
unix user develop

1662
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:15,200
and this

1663
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:18,530
it means that all the when you could buy

1664
01:50:18,590 --> 01:50:21,410
you could say for supporting the bug

1665
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:22,730
i think i

1666
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:26,300
can you stick if you debug statements in see what's happening

1667
01:50:27,930 --> 01:50:33,640
his some ideas about how to drive around the city of any of these

1668
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:35,750
most of the users we have today

1669
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:38,280
response to suggestions like

1670
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:43,660
fiddle the driver and see what happens with questions like what drive

1671
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:45,860
and attitudes and actions

1672
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:48,760
this task is to choose actions so as to

1673
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:51,430
maximizing more or get in the future

1674
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:54,480
by that sort of the reinforcement learning problem

1675
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:58,900
it seems like an interesting thing that come back over and over two is that

1676
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:02,420
you can think of a unit of experience the agent has a unit of experience

1677
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:06,110
in the world which is get an observation takes an action get toward and observe

1678
01:51:06,130 --> 01:51:07,870
the next observation

1679
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:09,440
and that

1680
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:12,950
you can think of reinforcement learning is the problem of learning how to act from

1681
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:16,160
these units of experience and this will become

1682
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:18,940
more meaningful is because the reinforcement learning problem

1683
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:24,490
again they choose actions to maximize the expected cumulative reward or some time horizon we'll

1684
01:51:24,490 --> 01:51:27,730
talk about how they cause very precise as we

1685
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:31,050
i define a markov decision process frame just

1686
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:36,190
make sure you understand the larger problem the reinforcement learning about

1687
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:41,640
now observe course that this looks very simple but of course these observations could be

1688
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:44,760
vectors order structures arbitrarily which

1689
01:51:44,790 --> 01:51:49,330
sensory observations the actions can be multi-dimensional white

1690
01:51:50,430 --> 01:51:52,060
simultaneously moving my

1691
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:56,800
my my on my legs my walker card and so on by digg all kinds

1692
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:02,480
of motive motor effecting all kinds of motor actuators

1693
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:04,250
and they one

1694
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:07,070
the one

1695
01:52:07,130 --> 01:52:12,450
aspect reinforcement learning assumes that is less general if you like then the

1696
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:17,420
extreme generality so far is that the we subscribe to what's called the reinforcement learning

1697
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:23,370
hypothesis what's reinforcement learning hypothesis is the hypothesis that an agent acts so as to

1698
01:52:23,370 --> 01:52:26,300
maximize scalar measure reward

1699
01:52:26,350 --> 01:52:29,730
so assume the reward some scalar signal

1700
01:52:29,780 --> 01:52:33,190
whatever it this examples the where the reward might come from but there is some

1701
01:52:33,190 --> 01:52:39,400
scalar reward and instead ask is to maximize some cumulative measure of this scalar reward

1702
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:43,650
of course the reward can be arbitrarily uninformative and we'll see examples of that for

1703
01:52:43,650 --> 01:52:47,290
the more this is very important because may not be apparent what i've been saying

1704
01:52:47,290 --> 01:52:51,470
so far is of course the agent has some partial knowledge about environment

1705
01:52:51,490 --> 01:52:56,030
the agent might have some ability to predict what will happen as it takes actions

1706
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:58,200
in the world so there is

1707
01:52:58,250 --> 01:53:02,560
no commitment to the amount of knowledge it has about twelve

1708
01:53:02,610 --> 01:53:06,570
so you'll see me if you've heard reinforcement learning toxin often hear talks in which

1709
01:53:06,850 --> 01:53:10,970
no knowledge is assumed to be the extreme where a lot of information about the

1710
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:14,950
environment is already known to the agent so we'll we'll talk about this distinction is

1711
01:53:14,950 --> 01:53:16,670
we go to as well

1712
01:53:16,990 --> 01:53:20,600
so here is a listing of some of the key ideas in reinforcement learning that

1713
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:24,310
i want to present today

1714
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:26,680
except the last one two to one

1715
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:31,230
so the the first serve key contribution of the area of modern reinforcement is what's

1716
01:53:31,230 --> 01:53:35,690
called temporal difference or temporal differences idea i will talk in quite a bit of

1717
01:53:35,690 --> 01:53:40,970
detail about that a higher level summary of what temporal differences is that it's really

1718
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:42,730
the idea of updating i guess

1719
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:47,230
on the basis of another guess makes it very different from supervised learning where you're

1720
01:53:47,230 --> 01:53:51,990
updating i guess on the basis of teacher provide information so there's sort of circularity

1721
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:57,590
reinforcement learning to talk about the idea of temporal difference in the key idea reinforcement

1722
01:53:57,590 --> 01:54:02,960
learning reinforcement learning has it is the idea of djibouti traces talk about that idea

1723
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:07,180
what policy learning to this is an outline function approximation for reinforcement learning and then

1724
01:54:07,230 --> 01:54:09,180
hierarchical reinforcement learning

1725
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:14,630
so they begin by giving you a quick demo of reinforcement learning problem here is

1726
01:54:14,630 --> 01:54:18,230
a reinforcement learning problem it's simulated robot soccer

1727
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:21,030
this is the work of storing something

1728
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:25,910
this particular soccer problem is called people way in which

1729
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:27,480
four red players

1730
01:54:27,490 --> 01:54:31,780
we are trying to keep the ball away from the three blue players while staying

1731
01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:38,380
within this square that surrounds the white squares sounds and these are

1732
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:40,010
these robots have sensors

1733
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:43,980
they can sense objects that are within the field of view the field of view

1734
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:50,250
is denoted by the white straight line on these on these circular robots and actions

1735
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:54,900
like kicking the ball and dribbling the ball and so on and the task again

1736
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:57,900
as you can imagine to just keep the ball away from the

1737
01:54:57,950 --> 01:55:01,580
the blue planet and what you're saying that he learned behaviour i show you minute

1738
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:07,000
random behavior so here's the random behavior with this acting randomly and

1739
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:10,920
hopefully you'll see a difference and as to how fast the lose the ball this

1740
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:15,440
is the the ball much faster here than they did in the learning yes

1741
01:55:15,450 --> 01:55:21,640
the rect in this but specific into the red team was learning the blue team

1742
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:22,460
was not

1743
01:55:22,510 --> 01:55:24,990
so neither the

1744
01:55:25,010 --> 01:55:28,550
the defensive players if you like the learning

1745
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:32,050
and i'll talk a little bit more about one interesting aspect of this of course

1746
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:36,730
is that this is a multi agent problem i think michael littman talk about multiagent

1747
01:55:36,730 --> 01:55:40,840
systems i want spend much time multi learning ability to focus on a single latent

1748
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:44,820
learning but just to give you an example of a cluster bombs so here is

1749
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:48,220
the drive the point what might be a good reward function reward is basically you

1750
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:51,460
can imagine they get one unit of reward for every time step to be able

1751
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:52,590
to keep the ball away

1752
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:57,690
so maximizing reward would be maximise the amount of time can keep the ball to

1753
01:55:57,690 --> 01:56:00,840
themselves and the sensors are again

1754
01:56:00,860 --> 01:56:02,930
the ability to detect objects

1755
01:56:02,950 --> 01:56:04,870
within a certain field of view

1756
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:11,360
sensors and the activities of things like traveling kicking ball

1757
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:17,790
so just to complete this little demo they showed that in this forward three keepaway

1758
01:56:17,790 --> 01:56:21,410
pass the learning players to keep the ball we for ten point two seconds of

1759
01:56:21,410 --> 01:56:24,740
the random people with six point c

1760
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:29,390
by the way of covering the idea algorithms and the functionapproximator today so you'll see

1761
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:32,920
the algorithms and the architecture used to one

1762
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:38,690
place be making possibly more concrete by showing you a specific examples and the random

1763
01:56:38,690 --> 01:56:41,730
all for you to write a computer program that does that if you just sit

1764
01:56:41,730 --> 01:56:44,360
down and try and write a computer program by hand

1765
01:56:46,490 --> 01:56:53,090
the solution is to automatically write these computer programs and when we say automatically write

1766
01:56:53,090 --> 01:56:57,390
the computer programs so we actually need is you write a computer program the main

1767
01:56:57,390 --> 01:57:03,270
structure of it but has hundreds or thousands or millions of unknown constants and it

1768
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:07,830
and then you have another computer program which takes as we'll see in a second

1769
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:12,270
database and figures out how to tune the constants in the first program that you

1770
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:17,620
wrote based on the database to optimise performance on the task in one so we

1771
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:22,480
should have in your mind is that very complicated task too complicated to program by

1772
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:27,660
hand and you write a general computer programming has roughly the structure you think will

1773
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:31,820
solve the problem so in this case it might be except the face as input

1774
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:37,420
to compute some sort of general features about the geometry of the image and what

1775
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:42,550
those features using some unknown weights and add up all those weighted features and give

1776
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:44,050
an answer as to win

1777
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:48,150
whether or not it's a particular person something like that these constants are going to

1778
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:53,620
be set automatically for you buy another computer programs and the main focus of everything

1779
01:57:53,930 --> 01:57:59,150
that people study machine learning is that second computer program how can we use it

1780
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:04,200
to set the constant so that's called learning machine learning that the learning approach to

1781
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:05,770
to i

1782
01:58:05,820 --> 01:58:12,330
OK so i just want to quickly go over the sort of difference between core

1783
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:17,190
artificial intelligence which all of you are too young to remember but you might occasionally

1784
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:23,040
encounter in some dusty book and probabilistic AI which is you know what most people

1785
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:27,760
in machine learning work on so some of the core areas of a i like

1786
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:34,410
knowledge representation work with facts and assertions and they develop rules of logical inference you

1787
01:58:34,410 --> 01:58:38,970
know if the glasses on top of this box in the boxes on top of

1788
01:58:38,970 --> 01:58:41,890
the table then the glasses on top of the table

1789
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:47,960
there's a whole area of planning in constraint satisfaction in which people work with

1790
01:58:47,970 --> 01:58:53,380
the applicability or the effects of different actions and ask what sequence of actions should

1791
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:58,410
i choose to get some results how should i schedule my UPF struck so that

1792
01:58:58,450 --> 01:59:02,450
every package gets delivered within the allotted time

1793
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:06,820
and the expert systems are sort of the predecessor maybe to a lot of machine

1794
01:59:06,820 --> 01:59:11,720
learning systems these were set systems that had various rules that were designed by hand

1795
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:17,260
and then those rules would act together to help the system recommend a course of

1796
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:19,970
action or flag an alarm or

1797
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:23,100
alert the user about something that might be happening

1798
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:30,940
so in probabilistic AI the emphasis is on trying to make these systems more robust

1799
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:36,570
more applicable to real world scenarios so the emphasis is on noisy measurements how we

1800
01:59:36,570 --> 01:59:41,380
can approximate getting it we want even though the exact answer might be really hard

1801
01:59:41,950 --> 01:59:46,650
and instead of logical assertions we tend to work with probability distributions

1802
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:52,830
in ten instead of logical inference we tend to manipulate those distributions by producing conditional

1803
01:59:52,830 --> 01:59:57,620
probability distributions and i'll show you that in the second and set of logical operations

1804
01:59:58,040 --> 02:00:02,390
we tend to work with these things called probabilistic generative models and the thing that

1805
02:00:02,390 --> 02:00:06,500
i'll talk about in these lectures are really a general sense of these of these

1806
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:10,440
models so before i go on i want to give you sort of motivating example

1807
02:00:10,860 --> 02:00:12,100
to try and

1808
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:16,180
get you to think about why there's even some issues in machine learning so let's

1809
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:19,620
say that i told you that there was some input here

1810
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:22,070
but i measured and some output

1811
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:24,940
which i wanted you to predict

1812
02:00:24,980 --> 02:00:30,400
and i'm going to give you some examples here are some examples of this input

1813
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,470
output function

1814
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:34,600
OK so you go into the world and you measure the input and this is

1815
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:39,380
the input and for the input you recorded that this was the output and i'm

1816
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:42,850
ask you to make a prediction so i'm going to tell you the new input

1817
02:00:42,850 --> 02:00:43,660
is here

1818
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:50,060
what do you think the output is

1819
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:51,190
OK so

1820
02:00:51,220 --> 02:00:55,110
most of you would have some sense of this is the function may be in

1821
02:00:55,110 --> 02:00:58,590
your mind or in some more formal way you're going to draw a line through

1822
02:00:58,590 --> 02:01:03,050
these things and you're going to make a prediction somewhere around here right

1823
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:07,440
now what i hope to convince you is that this simple thing that you do

1824
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:11,590
in your head because your visual system is so good connecting lines and making smooth

1825
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:16,480
curves actually involves a whole lot of assumptions that we have to think very hard

1826
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:20,270
about and to motivate that i'm going to give you just one example use the

1827
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:23,540
the input is now

1828
02:01:23,590 --> 02:01:29,500
a binary vector

1829
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:32,550
and here's the output

1830
02:01:32,670 --> 02:01:36,890
and then i'm going to ask you to make predictions

1831
02:01:36,910 --> 02:01:40,050
on this new input which you've never seen before what do you think the output

1832
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:45,820
not so easy right

1833
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,400
why is it not so easy

1834
02:01:47,410 --> 02:01:51,570
it's not so easy because it's obvious to anyone that this could either zero or

1835
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:56,890
there's no possible way you could predict this having only seen these inputs right
