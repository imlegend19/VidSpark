1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,120
organs updates perceptron algorithm will find a function that is again on 2 approximation all the function of we

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:15,160
started with the way the trick here is that the you know about the perceptron

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:25,620
algorithm solution has this nice properties of the dual form remember has integer coefficients Ermina's Alphas were just

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,640
changing by 1 each time so they remain integers positive

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,230
integers and the son of the offers is actually less than

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,920
are going to ask what we can have a task where the Gaspard

7
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:41,940
because each time we updated the function we only increased the

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:53,580
some by 1 of the things and so that why as the star almost the definition of all the cover for you just take

9
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:07,460
the cover is wall of those combinations of all of the training examples that you can get the positive coefficients for which more positive for the positive examples of negative the

10
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,840
negative examples but you the positive offers from for

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:22,260
which the uh some of the health as his so but at most some valued the set of for us that we can do and that

12
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:29,820
their use your cover and all you need to Dooster of that set and you can do

13
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,370
that and you can either with a well the log of it is used

14
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,400
this quantity here so it's k log 2 leads to impose k minus

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:51,140
1 of K which is a task for a 2nd square so you can imagine that this is sort of like placing you got you know a Jasper ongoing squared bowls and you got a problem in

16
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,960
June and sorts or 2 ends lots of and so you just go to count it's a common motorial thing

17
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:06,530
of County memory words you could you that are different ways to do know going to carry what together and you get a Band of

18
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,410
the following form wanna generalization which is something

19
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:15,270
that our formal and cases a gospel of Dallas squared into game we've got this

20
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,920
very familiar formentation like that we see the mentioned

21
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:29,730
but we've got a lot of fact a um log factor involves and but the you to carriers also in the denominator of we

22
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:40,670
got the log in Mondale as an end in here but that's not to severe penalties of and the that is the bound and notice it's better than the

23
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,490
old at all because it is only 1 Lord factor Olmert all of

24
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,910
you would have a 2nd factor from the course we don't worry

25
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,530
about the fact that he had so um so that actually is quite a lot time on

26
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:57,550
the generalised which about 4 ASEAN's and you can see that the the gamut is

27
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,350
actually controlling as we suggested generalization this

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,910
actually is already be we've done the structure was

29
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,130
minimisation of account this really is a holding out for

30
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,790
the grammar the user we look at it from so now what I want

31
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,250
you as the exercise is to reconstruct the bound on the

32
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,390
cover numbers so that was the man on the cover and numbers

33
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,420
of ways to this quantity was that's or equal to the

34
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,590
quantity which he was that's so the idea is that some of

35
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,030
you would have might be enough get through the night

36
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:38,650
obviously in common I want to encourage you to work in group so am I going to

37
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,530
make sure that it is going to be some points so what that

38
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,170
is that if a group get to write an old members of the group

39
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,110
get all points so it's a bit like the papers you if

40
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:54,130
publisher paper with 3 authors the credit derivatives tool for every maybe there's a way

41
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,670
of sort of log factor in that you know like a V is the value of the

42
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,430
paper the by by the log and plus 1 more in this number of

43
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:15,670
authors may be something like that in the but blog factors don't mean a thing to do here is so we can have the as a constant here but also everybody gets all the and string courage you

44
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,590
know because I mean really the fun of doing research I

45
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,550
think that too large extent is working groups and the

46
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:27,450
working people who and you cannot help but the if I give a

47
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:35,810
significant of information that also of . from your group on at the

48
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:42,690
end of carrying I'm in this line of work with will see that there is a case of a free pass so the 1st

49
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:51,970
part is the is more like a sort of book work to some extent in and you can see that if I screwed from the Internet if you want to but you have to

50
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,610
try to reduce that so is to prove the convergence the

51
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,430
perceptron convergence or more Acosta their own for the

52
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,000
number of updated the perceptron algorithm is bounded by

53
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:06,710
Austria chemist word it on where X i is the hour is the

54
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,850
bound on the norms of the training examples and gamma is

55
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:21,880
the modern over correctly classified classifying hyperplane normalized weight vector w stop and it with the 2nd emotions algorithm you was assumes no special

56
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:29,590
so there's a structural as you can see from selected and you a hint that there were 2 things you need

57
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,950
to do you need to play an upper bound on the value of all

58
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,070
the mean moles almost squared over weight vector after T

59
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,090
updates remember we started with the weight vector being

60
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,830
zeros norm starts Europe and essentially we have to do is

61
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:51,280
show that it dozen increase that much at each step and that when you have to pay so all the value of all be

62
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:59,770
in a product between WTD and W. stop so you have to show that it increases of by a certain

63
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,990
amount of W 2 dozen increased too much of between in a

64
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,610
product increases by a significant amount of each time and uh putting those

65
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,540
this less complex system the about the systems that recognise antigens and make antibodies and

66
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,470
so on have all these complex networks

67
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,710
which are much more complex only so the vertebrates

68
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,710
does that mean that the vote

69
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,110
it's or

70
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:36,120
we at the pinnacle of evolution with increased complexity really better than the bacteria and

71
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:43,530
and in fact it is an complexity increases we have increased fragility the the the

72
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,370
simple creatures

73
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,140
don't get cancer they don't have a lot of community they don't have inflammatory diseases

74
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,060
we who have

75
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,860
even these more complex

76
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,650
immune systems

77
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:03,890
suffering in a certain way from one fragility which i think is the general principle

78
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,400
if we look at

79
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:14,560
complexity over evolutionary time and take fitness survival and certainly the bacteria

80
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,880
as for as you can get

81
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,520
or imagine they have survived all the

82
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,860
evolutionary pressures

83
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,900
creatures such as dinosaurs and rather than the sun

84
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:37,790
we are here the pinnacle of complexity and just starting to see how much survival

85
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,950
have the case

86
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:46,890
this is the the emergence of complexity which were which is something that we

87
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,850
as physicians and in analysis

88
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:58,100
have to deal with this physicians and want to deal with this immunologist it's not

89
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:07,610
and if one cannot conclude that the most sophisticated complex systems are better adapted are

90
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,450
more fit more fitness if we look at the footnotes as survivors

91
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,180
and one of the questions we

92
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,850
i want to raise looking at all this is what what drives this

93
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,950
development this incessant development of complexity despite the

94
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,060
crashes that occur from time to time one

95
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:40,870
keeps its evolution of complexity going if it really and in the long run does

96
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,340
not generally creatures that have much more

97
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,610
survival capacity then we're ready

98
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,340
a billion years ago with the bacteria

99
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,430
another point

100
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,960
that i

101
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,910
show you some

102
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,550
to say that i

103
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,200
if you ask the question of how

104
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,340
the immune system

105
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,610
computes the

106
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,910
what is it

107
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:21,860
transforming body information into its own information and so there is no one to one

108
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,180
so what we see is the

109
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,420
the development of patterns

110
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,670
one of the kinds of

111
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,710
o devices that we

112
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:39,400
we developed in in my lab from looking at patterns of the immune system is

113
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:46,880
that the robotics and labour and laser

114
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,960
machinery for looking at gene expression and saying let's

115
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,000
take this these machines and look at

116
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:05,120
of antibody expression in the immune system in various states so people know about the

117
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,380
technology of

118
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,200
gene expression

119
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,200
well understand this people down we don't have the time to get into it but

120
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,810
what we do we're able to look at thousands

121
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,000
of interactions in this case

122
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,100
the interaction between

123
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:26,820
body molecules and immune system molecules or the binding of antibodies

124
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,660
the body molecules

125
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,280
a thousands of interactions in turn that into numbers

126
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,110
we can quantify and analyzed

127
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,230
and if we look

128
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:47,320
various segments of the immune system we see some interesting things in this study were

129
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,180
we looked at

130
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,360
the repertoires the antibodies that can bind

131
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,370
molecules from the body

132
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,890
in mothers and in

133
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,340
the newborn babies

134
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:06,420
and we can look at the two kinds of types of antibodies there's the type

135
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,790
of antibody

136
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,770
that is transported

137
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,040
in the uterus from the mother to the baby this is the empirical correlated

138
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,500
is true that would be one hundred years

139
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,310
this is

140
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,000
so this is strictly

141
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,060
the reason why

142
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,730
first of all

143
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,600
you only get one or

144
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,080
we express the role

145
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,150
and also say

146
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:01,370
so o

147
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,210
you can see that you want with that

148
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,750
there's always the first

149
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:20,080
so in

150
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,460
the same thing

151
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,600
he said that

152
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,060
and you for now

153
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,870
nine two and and a three d example

154
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,460
when we think about

155
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,020
some of the past

156
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,370
past that

157
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,710
they are and threshold

158
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,230
and what you want

159
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,440
for women

160
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,190
and as

161
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,980
the label

162
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:42,330
it is possible says that he also

163
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,100
an important is

164
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,000
four years

165
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,170
some say

166
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,850
this is a

167
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,630
and i

168
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,270
the same

169
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,250
so what he

170
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,790
well i used three

171
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,460
we're going to the same

172
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,330
which was

173
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:34,540
that is that this is

174
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,640
it is

175
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,710
i mean

176
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,210
we are

177
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,460
we have

178
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,080
you occasionally see patients

179
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,310
you know

180
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,100
one man was not

181
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,060
one hundred one

182
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,790
the reason why

183
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,310
traditional work

184
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,420
in case

185
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:51,960
this is

186
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,060
once again

187
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,560
to get some degree

188
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,250
we can

189
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,850
the students

190
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,600
just you that

191
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:32,750
meanwhile that

192
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,130
i think it's time

193
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,190
so far

194
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,150
as i know

195
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,560
what's the name

196
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,350
stand by

197
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,350
four and carried

198
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,400
well let's see

199
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,540
by this as

200
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,520
you know some termites some

201
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,370
so for instance

202
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,000
that's what

203
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,350
you have

204
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,870
so what

205
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,000
there's no

206
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,080
thank you

207
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,420
single current wire

208
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,520
it's coming

209
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,640
fortuyn goes into of course it is the wire it goes like this and the

210
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,010
reason why you see

211
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,540
here is because we have to get the current in somehow

212
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,770
it really is the y like this

213
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,550
and this platform i'm going to show you

214
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,260
i'm going to put some island final-round around this

215
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,520
and when they see magnetic field

216
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,570
they will try to orient themselves

217
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:33,730
in the direction of the magnetic field going to see circles

218
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:39,130
but appreciate the fact that you need huge currents for hundreds of years we do

219
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,840
that's why we have a car battery remember that was capable of delivering many hundreds

220
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,090
of mps

221
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,720
so i closed the current now

222
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
i have

223
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:54,610
you can see the circular configuration

224
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,320
you can see that

225
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,140
look like circles

226
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,840
i want to do the same now

227
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,880
a little bit more exciting perhaps

228
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,120
why are going into the plane

229
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,650
and the other one coming out

230
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,670
even though it's not a circle

231
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,410
the idea here

232
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,670
is that you get a feel configuration very much like

233
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,160
you see there

234
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:25,910
it was red hot cable to really hot like

235
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,560
one of them is

236
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,770
OK let's do it this way

237
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,840
so you're going to see if field configuration similar to what i have on the

238
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,540
similar to what you have here although not this one

239
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,970
similar to this

240
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,920
actually it was also one of the this is nice properties

241
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,730
so we have won why going in and won why

242
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,800
coming out of the plane

243
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,720
all right

244
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:07,770
that first put some iron final

245
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,620
now if you want them you through it

246
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,870
you can see close to the wire that goes in

247
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,680
and here

248
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,830
the circles

249
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,510
one of our relationship they dominate the magnetic field

250
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,540
a little bit of imagination you can see these

251
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:37,480
field lines going like this just like i have the on the record

252
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,110
we don't need it anymore

253
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,520
we don't need them

254
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,080
so does give you a a little bit of insight

255
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,400
into the magnetic field configurations

256
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,010
that we have about these

257
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:01,870
why is when we won the current

258
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:06,150
i will return to magnetic fields next lecture we will expand

259
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,320
we all know

260
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,220
techniques to calculate magnetic field

261
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,580
in a way which is highly superior

262
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,330
your survival

263
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,170
in fact that will get us

264
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,860
third next article is almost

265
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,730
but i wanted to relax a little bit because they may already have been a

266
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,420
little rough on you

267
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,310
and so now i want to discuss something entirely different

268
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,430
something very practical

269
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,900
and it has to do with the

270
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,970
or electric energy

271
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,990
so we have the power station somewhere

272
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,520
location a

273
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,050
they deliver

274
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,980
electric power electric energy to boston

275
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,060
here in boston

276
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,800
location b

277
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,970
and and a is the location of the power station this could be

278
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,290
a thousand miles distant

279
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,290
because the cable going from the power station to us

280
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,800
and the potential here in this line

281
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,760
a few people

282
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:16,560
user cable for the return current current goes like this

283
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,640
and the return current is in this direction and

284
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,490
here you use this energy

285
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,370
you will here

286
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,310
cup you're

287
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,840
like the portion and what have you

288
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,340
TV station everything

289
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,520
so you're you the consumer you

290
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,650
take the energy that is provided

291
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,980
by this power station

292
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,070
i will

293
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,520
called the potential

294
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,720
this line zero

295
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,590
and so this is where you have a higher than

296
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,810
this line here

297
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,750
according to

298
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,230
o as lotfi a

299
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,530
is the current

300
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,170
capitol are which is known of radius but that is

301
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,200
resistance in the wire

302
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,040
this wireless cable

303
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,560
however i think it may be

304
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,630
has a finite resistance

305
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,810
so vv

306
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,570
that is the

307
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,660
potential that we receive in in boston

308
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,150
he calls me a

309
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,180
mina xi are

310
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,230
if there is no current going through the wire

311
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,690
no one is using any

312
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:43,410
electric energy than b is the same as you

313
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,020
now i want to know

314
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,840
if we

315
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,440
consume energy

316
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,200
so we're dealing with lower

317
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,880
so the power that we take off in boston

318
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,200
is i times you've been

319
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,500
that's the number of joules per second that we are consuming

320
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,560
so that any

321
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,500
eight times i

322
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,060
minus ice cream or

323
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,170
one is this

324
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,020
the shortest path

325
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:28,230
this is an ally

326
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,360
hopefully it was worth waiting for

327
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,600
reminder the quiz

328
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,300
coming up soon you should be studying for no problem set

329
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,360
two at the same time as the

330
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,350
this is studying now

331
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,950
to take on exams

332
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,880
it's required to come class on monday of course

333
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,380
your comment but everyone watching how should also come

334
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,500
next monday

335
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,870
to get the quiz

336
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,360
this it's the the required lecture

337
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,800
we need to recap in that

338
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:09,310
trilogy so far so the the last two lectures the first two episodes

339
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,180
we're about single source shortest path

340
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:18,670
so we want to find

341
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,520
the shortest path from source vertex to every other vertex

342
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:29,650
and we saw lots of what we saw a few evidence for this

343
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,760
here's some

344
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,940
we can recite in the unweighted case those are the easiest for all the edge

345
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,120
weights were one

346
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,100
then we can use breadth first search

347
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:44,730
and this cost what we call linear time in the graph or of number of

348
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,680
vertices plus number of edges

349
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:51,050
the next simplest case perhaps

350
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,780
nonnegative edge weights

351
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,790
in that case what i really do we use

352
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,380
dykstra are

353
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:12,350
several years what's great

354
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:17,110
OK so this takes

355
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,980
almost linear time if you use a good

356
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,400
keep structure

357
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,360
so we live plus e

358
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,570
and in the general case

359
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,660
general weights

360
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,570
with this film for the song

361
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:39,130
and the costs

362
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:46,270
which is quite a bit worse

363
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,430
this is ignoring log factors dexter's basically linear time

364
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,590
bellman ford is at least quadratic if you

365
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,000
i have connected graphs on the sparse case when is or v

366
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:58,800
these are

367
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:03,710
this is about linear this about quadratic when the dense case one is about the

368
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,360
square this is about

369
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,080
this quadratic and this is cubic

370
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,840
so thanks to a four separated by about a factor

371
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,910
it's pretty

372
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,340
in order to factor which is pretty bad

373
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,360
but that's the best we we know how to do it for single source shortest

374
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:27,570
paths negative edge weights is that the best we also saw

375
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,590
recitation in the case of the DAG

376
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,760
and there

377
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,740
what you do

378
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:45,530
topological sort

379
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:51,260
so you can topological sorting and ordering on the vertices then you run bellman ford

380
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,180
one round

381
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,520
one way to think of what's going on

382
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,630
bellman ford in the order given by the topological sort just once

383
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,960
and you get a linear time

384
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:15,440
so the DAG is another case where we know how to do well even with

385
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,790
we can also do linear time most the time there will be

386
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:23,640
so we should keep these in mind like in the quiz when you get a

387
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,910
shortest path problem or what you end up determining is the shortest path problem think

388
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,380
about what's the best algorithm you can use in that case

389
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,740
OK so that single source shortest path and

390
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:41,020
so in our evolution of the death star initially was just nonnegative edge weights then

391
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,200
we got negative edge weights today

392
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,140
the death star challenges us with

393
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,160
all pairs shortest paths

394
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,250
well one of the shortest path weights between every pair of vertices

395
00:29:53,430 --> 00:30:13,380
OK so let's let's get some quick results locally according to in this case of

396
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,510
for example

397
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,570
suppose i have

398
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,940
an unweighted graph

399
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:30,540
any suggestions on how i should computing all pairs shortest paths

400
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:34,400
between every pair of vertices i want to know the shortest path with

401
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,320
the fifteen minute started on

402
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:41,700
some people at stanford university that have model

403
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:48,440
of specific one distribution he that show that this is indeed what could happen

404
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,610
things like that have not been observed in the practice that you know some of

405
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,250
you may recall like

406
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:59,180
two thousand one to thousand four there have been major war outbreaks that have shown

407
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,580
very rapid growth proliferation

408
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,890
so another problem

409
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,230
symmetry metadata ideas and this is

410
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,980
it should has already been raised here

411
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,120
other applications

412
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,990
the false positive rate

413
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:18,380
the problem is that one might think that this image of it it's not really

414
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,630
sensible defaults for because they only detect what is absolutely

415
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,520
but it can happen that you want to

416
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:31,190
one is trying to develop a general statement for general expressions

417
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,250
that would attacked

418
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,190
you know the the value of different variations of the security

419
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,550
that could also

420
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,070
be sensitive to

421
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,540
normal data set

422
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:47,210
there will be some by chance there will be patterns are also present in north

423
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,340
so what's wrong about one i think the case

424
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:54,420
sometimes this happens cooperation is not really not really

425
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,290
the problem is

426
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,310
again the scale of the data that we have to deal with

427
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,820
so this is and takes like ten ten along today's from an idea you know

428
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,970
stop trusting

429
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,140
do some calculations

430
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,690
how many

431
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,310
what a lot of the great one has to happen in order to have a

432
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,410
false alarm they have

433
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,050
two hundred megabits per second

434
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,570
forty four to dealing with actually

435
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,050
packets day

436
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:35,560
it suffices to have an extremely low false positive rate in order to avoid system

437
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,340
i think about reading this problem but you really

438
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,490
radically rethink the the the

439
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,850
at the false positive rate actually

440
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,100
they are common in the machine learning community

441
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,860
one of the largest cities actually not that are reliable

442
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:58,310
well from the range of false positives and not going to get anything like five

443
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,030
so i percent of all this is completely out of range

444
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:10,790
performance is also make sure so actually you know doing this pattern scanning is

445
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,360
nothing else can each take again

446
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,830
a large number of things so this is what

447
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,960
census signature matching string that problem

448
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:27,090
one think a faster computers can do better but eventually one runs into some physical

449
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,300
problems that

450
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,710
you know the systems

451
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,830
really consume a lot of energy and cooling down

452
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:39,380
to some really if you seen major network infrastructure

453
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:43,130
this is confirmation

454
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,980
so what

455
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,560
why be so what can we do with machine learning in order to

456
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,170
address problem

457
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,190
one thing force you probably seen this

458
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:02,240
many times or in this meeting the machine learning we understand what it means to

459
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:04,740
two to

460
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,010
general so

461
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,980
what it means to have to get to their

462
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,450
it is also the case that

463
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,560
machine learning learning some compact representation

464
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,970
the semantic based approach

465
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,550
there is in fact nothing else memorizing dates

466
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,750
and trying to do some very good classification by

467
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:33,620
comparing two packet with something that we have already seen exactly instance based

468
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,840
classification that have exact match

469
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,620
you know what we do have a long

470
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,460
machine learning officer major

471
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,660
reduction of the complexity of the

472
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,270
concept of the building and that's why

473
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,740
we can hope to have a performance

474
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,890
finally with a very important

475
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,470
the true anomaly detection we can detect novel

476
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:03,020
and it turns out that i has to do fundamentally unusual thing

477
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,710
we have seen both flows

478
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,310
requires some strands binary information and this is inherently

479
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,300
and usually very specific behavior

480
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,300
have a good reason to believe that by doing the knowledge based on the fact

481
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,040
that we can detect novel

482
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:28,380
so the causal issues in machine learning that i have to dress by applying

483
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,200
but dealing with non victorian structured data so that

484
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,360
they're important extract meaningful features

485
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,970
how to be able to pass the features into

486
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,030
internet states in order to run algorithms

487
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,040
it's difficult to get

488
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,310
and we use labels for the state again this is

489
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,020
we have seen that this problem is also

490
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,070
typical four

491
00:35:54,090 --> 00:36:00,110
other applications of machine learning semantic security problems that

492
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,050
in order to get have to analyse and really very complicated information look at

493
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:05,830
the role

494
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:11,880
content of network packets it's very difficult to really understand what's going on that so

495
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,070
it is a very

496
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,500
time consuming process might also be

497
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,120
and we use the tower

498
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,900
rather than attack pertains to impact

499
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,740
because might be part of an attack president once again another

500
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,980
i be really

501
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,840
very carefully distributed

502
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,140
malicious noise

503
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,730
my try to

504
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,960
this guy is activity

505
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,770
four tried to subvert the learning process

506
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,000
in order for an algorithm to learn

507
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,770
different concepts

508
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,570
that is less robust to detect attacks

509
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,010
and we also have to deal with hybrid animals that's why

510
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,670
it's very important to have

511
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,090
efficient algorithm

512
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:04,970
and many of my talk i will present a structure chosen algorithms

513
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,080
our learning basic ideas have developed

514
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,740
and show some

515
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:14,950
applications that from machine learning techniques that had to developed in order to

516
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,760
make this system work

517
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:23,610
so don't structure system basically follows the typical

518
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:28,010
architecture of intrusion detection system two main components being

519
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,750
the feature extraction

520
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,020
and the detector components model

521
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:36,740
concentrate will show you some technical details of

522
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,210
those two parts

523
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,360
so essentially the

524
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,950
feature extraction

525
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:44,270
the question now out information

526
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,840
three ways to to do this

527
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,010
detectors can in principle be any

528
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,380
learning methods that

529
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:59,330
no anomaly detection classification clustering and ranking third so i will present some of the

530
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,660
anomaly detection

531
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,450
so how to extract features from the

532
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,780
the title

533
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:18,010
it's still looking you forty one translated from m on eight fourteen

534
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,850
so if you have a lot of four here for the this is entry twenty

535
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:26,440
different amino acids and this translation like this one here

536
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:33,210
always been looking tied together if one can encode one i mean we at together

537
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:39,780
it fought with the power the different possibilities right sixty four possibility and each of

538
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,310
these possibilities caught one i mean

539
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:47,760
so you can make the chain on a we can make a chain order of

540
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,290
and this is the translation

541
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,140
there some special

542
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:02,910
called on a special people which terminate the sequence b this course

543
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,270
OK so this is the structure of

544
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:10,980
so one part which is twenty five

545
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:15,010
this is what is copied to them on then there are other things which are

546
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:21,280
controlling when the transcription started depending on the different conditions in the cell when the

547
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,860
plant maybe beliefs would need to run in different

548
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,260
programme as the rule one

549
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:34,260
the need to express different proteins then under different conditions

550
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,610
these conditions i actually encoded in the promoter region

551
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:43,100
this is like a lot of small which is which control

552
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:49,270
he i mean the amount of expression over that is completely silenced

553
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:53,200
on the twenty five regions several parts

554
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,060
essentially the

555
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:00,190
it contains exonintron intron are removed

556
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:04,810
in the process which is called lighting the only the x eleven

557
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,830
in the five months

558
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,740
so the first copy

559
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,060
when you remove all the front

560
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,020
and then you get the back one

561
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,910
this but on a part of that is translated

562
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,940
this is a vector

563
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:28,800
actually quite nice illustrations of transcription splicing and translation like movie which you can with

564
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,950
explanations which just watch

565
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,230
maybe in the brain

566
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,150
OK what you get is b

567
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,630
the protein sequence

568
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,650
and here in the protein sequence consists of

569
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,830
i mean it

570
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,450
on the twenty different of them

571
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,290
and this just on long chain

572
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,980
but it

573
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,520
not just chain this chain can form structure

574
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:59,370
and the sequence the sequence of amino acids just the primary sequence

575
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,100
the primary structure then

576
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,030
secondary structure that not remote like he

577
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,080
so you see that

578
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,930
they can almost expect a

579
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:17,280
hydrogen bond between green position then

580
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,270
and what we also have a beta strand

581
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,610
completely different structure and you can

582
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,910
put them one on top of each other

583
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,030
OK so can build like what

584
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,690
so this is a secondary structure of the structure elements you can build a much

585
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:40,190
more complicated structures for instance just give you some idea

586
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,620
o complex these things can look like is just four beta strands which are stacked

587
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,870
next to each other this is

588
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:55,790
just to the combination of the to spend the the strengths and opportunities and you

589
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,820
see all kinds of different shapes here

590
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,490
corresponding to the shapes of the different functions associated

591
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,170
so functions related to information processing

592
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:16,000
like extracellular sensing so that the first which are outside the cell wall on the

593
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,370
cell border and they can

594
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,270
recognise that certain conditions

595
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,960
they can

596
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,750
and proteins which are just there for signal transduction can

597
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:33,770
if the information from one according to to the next

598
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:40,050
and signal transduction is part one then the regulation of gene expression

599
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:44,140
so depending on external conditions you might be able to switch on and off the

600
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:52,330
in control things like cell cycle one hundred twenty different range

601
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:56,180
so you can have different issues in the

602
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,570
so there other proteins which are involved in metabolism so

603
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:06,680
to get energy to synthesize proteins on a b a

604
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:11,910
and also for the biogenesis of cellular components like hell all these things

605
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:19,330
and other proteins are just there for the cell structure or send out

606
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,330
so what you

607
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:25,390
so it's not i mean what you see from that the

608
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:31,260
amount functions is quite broad so it's hard even to describe what about the function

609
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:37,730
of the protein and they have different maybe conflicting aspects of function so in certain

610
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:45,380
biological reactions function might be like catalyze something but on on the cell might be

611
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,690
involved in energy production or in

612
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,840
regulation of

613
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,410
of the cell cycle

614
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,340
so there are different levels of description what

615
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:04,310
but also the function of the protein might depend on the context

616
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:12,660
so the protein function and depending on image so this might be two different things

617
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:18,670
so the function classification that is to a certain degree the arbiter

618
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:23,880
so it is often described the tree but even that is not the

619
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:29,740
OK i have a question for the baby basic things like

620
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,850
the central dogma

621
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,850
first go at

622
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,020
we do it or more

623
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:39,940
well we're looking the vision that like the white

624
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,190
there and read it like you

625
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,600
and let it slide something on it

626
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,800
right of you

627
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,680
so yellow thing

628
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,440
now we don't need further

629
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:02,340
on the left really

630
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,230
all right there

631
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,640
i did not we find the global right

632
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:10,970
so that's

633
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:12,680
now when we draw

634
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,920
they point on the green

635
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,250
is only a very small chance we

636
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,590
what they

637
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:20,900
the above red

638
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,640
what is above the red lines are rejected they no longer there

639
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,180
and with drinking water yellow

640
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,220
now make another of the green line

641
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:32,810
and that's that

642
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,460
so he stayed home in one piece

643
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,050
now i do thing

644
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,750
make a proper up there

645
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,100
that we are one people another

646
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,760
and we could have done no matter how low the values that

647
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,390
not really across very very

648
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,130
well feel you value and very will be being in the way

649
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:00,380
and yet we can

650
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,420
the property

651
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:03,930
they god one another

652
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:08,680
now we look whether you know what i think it's really really know what

653
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:13,870
you know on the now when we do you think you very rule we

654
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,760
growth that's

655
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,550
will be on left

656
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:23,180
thank you

657
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,300
why don't know all about the hopping between the

658
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:32,550
andy that was applied on

659
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:33,840
if we run along

660
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:38,050
if have will be

661
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:40,920
well why don't you

662
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:46,180
that's why sampling

663
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,760
and in particular there and read mail

664
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,100
in book published free software that implements this

665
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:53,940
it's not

666
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:54,870
and it's

667
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:58,810
very very general all you need is the ability to evaluate red

668
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,120
when you are

669
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,980
really nice thing to note about like it never

670
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,710
ends up rejecting

671
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,590
overall proposal it it worked and worked and what was in the end

672
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,760
you've got somewhere and that somewhere will be different from where you got

673
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:18,930
in contrast the standard published the way you might do a huge amount of hamiltonian

674
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,870
monte carlo simulation finite element will learn that

675
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,120
project and you just throw it all away

676
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,720
and have made any progress

677
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,050
it your link will move

678
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,590
only a very small this about maybe the right we may be dealing with a very small

679
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,580
so it never get another beauty of

680
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,140
slice sampling is

681
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,430
that's why w is not a crucial parameter

682
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:48,440
if you're w is accidentally ten times as big as it needs to be done

683
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,230
about it only takes a very small number of points shrink down

684
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,470
that the correct way

685
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:02,010
and if w small it only takes a small number setting up operations which proceed linearly

686
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,460
over small we think

687
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,880
only small number that will be required

688
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
in comparison with the red region

689
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:17,160
w is crucial it's still a good idea unit but you don't have a catastrophic

690
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,690
failure if you get your w two small and large

691
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:23,980
and slice sampling doesn't have the property that typically

692
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,310
you will make

693
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,590
there is a big at the with the dealing with

694
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:30,930
so it

695
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,400
the final step

696
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,260
is all

697
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,580
roughly the optimal size

698
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,260
that's why sampling

699
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:47,930
and i would like to

700
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:49,930
finished with today is the about

701
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:51,300
exact sampling

702
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,810
how long you you need to run a monthly column the four

703
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:57,720
i'm gonna tell u

704
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,620
what feels to me i

705
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:07,800
really quite amazing breakthrough be among our community for decades they answered the question how long running around all

706
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:09,340
well i long

707
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,300
bring you don't really know that you you get a better value make diagnostic will

708
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:20,190
get belong answer the question how long run of the newly founded by

709
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:25,580
there was a breakthrough and it happened in approximately nineteen ninety six

710
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:32,350
with the invention of methods that are all i call exact sampling the alternative that sampling

711
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,710
and the the whole family of different

712
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,040
sampling methods

713
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,710
and i'm going to describe to

714
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:41,970
mean if you want to explain probably

715
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,550
the paper one

716
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:46,460
but maybe hundred

717
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:51,790
how long should we run the simulation or

718
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:59,130
exact sampling based on the idea that should

719
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,760
rather different long time you

720
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:03,760
how long

721
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,510
infinitely large

722
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:10,370
there for

723
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,090
you might say

724
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:16,980
like all of it

725
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,760
but it be feel

726
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,380
you can establish the outcome of an infinitely long

727
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,630
the finite amount you are

728
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:29,630
and we're going to run

729
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:31,160
the simulation

730
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,660
from the pack

731
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:35,180
from infinitely long and that's

732
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,340
up to

733
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,190
the president

734
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:43,510
had about how

735
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,120
well let me explain

736
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,430
let's imagine that this is the they they all

737
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:55,970
and for simplicity

738
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:01,090
call let's imagine we're talking about these lecturer flipping a coin

739
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:07,550
determine whether you go right or left in the like that but it faces is why that they

740
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,230
like this

741
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:14,810
and now i'm asking you to imagine that an infinite time ago

742
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,600
a little army and twenty one

743
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,130
all started

744
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,960
at i might be

745
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,020
twenty one that location and every one of them

746
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,670
then started

747
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,400
running the monte-carlo simulations what

748
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,930
so imagine that happened

749
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:43,760
and imagine that they use the same random numbers

750
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:47,590
random numbers

751
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,750
all of them are shown here in the first one

752
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,520
had had had found no

753
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,330
so the plant

754
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:03,670
and any time we imagine we can consult the little encyclopedia

755
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:08,600
outcome we can say at time minus one thousand seven hundred thirty two

756
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,470
what the you have

757
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:12,330
in the right itself

758
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,590
help when come back to that sound like he did tell me again what would

759
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,710
become one of them two it will tell you

760
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,390
right all not going along

761
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:28,480
had one of them

762
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:35,380
you know

763
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:40,910
all this phenomenon with a very small set of actions of principle then you're happy

764
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:42,970
and you know it

765
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,950
so you want to explain many things with

766
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,960
if you see

767
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:53,010
and these principles are these actions of postulates they i mean they can be called

768
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:56,250
assumptions axioms and postulates or in it

769
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,830
an example of is the only one

770
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:06,820
principle of relativity the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of

771
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,880
so this is really something that

772
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:14,660
you can't really prove you just say OK let's assume this is true

773
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:19,940
if this is true what can we derive from that what are the consequences

774
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:23,710
that's the important point here

775
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,330
these assumptions you can never who

776
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:29,500
you can only you know

777
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:33,490
i cannot figure out what are the consequences of these assumptions

778
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,790
and then going the nature and try these things and test whether that's one of

779
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:41,600
the consequences

780
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:42,730
and of course

781
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,620
a good theory

782
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,280
would have few

783
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:53,240
we define what serine knowledge define what is learning

784
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:55,280
so learning i mean you all

785
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,190
three could envision what is learning

786
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,900
but the mixing precise

787
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:03,330
definition you can find in a dictionary

788
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:06,330
to gain knowledge conference in factory

789
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,910
or mastery of

790
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:10,100
through experience of that

791
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:14,650
the study is kind of the easy case study something you know it

792
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:19,980
so we focus on this part of it but more on learning

793
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,980
o experience so you do something

794
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,000
as you do is you

795
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:28,880
kind of gained knowledge comprehension my understanding

796
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:32,240
so you know where you you build your own mental model

797
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:43,190
interestingly is the interesting part is when you don't just accumulate observations but you really

798
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,720
create your own representation of the world and you have some

799
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:49,680
into the model that allows you not only two

800
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,790
account for what observed but also

801
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,220
it allows you to make predictions about the future

802
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,860
so i mean all these works

803
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:06,790
you can consider them as meaning the same thing in the context of this lecture

804
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,900
so this leads us to an interesting

805
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,610
i mean if we look at the definition of learning and definition of series

806
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,560
we we get some kind of

807
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:18,080
weird circularity here

808
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:23,420
so we have say what is serious and what it how it should be constructed

809
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,480
in series really

810
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,420
making observations and constructing a model of this observation

811
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,600
the question is

812
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,720
why did i tell you all that

813
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:44,110
actually building story is really the same induction which is the same as i said

814
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,830
as learning learning

815
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:49,630
you observe things learning from experience is

816
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,490
you observe singing you make

817
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,090
a kind of internal model of these things

818
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:57,320
and building a series of the same so

819
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:58,940
you know it's kind of

820
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:04,010
circular here i'm i'm telling you that learning is building series and i'm i want

821
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:04,450
to this

822
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:11,660
on the here so let me rephrase that a bit to induction is the process

823
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,680
of building series

824
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:14,980
learning theory

825
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:18,780
the main focus of learning theory is the phenomenon of induction

826
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,650
so how can we

827
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,360
in this variable

828
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,720
in the series

829
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:29,020
so i mean i i will go more into the details of that but it's

830
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,600
just too you know emphasise that

831
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,240
this whole thing is

832
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:35,970
involving a lot of philosophical issues

833
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:41,240
and i will touch upon some of the some of them later on

834
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,150
try to further now

835
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:50,420
so OK now you have the a wrong idea of what is it that we're

836
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:52,250
trying to do with learning series

837
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,200
now why is it that we are

838
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,860
thanks to do that

839
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:59,000
i like this quote

840
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,730
i mean you can find it in about six book

841
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:10,260
and i think it does and doesn't say that it's from her

842
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:14,780
well i don't know why i look on the internet and that's the kind of

843
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:20,940
reference that is given most of them but maybe it was reduced by many people

844
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,110
i mean

845
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:30,020
what else can i say

846
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,620
no i mean more seriously

847
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:37,640
these are the things that i think are important

848
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,150
first of all we want to understand what's going on when we learning right

849
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,840
and we want to

850
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:47,580
study the properties of different learning algorithm and be able to say OK this is

851
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:51,090
better why in this context is better

852
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,070
these so the idea in there

853
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:56,040
not just by

854
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:58,780
you know trying it on on various kinds of data but

855
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:04,270
by being able to say i mean to make some general statements

856
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,020
that should lead us to you know

857
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:16,880
a way to design better algorithms for certain

858
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,310
so again this induction version that's the

859
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,370
i mean kind of repeating the same thing over and over again

860
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:30,860
very flavours hoping that you will get the message here

861
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:34,110
if you compare induction induction but really

862
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,740
what is kind of most restricting about studying induction is that

863
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,440
action is can can can be easily justified i mean once you've agreed upon the

864
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,370
then you

865
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:44,830
one of the right

866
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:49,040
and the rules for combining these actions then you derive the consequences you your here

867
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,970
and nobody can easily this area is correct

868
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:55,760
provided that everyone agrees on the

869
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:59,230
before induction is exactly the opposite you can't really

870
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,590
justify anything

871
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:07,580
you know if someone comes up with one action about some observations you can only

872
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:11,480
test the consequences of these actions so make deductions from that and then

873
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:16,580
take that is true i mean take that corresponds to local relates to your observation

874
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,190
but you can't really

875
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,490
you know full boarding school

876
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:23,020
and actually and

877
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:25,150
you can't really argue about the the

878
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,340
proofs of of some induction

879
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,030
that's it

880
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,260
i mean let's let's make these

881
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:38,040
now people can create and i will give you some examples two

882
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,710
you know for you to reason about thing

883
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,150
here is an example

884
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,380
so let's say we observe the sun

885
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:47,310
every morning and we see that its

886
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,980
rising every morning i mean the usual

887
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:55,410
example is europe whether you son is writing from the east of on the west

888
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,220
but let's let's just say

889
00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:00,130
we observe that the sun is rising every morning

890
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,310
for a number of the day

891
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:08,280
and the question i'm asking you is OK given that you observed that forty days

892
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:10,840
what is your estimate of the probability

893
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:14,940
that the sun will rise again tomorrow

894
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,490
this is a

895
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:22,610
suppose you have some integer points in the latter

896
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,320
and then i have no relaxation of this

897
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,690
it's an easy thing to

898
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:34,490
the point here

899
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:44,240
and so

900
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:47,690
the point of the integer things that really interested in that so

901
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:53,900
so this is isn't some two-dimensional space and doesn't respond to exactly k and what

902
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,220
i'm doing is optimizing a linear function in terms of use

903
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:01,690
right and the question is one of the function i'm going to end up some

904
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,570
because it and the benefits as well but

905
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,530
let's think about monday degenerate case when one corner

906
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:14,530
OK so if all the corners are discrete

907
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:18,190
then and guarantee that i can find

908
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,150
an optimal solution is discrete

909
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:22,880
OK so if face is not a problem why because

910
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:27,720
well basically it means that either this or or this one

911
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:32,090
solution have the same score so just pick one of them

912
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:34,670
so you can show

913
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:41,720
this this polytope right this this kind of a set of linear constraints in the

914
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,760
space of these makes

915
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:49,260
structures such that all its corners

916
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,710
are discrete

917
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,010
so we want to optimize a linear function

918
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:56,860
over that space is going to end up in corner

919
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,260
and getting into solution

920
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:03,240
OK so this has to do

921
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:09,510
so can come back to that in certain graphical models why that's easy why that

922
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,010
happens but

923
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:15,070
you know

924
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:18,400
so i got maybe i'll come back to to white why that happens but but

925
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,400
this is kind of

926
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:21,990
the common

927
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:26,360
so there see if can sense if you can do something with dynamic programming

928
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,860
you can write it down as a linear in some senses the linear as a

929
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,210
linear programme as well

930
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:35,150
in the linear programme is going to give you integer solutions in the dynamic programming

931
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,860
integer solutions

932
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,440
this is not true if we have more complicated now network if we have an

933
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:44,510
arbitrary network and no

934
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:45,800
constraints on

935
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:47,760
what the potentials are

936
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,300
right then we cannot guarantee that this is going to give us

937
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,650
and entrance

938
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:56,090
so what happens that if we get a fractional and say

939
01:02:56,110 --> 01:03:01,030
what happens is in a maximizing right that means we get some zero doesn't correspond

940
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:01,940
to y

941
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,820
and usually that's going to mean that

942
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,980
this is going to be

943
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:07,420
bigger than any real life

944
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:11,570
so this is going to give us an upper bound on their real life

945
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:14,220
let's look at this

946
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,740
associative markov network ltd

947
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,240
so there is that we have these variables e j

948
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,070
which are you know

949
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:28,320
for each position then fuzzy take turns out we only need to track the ones

950
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,240
that are on the diagonal

951
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,490
because everything else is zero

952
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:35,860
well i wanted to log there their one slide to the log

953
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,280
the thing was zero

954
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:42,690
so i just have variable and that all it says is this position and disposition

955
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:44,990
and they both on

956
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:48,260
prec and then if labels on i get this bonus

957
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,490
that we have the

958
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,110
so that's you writing down linear objective

959
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:58,630
to write down the constraints

960
01:03:58,670 --> 01:03:59,670
you do

961
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,280
the thing we did before

962
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,820
zjn equals one meaning that

963
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,960
each position has only one label

964
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:13,130
and the edge something slightly different and that's because you assume that this weight

965
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:18,590
OK if that way is positive

966
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:21,030
what happens as the optimized

967
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,980
z jk is going to become

968
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:25,940
the minimum of the two

969
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:30,460
because it's trying to push against both of them as you get stopped by

970
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:33,090
the smallest of the two

971
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:35,030
if they are

972
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:36,740
actually integers

973
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:41,460
red zero one then the minimum is going to be just the and the

974
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:45,720
so if everything is happy and images are all integral

975
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:47,220
then i j k

976
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,490
written down this way and with these constraints

977
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:53,170
and the maximum is going to mean exactly one and we wanted it came to

978
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:57,240
end of these two things

979
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,440
and so

980
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:02,980
this is the linear constraints this is the set of this is the objective if

981
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:05,880
she calls two

982
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,320
right so we have this to binary problems

983
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,990
then you can also show that

984
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:13,240
this thing has integer corners

985
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:16,490
this is something that i'm i am not claiming that i did this right so

986
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:20,690
this is this is the well known fact in combinatorial optimization it has to do

987
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,530
with the constraint matrix

988
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:25,670
OK so you can show for the other one is well there's a different condition

989
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:27,840
for the matrix a

990
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:31,840
it's called telling to talk to you know what

991
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:36,670
that's one way to read

992
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:40,510
and that means that every if you take a look at this matrix area basically

993
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:45,240
blind always disease in vector matrix sitting there

994
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:50,440
vector and then you have some constraints and

995
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,780
less than or equal to b

996
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,050
and as long as the integrals

997
01:05:55,070 --> 01:06:00,530
and a set modular meaning that every seven determinant of a

998
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:01,460
is there

999
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,960
minus one or zero

1000
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:10,650
this is something you can you can

1001
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,800
for this matrix and for bunch other ones

1002
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:16,800
every sub chairman things

1003
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,840
is that

1004
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:22,440
it turns out that for any objective whatever q is it doesn't matter

1005
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:27,150
the corners of the guy going to be in the world and the way this

1006
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,030
works is because

1007
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:30,860
the solution

1008
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,900
right now i'm going to have some of these constraints be active

1009
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:39,610
so there going to be some some semantics of that matrix is called the

1010
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:41,320
that hit

1011
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,490
with equality

1012
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:51,820
and you know if this is full rank setting everything full rank then you just

1013
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:58,920
if this is integral in the terms of the one minus one

1014
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:02,030
and zero then is going to go as well

1015
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:03,300
this is the

1016
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:08,420
that if you want proof of this thing about recognising the matrix is due to

1017
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:10,570
you know totally unimodular

1018
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:16,960
it is actually hard problem but we know that these kinds of problems the ones

1019
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,530
that arise from

1020
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:21,550
of course

1021
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:23,370
i can use of the internet

1022
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:27,220
represent any distribution or market or anything

1023
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,820
i would say we should invite

1024
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,220
it's just that

1025
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:37,180
the number of conditional independence statements implied by network

1026
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:41,910
i mean

1027
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:45,680
sorry the punisher state by by the vision that

1028
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:50,410
may be smaller than the number of conditional independence statements really

1029
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:52,700
the reason for this

1030
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,890
likewise from my view

1031
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:57,120
not exactly what you need

1032
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:00,680
like which is the case

1033
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,300
it's not

1034
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:05,720
that is

1035
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:07,970
then diagram

1036
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:10,930
show that

1037
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:16,430
so there are grounds for example that you can construct by combining information that might

1038
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:22,780
however what people call a chain graphs and then use chain graph the rule is

1039
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:26,840
somewhere in this area

1040
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:29,340
you do not necessarily cover

1041
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:46,910
so let's see what michael i think it's

1042
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:51,140
to markov blanket forgiven

1043
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:54,800
the markov blanket of a given observation x one

1044
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:57,010
this is the markov field

1045
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,530
the markov blanket of a node

1046
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:03,610
is the smallest set of goals

1047
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:08,800
when a condition is violated on the walls

1048
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:15,340
i have the the same distribution this condition for all the other

1049
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:17,640
in other words the neighbors

1050
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:22,240
in quotes

1051
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:27,110
hopes for macromolecules

1052
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,450
the neighbors

1053
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:34,700
the markov blanket is the set of direct technique

1054
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,570
when the manage

1055
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,120
four bayesian networks

1056
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:44,410
the markov blankets are the parents

1057
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,890
the children

1058
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:48,390
which are connected directly to the north

1059
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:54,220
but you also need to include the co parents

1060
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:59,430
those that are also parents of missing children

1061
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:04,390
and you yourself why

1062
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,850
link about

1063
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:10,110
one exercise could try to

1064
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:13,700
try to show that the markov blanket of i

1065
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:17,850
in the bayesian network is given by human parents

1066
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:24,470
and sure the markov blanket of alignment is given by its name

1067
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:28,140
you time to think about this problem

1068
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:33,620
that's all

1069
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:36,850
what's remarkable when

1070
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:40,990
because of what's called the markov condition which is that these

1071
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:44,590
which is the probability

1072
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:49,640
given all the other five

1073
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:53,640
is equal to the probability of only given name

1074
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,820
the markov condition

1075
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:58,890
our local conditions

1076
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:04,350
defined by the graph g

1077
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,840
the conditional

1078
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:11,740
o insights about this question

1079
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:21,550
so there are there is a simple complicated depends

1080
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:26,070
what you

1081
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:39,340
child head to head

1082
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:41,850
with respect to parents

1083
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:44,010
yes that's true

1084
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:46,820
parameters for example the right hand sides

1085
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:51,420
because for example this could be a resource constraints in some

1086
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:55,150
application and interested in how

1087
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:00,760
well this function looks like the change the upper limits on resources

1088
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:01,700
how quickly

1089
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,070
this the

1090
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:07,470
the optimal value function change

1091
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:10,420
so one thing we can say of course we can always compute this function by

1092
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:11,650
solving the p

1093
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:14,630
for a given x we can solve this to find your facts

1094
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:18,450
they also know that it's a convex function of x

1095
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:22,590
and and again follows from the minimisation rule and to apply this we have to

1096
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:23,680
define f

1097
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,900
so in this case f of

1098
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:29,950
x y would be just see transport y

1099
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:34,320
and as its domain of the function and we take the pairs x y

1100
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:36,720
that satisfy the inequality

1101
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:41,280
outside the domain we define a function fs plus infinity

1102
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:44,450
so this is a convex function jointly x y

1103
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:47,440
because its domain is convex so that's just linear

1104
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:49,700
linear inequalities in exile i

1105
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,490
so many is convex

1106
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:53,820
and on its domain it's linear

1107
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,380
so it's also convex

1108
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,650
so this function is convex jointly in x y

1109
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,970
and here we minimize over

1110
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:06,260
with no constraints actually online

1111
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:10,510
so the result is always a good necessarily convex and the remaining variables x

1112
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:17,860
and the last properties

1113
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:21,590
called perspective

1114
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:25,490
so suppose i have a convex function of f of x f of x

1115
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:27,900
and i can define a new function

1116
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,720
g of an x and x variability

1117
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:36,510
by replacing x in the argument of by x or t

1118
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:39,170
and then multiplying fifty

1119
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,880
and that's called the perspective of a function f

1120
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:46,450
and it has the nice property that if f is convex

1121
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:49,420
and i restrict this to positive values of t

1122
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:53,470
then this perspective is always called

1123
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:58,750
and for example allows us to immediately see that this is quadratic over linear function

1124
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:01,030
and give us an example is convex

1125
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:07,130
because i five take f of x just cesspools access convex very replace x over

1126
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:09,570
y x over t

1127
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:16,720
and multiply routine and just get access was actually for positive t so that's convex

1128
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:23,130
another example from information theory is the negative entropy

1129
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:26,050
the negative logarithm if i use

1130
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:26,920
f of x

1131
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:30,530
minus log x is a convex function of x

1132
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:36,240
so far uses apply this construction replace x over by activity and i multiply the

1133
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,630
result with t

1134
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:39,650
then that is is this function

1135
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:42,820
p times log of t of x

1136
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:48,740
and so because of this that's convex jointly in xnt

1137
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,920
it's called the relative entropy

1138
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:55,740
and it's not immediately obvious because the first term is convex t lochte is convex

1139
01:14:55,740 --> 01:15:01,610
because that's the entropy but the second term separately has no interesting convexity properties

1140
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:05,150
but the combination of the two is convex because of

1141
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,900
this because it's the perspective of a convex function

1142
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:19,300
so that's all i wanted to say in a theory of convex sets and functions

1143
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:25,420
there any questions about this

1144
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:28,130
so the next we look at some

1145
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:32,680
definitions and examples of convex optimization problems

1146
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:36,720
so we define a convex optimization problem is the function of the common problem is

1147
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,440
a convex objective

1148
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:42,150
convex inequality constraints and the equality constraint

1149
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,740
so it's the general

1150
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:50,260
mathematical optimisation problem that started with that fifty if i is restricted to be convex

1151
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,320
so obviously the feasible set is convex because

1152
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,760
it's the intersection of

1153
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,170
and that's fine set a solution of the

1154
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:06,200
in equations and then sublevel sets of different convex functions so it's a convex set

1155
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:11,760
also a show that locally optimal points unnecessarily globally optimal

1156
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:17,260
and so the most important property of this is that it's easy to solve theory

1157
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:21,860
in terms of complexity theory but also in practice because there exists

1158
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,070
more and more

1159
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:31,200
is obtained software for solving optimization convex optimization problems

1160
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,880
so the

1161
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:39,300
the simplest examples LP if we restrict all the inequality constraints to linear

1162
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:44,630
the solutions so that looks like this is supporting here and defined by different inequalities

1163
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:49,860
and then the constraints is the objective is to minimize the transpose x

1164
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,700
so you can easily see that the optimal value of the optimal solution would be

1165
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:56,340
at the boundary of the polymer

1166
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:01,110
and it is typically one of these extreme point of the body

1167
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:04,920
and you can find visualize solution by just considering

1168
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:09,490
the level curves are sets of constant value of c test was exposed the

1169
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:10,470
so these

1170
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:15,800
the level curves are hyperplanes it's a normal vector minus c

1171
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:19,470
so those are the sets of constants objective value

1172
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:22,260
they decrease in the direction of minor c

1173
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:26,400
and then we look look for the point in the output here and the smallest

1174
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,650
value c transpose x in this case that's the opt

1175
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:37,450
so in practice it's not too difficult to recognise convex functions

1176
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:38,650
so if

1177
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:42,820
linear optimization linear programming problems in practice

1178
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,340
so typically there arise from

1179
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:49,510
it's not immediately obvious BLP stuff typically

1180
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:52,490
go from piecewise linear functions

1181
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:55,780
for example if i want to minimize the function f of x that is defined

1182
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:57,110
as the maximum

1183
01:17:57,150 --> 01:17:58,990
pointwise maximum of

1184
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:01,010
linear functions of x

1185
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:03,360
then we already know that it's convex

1186
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:05,950
because each of the french is convex

1187
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:10,070
it's not differentiable so it's not

1188
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:15,130
immediately obvious how to solve it using gradient descent or newtons method

1189
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:19,280
but it's easy to solve the LP

1190
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:24,800
using a very common trick introduce new variable t and minimize the this new valuable

1191
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,840
subject to

1192
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:28,940
the constraint that the trust was exposed by susan t

1193
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:30,950
for each i

1194
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:35,570
and that's an LP in two variables x and t because the objective is linear

1195
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:37,780
all the constraints are linear

1196
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,970
it's easy to see that it's equivalent

1197
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:46,900
the easy for example these history to see this is two in this problem if

1198
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,630
you fix x

1199
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:51,940
and you just optimize over t

1200
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:55,590
and that's a very simple LP because there's only one variable

1201
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:59,070
you minimize the subject to m lower bounds on t

1202
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:00,840
it doesn't example

1203
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:51,350
so maximizing the likelihood that maximise the log likelihood

1204
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:52,570
this is

1205
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:57,840
as minimizing

1206
01:19:57,890 --> 01:20:03,490
that's there

1207
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,010
you get

1208
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:24,740
on because as minus sign maximizing this because the minus sign is same as minimizing

1209
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:27,260
this is the function of data

1210
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:33,720
this is of course just

1211
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:38,510
this a quadratic cost function that we had lost time j of data

1212
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:42,320
and so

1213
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:46,370
well i've just shown is that the ordinary least squares our on that

1214
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:48,470
they we worked on the previous lecture

1215
01:20:48,490 --> 01:20:52,700
it's just matter likelihood

1216
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:56,070
this probabilistic model

1217
01:20:56,090 --> 01:21:00,890
i'm assuming this are assuming i calcium errors data

1218
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:10,450
one thing that will actually revisit on

1219
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:15,010
in the next lecture notes is that the value of sigma square it doesn't matter

1220
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:19,910
somehow no matter what the value sigma was squared sequester has be positive number

1221
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:23,950
the variance of the gaussians but no matter what it was great is

1222
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:25,780
so why is this positive number

1223
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,090
the value of data we end up with

1224
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,660
will be the same because

1225
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,700
minimizing this

1226
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:37,220
you get the same value theta no matter what c square so is as if

1227
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:40,550
in this model the value of sigma script doesn't really matter

1228
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:45,370
on wall just just remember that in the next section will come back to this

1229
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:49,220
questions about this

1230
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:50,510
the king

1231
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:53,740
another cup reports your questions you have

1232
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,850
here is

1233
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:51,660
the the first question

1234
01:22:52,930 --> 01:22:54,320
but this is

1235
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,510
because because the problem

1236
01:22:57,570 --> 01:22:59,530
for example

1237
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:06,910
i think you asking about overfitting whether this good model i think

1238
01:23:06,930 --> 01:23:10,410
that's the thing it is distinctive mentioning are on

1239
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:12,240
maybe deeper questions about

1240
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:17,300
learning algorithms that come back to this the come back to later

1241
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:19,530
then we went against no

1242
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:22,220
the question

1243
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:36,410
this an dolls on a linear regression with a probabilistic interpretation

1244
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:41,850
and i'm actually going to use this problem will use this sort of probabilistic interpretation

1245
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:47,180
in order to derive unix learning algorithm which will be on the classification

1246
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:56,340
recall that i said that the regression problems are where the variable y the try

1247
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:59,260
to predict is continuous values

1248
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:05,720
now we should help for first classification problems where the value one trying to predict

1249
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:09,340
what the discrete values can take on only a small number of discrete values in

1250
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:13,370
this case at all for binary classification where on

1251
01:24:13,370 --> 01:24:19,280
why takes on only two values so you come up with classification problems of trying

1252
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:23,990
to do the same medical diagnosis and try to decide based on some features on

1253
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:27,220
the patient has the disease or does not have the disease

1254
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:32,070
or if it holds an example may be trying to decide what this whole cell

1255
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:35,140
in the next six months and the answer is either yes or no either be

1256
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:37,120
so the next six months it will be

1257
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:43,430
i understand examples here but the spam filter is this email spam and answers yes

1258
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:49,130
no or on if you know so my colleagues are interested in predicting whether a

1259
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:54,410
computer system or crash so you have only have to predict what this computing cost

1260
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:58,890
crash the next twenty four hours begins yes or no answer

1261
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:06,140
that's that's why

1262
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,450
and some classihcation problems

1263
01:25:08,450 --> 01:25:13,260
white a fun

1264
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,610
two value zero one that's fine conservation

1265
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:21,570
on so you do one thing could do is take linear regression as described so

1266
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:23,450
far in applied to this problem

1267
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:27,030
so you you know given this data set the straight line to

1268
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:32,190
dean and brian matrix just a case of true i j is equal to the

1269
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:38,090
kernel function is applied to two of my examples

1270
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:58,200
it turns out that for any vectors e this n dimensional which she considers each

1271
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,280
answers kesey

1272
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:05,130
actually this is an export

1273
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:16,100
we should considers the consuls kesey

1274
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:18,710
and by

1275
01:26:18,730 --> 01:26:25,370
definition of matrix multiplication and

1276
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:28,190
and so on

1277
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:36,620
on k i j is the kernel function which time to so that most people

1278
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:42,980
but i assume that k is a valid kernel function so there must exist such

1279
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,180
a social value for phi

1280
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:52,140
on this is the inner product between two feature vector so let me just make

1281
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,120
that inner product the explicit

1282
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:59,450
on some of the elements of the vector and when use five

1283
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:06,080
i subscribe k this to denote the k elements of this vector

1284
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:13,230
like so

1285
01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:19,120
and just giving sums that some of the k

1286
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:40,680
so this may look like this makes me look familiar to to you

1287
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,050
which is just

1288
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:00,500
and therefore

1289
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:02,160
this is the sum of squared

1290
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:06,700
and they must therefore be greater than equal to zero

1291
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:12,330
to stick to do is take a minute and look for all the steps in

1292
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:17,960
make sure you buy them all

1293
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:21,640
if you

1294
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:25,340
o this is all the sea in this that this is a shared the inner

1295
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:29,260
product between the vectors five exciting five exchange

1296
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:35,330
d in product between two vectors is the sum over all the elements of the

1297
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:37,820
vectors of the corresponding

1298
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:48,790
here here is that if you just transpose some of the KB so that's that's

1299
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:50,820
just this is the sum of k of the

1300
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:55,300
OK elements of this vector

1301
01:28:55,350 --> 01:29:02,110
think doesn't make sure it makes sense

1302
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:07,660
the question about the

1303
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:14,610
so to summarize we show was that

1304
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:17,520
on training vectors e

1305
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:19,480
z transpose cave

1306
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:21,650
is greater than equal to zero

1307
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:25,250
and this is one of the standard definitions of the matrix

1308
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:27,480
the matrix k

1309
01:29:27,490 --> 01:29:33,490
be positive semi definite when the matrix is positive case because here

1310
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,890
and just to summarise what we've shown is that

1311
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:40,940
if k

1312
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:43,110
is a on

1313
01:29:43,130 --> 01:29:46,350
valid kernel in other words if k is a function

1314
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:48,900
forced air force there exist

1315
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:54,570
some by such that you know of xi xj is the inner probability five excited

1316
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:55,990
five exchange

1317
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,210
so k is valid kernel we show that the kernel matrix

1318
01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:03,010
must be created must be positive semidefinite

1319
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:05,050
must be positive semi definite

1320
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:09,560
it turns out

1321
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:21,260
it turns that you're the converse holds two so this gives you ten

1322
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:24,940
where a function k is valid

1323
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:26,500
so this is a

1324
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:31,240
this is theorem due to mercer kernels are sometimes also called mercer kernels this means

1325
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,340
the same thing this is a valid kernel

1326
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:41,510
the can exhibit

1327
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,400
k is valid

1328
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:50,630
no this is a mercer kernel

1329
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:57,370
on i e

1330
01:30:57,390 --> 01:31:02,330
you know there exist five such that

1331
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:08,130
one the rules

1332
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:12,250
if and only if

1333
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:25,050
on for any set of m examples and this really means for any set of

1334
01:31:25,050 --> 01:31:28,750
n points not necessarily your training set is just any set of n points you

1335
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:36,910
might choose on it holds true that the kernel matrix

1336
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:45,100
have to OK fine just now

1337
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:48,340
it is

1338
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:50,000
on symmetric

1339
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:51,590
positive semi

1340
01:31:51,640 --> 01:32:06,270
and so i approved only one direction of this result proved that it about kernel

1341
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:12,000
then k is symmetric positive definite but on the conference site and show that it

1342
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,660
turns out that this is necessary and sufficient condition

1343
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:18,030
so the thing use to test

1344
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:21,430
whether any function you might want to choose on

1345
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,750
is a kernel

1346
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:38,950
just as a concrete example of something that is clearly not so

1347
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:40,420
valid kernel

1348
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:42,590
it's a really really good guy

1349
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:46,960
it's even better than your average maximal consistent set

1350
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,150
it doesn't make any existential claims unless is prepared to tell you what which thing

1351
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:59,460
is an example

1352
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,170
and then

1353
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:04,690
in terms of this set

1354
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:07,570
we can construct

1355
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:09,800
the interpretation

1356
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,090
we're after

1357
01:33:13,190 --> 01:33:15,190
we want for the interpretation

1358
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,980
we wanted to mine

1359
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:21,110
that's got to be a nonempty set

1360
01:33:21,110 --> 01:33:25,960
and we want an interpretation function

1361
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:29,200
and we also want evaluation but we can

1362
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:32,240
they that for the moment

1363
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:36,090
what are we going to choose as domain

1364
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:38,270
the ninety cents

1365
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:41,870
and the one we like

1366
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:43,640
is the set

1367
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:57,090
of our primordial double prime whatever it is we're up to now

1368
01:33:57,170 --> 01:34:00,520
the set of all the ground terms of the language white ground

1369
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:04,460
means no variables

1370
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:14,720
in the term

1371
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:22,860
we can be assured that this set is nonempty

1372
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:29,400
i suppose the fact that we threw in at least one constant some point

1373
01:34:29,470 --> 01:34:34,420
if we didn't well let's do it anyway right we we just

1374
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:38,220
do all we have all the domain has to be is not empty and this

1375
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:41,280
is easy to arrange

1376
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:48,280
well i mean we throw in denumerably many constants some points so with real is

1377
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:54,470
that is as good a nonempty set as any

1378
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:57,720
it can serve as the domain for an interpretation

1379
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:03,670
what else does so what does the interpretation function has to have to do

1380
01:35:03,670 --> 01:35:05,460
it has to assign

1381
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:08,940
a function to every function symbol

1382
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:12,400
and then it's can sign relation to every predicate symbols

1383
01:35:12,530 --> 01:35:19,990
how we gonna assign functions to functions and so

1384
01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:22,130
we going we've got

1385
01:35:22,190 --> 01:35:24,300
a function symbol

1386
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:28,110
what is

1387
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:30,920
i of the interpretation of it

1388
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:31,780
going to be

1389
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,260
on this to my

1390
01:35:44,130 --> 01:35:49,010
suppose we got some ground terms t one

1391
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:53,550
appropriately the right number of them

1392
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:57,240
OK these are objects in the domain OK this is it is this is the

1393
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:02,240
double of objects from the domain what is the result of applying

1394
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:04,970
this function to those

1395
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:06,780
it's going to be

1396
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:12,440
t one

1397
01:36:12,460 --> 01:36:14,050
to t

1398
01:36:14,130 --> 01:36:15,670
and this

1399
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:16,820
is the term

1400
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,380
the ground

1401
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:21,530
the language

1402
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:26,320
you just got it from by taking these

1403
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:29,050
symbols these these terms

1404
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:32,630
you which are all ground and applying a function symbol

1405
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:35,200
two so it itself is

1406
01:36:35,260 --> 01:36:39,090
an object in the domain

1407
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:42,050
so we cheat

1408
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,340
wheeler every

1409
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,570
we interpret every function symbol

1410
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:51,440
in effect does itself

1411
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:55,420
so the effect of this is that every

1412
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:01,610
refers to

1413
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:03,760
o denotes

1414
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:09,380
OK the notation

1415
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:12,170
t is t

1416
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:15,340
provided the no variables in t

1417
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:21,030
i haven't said anything about valuations here

1418
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,300
an interpretation with that property

1419
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:31,880
is named after yet another logicians

1420
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:37,010
jack abramoff

1421
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:38,670
belgian i think

1422
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:44,070
abrams here of today

1423
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:47,090
you know in canberra if you're famous you get a street named after you and

1424
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:51,050
if you're a prime minister or something you get a suburb named after

1425
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:54,630
if you

1426
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:58,090
queen adelaide you get a city named after you

1427
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:04,360
around the universe named after the that

1428
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:06,510
the bright universe

1429
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:07,860
is this

1430
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:09,550
the mind

1431
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:14,460
bring universal language is the set of ground terms

1432
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:16,570
however interpretations

1433
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:23,740
is one such that every ground term denotes itself

1434
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:25,470
we could be off

1435
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:27,280
something like

1436
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:30,470
maybe two millimeters it's not so not too easy to

1437
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:32,680
get that whole imprecise

1438
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:35,430
so it's forty centimeters

1439
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:38,890
plus and minus o point two centimetres

1440
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:42,490
so that is an uncertainty of about half a percent

1441
01:38:42,490 --> 01:38:45,530
i have upstairs l square and the square

1442
01:38:45,570 --> 01:38:47,410
and downstairs b

1443
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:51,260
that makes the error there was is a bit complicated

1444
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:53,180
if i stick in the numbers

1445
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,930
then i find the period

1446
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:59,740
which will be very close to one point five six five seconds

1447
01:39:00,910 --> 01:39:03,910
that's taking the exact numbers that i gave you

1448
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:05,300
four l

1449
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:08,820
and i take for g nine point eight and i take the values for b

1450
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:11,970
since i prefer to be on the conservative side

1451
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:16,090
i would love for an uncertainty of about o point o one second

1452
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,390
and i would like to make a measurement

1453
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:21,180
and show you

1454
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:24,490
and show you what we get

1455
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:27,570
so we have here the

1456
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:29,820
the rule

1457
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:32,410
good isolated

1458
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:34,760
small angle

1459
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:39,430
we can be a little bit rougher make it a little larger

1460
01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:41,470
stop at first

1461
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:46,240
all started when it stops at my side it is always easy do

1462
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:05,340
look on the button

1463
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:08,320
way was in the air

1464
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:09,820
i mean isn't it

1465
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:10,640
that's us

1466
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:13,050
complex systems can be so easily

1467
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:14,820
dealt with in physics

1468
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:17,720
fifteen what is the point seven one

1469
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,550
my reaction time

1470
01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:20,800
it's always point

1471
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:27,010
one second thirty agreement is absolutely fantastic

1472
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,740
i'll show you once you've done this

1473
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:32,200
with your

1474
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:35,970
you can now apply this knowledge

1475
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:39,030
way more interesting

1476
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:44,140
and that is the

1477
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:45,720
the hope

1478
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:49,740
will take the

1479
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:57,050
and we're going to do the same thing for the whole of

1480
01:40:57,090 --> 01:41:01,950
and the system the approach will be exactly identical

1481
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:05,680
we have been through the rule of law

1482
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:06,660
this is the

1483
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:11,320
this is point p

1484
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,050
this is the centre of mass

1485
01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:16,340
it's not like this

1486
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:18,640
a little later

1487
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:20,640
the centre of mass will be here

1488
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:23,120
and this angle will be data

1489
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,050
the mass of the rule of

1490
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:29,410
it is and it has radius are

1491
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:31,910
i know will be forces sort of point p

1492
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:34,030
but i couldn't care less about

1493
01:41:34,070 --> 01:41:37,620
all i worry about is this and g

1494
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:39,740
in this position vector r p

1495
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:42,760
and the whole thing goes

1496
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:46,680
i'm going to get that to work

1497
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:49,140
about the point p

1498
01:41:49,180 --> 01:41:51,890
equals and g

1499
01:41:51,950 --> 01:41:55,820
and i'll fill filled in for this immediately radius are

1500
01:41:55,820 --> 01:41:59,360
times the sign of fatah

1501
01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:05,740
and that must be equal minus the moment of inertia about point p

1502
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:10,200
thank fate about

1503
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:13,450
what is the moment of inertia about point b

1504
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:17,030
well that's the moment of inertia of rotation about the centre of mass

1505
01:42:17,050 --> 01:42:20,620
let m are square the the parallel axis theorem

1506
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:24,490
moment of inertia for rotation about this axis

1507
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:30,510
it's clearly square because all the mass is distributed at the conference a distance are

1508
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:34,450
so it is the summation of all the masses times the radius squared

1509
01:42:34,450 --> 01:42:38,140
so this is going to be m are screened

1510
01:42:38,180 --> 01:42:39,590
plus and minus grades

1511
01:42:39,590 --> 01:42:45,680
so that's two and are screen

1512
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:48,550
so we bring this to one side

1513
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:52,280
so we're going to get data available dots

1514
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:56,860
g are

1515
01:42:56,870 --> 01:43:02,140
we make this the small angle approximation provided by IP

1516
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,490
well zero

1517
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:07,620
the involvement of oscillation data was exactly that same solution

1518
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:09,450
now we get as a

1519
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:11,840
period we get two pi

1520
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:14,260
times square root

1521
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:17,840
i p

1522
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:20,280
divided by are

1523
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:22,490
i p

1524
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:25,590
two and are created

1525
01:43:25,670 --> 01:43:30,700
he i'd be divided by MG not be but now we have and are

1526
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:32,590
cited by

1527
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:35,240
and we are

1528
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,620
it's real

1529
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:41,340
and the complex number this particular complex number

1530
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:45,030
comes out so one we call that i'm not going to write this down because

1531
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:51,610
it's sort of pompous and takes too long but it is a complex valued function

1532
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:53,180
the real variable

1533
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,320
got that

1534
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:59,770
up to now we study real functions of real variables but now real valued functions

1535
01:43:59,770 --> 01:44:05,620
of real variables of the kind calculus is concerned with the now it's complex valued

1536
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:09,590
the variable is real

1537
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:11,340
but the output

1538
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:14,970
the value of the function is a complex number

1539
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:17,480
in general

1540
01:44:17,490 --> 01:44:21,410
such a function

1541
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:22,780
well maybe a better

1542
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:24,760
complex valued

1543
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:27,770
about about complex valued function

1544
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:32,620
of a real variable is changed the name of the variable fees always the real

1545
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:37,010
we don't i don't think we have complex time yet although i'm sure there will

1546
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:38,390
be some day

1547
01:44:38,410 --> 01:44:44,870
the next einstein appears complex valued function of a real variable t

1548
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:49,730
in general would look like this

1549
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:54,020
he goes in and what comes out well a complex number

1550
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:58,010
which i would then have to write this way in other words the real part

1551
01:44:58,010 --> 01:44:59,530
depends on t

1552
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:02,320
and the imaginary part depends upon t

1553
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:06,470
so it's more a general function looks like

1554
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:11,470
a general complex valued function this is just a special case of it

1555
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:15,410
variable is a different name with you but the first function is coast would be

1556
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:16,750
cosine t

1557
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,490
and the second function will be signed t

1558
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:23,490
so my question is how do you differentiate such a thing as well

1559
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:27,930
i'm not going to fuss over this you know one can go to the death

1560
01:45:28,110 --> 01:45:32,720
the general definition is an with deltas and what not but

1561
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:35,220
the end result of a perfectly

1562
01:45:35,230 --> 01:45:40,060
fine definition is you differentiated by differentiating each component

1563
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:43,850
what's the reason you don't have to work so very hard because this is the

1564
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:48,120
real variable and all i already know what it means to differentiate the function of

1565
01:45:48,130 --> 01:45:51,080
real variables like you write it this way

1566
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:53,220
if that the derivative

1567
01:45:53,230 --> 01:45:57,450
of you plus i abbreviated that way

1568
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:01,650
this means the derivative with respect to whatever the very decided to tell you what

1569
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:05,760
variable and these functions were was i i

1570
01:46:05,770 --> 01:46:08,780
i don't have to tell you what i'm differentiating with respect to

1571
01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:10,570
it's whatever was there

1572
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:11,770
as you can see

1573
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:14,670
and the answer is it will be the derivative of u

1574
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:17,650
plus i times the derivative

1575
01:46:17,730 --> 01:46:21,940
differentiate it just the way you would have these were the components available lots of

1576
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:24,370
a motion vector e

1577
01:46:24,390 --> 01:46:26,070
you we get the velocity

1578
01:46:26,070 --> 01:46:31,860
by differentiating each component separately and that's what you're doing here

1579
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:37,250
now the importance of that is that it least tells me

1580
01:46:37,290 --> 01:46:41,390
what it is i have to check when i checked this formula but so let's

1581
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:45,610
do it now that we know what this is

1582
01:46:45,670 --> 01:46:51,760
we know how to differentiate the function let's actually differentiated that that's fortunately is by

1583
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:54,390
far the easiest part of the whole process

1584
01:46:54,440 --> 01:47:03,970
so let's do it

1585
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:07,430
so what's the derivative well let's go back to t

1586
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:09,140
our generic variable

1587
01:47:09,190 --> 01:47:11,120
i want to emphasise that these are

1588
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:14,190
in text that these functions

1589
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:18,320
when we write this function is the data will almost never be the variable

1590
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:22,830
outside of these notes on complex numbers it will only be time or something like

1591
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:29,750
that or x neutral variable like x so what's the derivative of EDI data

1592
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:33,190
i'm hoping that it will turn out to be all i need to the i

1593
01:47:33,190 --> 01:47:34,000
th data

1594
01:47:34,930 --> 01:47:39,370
that the yellow law may be true just as the green one was OK let's

1595
01:47:39,370 --> 01:47:40,340
calculate it

1596
01:47:40,470 --> 01:47:43,110
it's the derivative with respect to

1597
01:47:43,170 --> 01:47:49,610
unfortunately i can convert these the data has been updated cities

1598
01:47:49,690 --> 01:47:52,190
so the OK

1599
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,480
times the cosine

1600
01:47:55,090 --> 01:47:57,300
was i sin t

1601
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:01,990
and was that well the derivative of cosine t

1602
01:48:02,030 --> 01:48:06,110
differentiating the real and imaginary parts separately and up

1603
01:48:06,170 --> 01:48:09,050
it's a negative sign t

1604
01:48:09,090 --> 01:48:11,690
plus all i

1605
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:14,780
times cos t

1606
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:21,740
let's factor out of because it says

1607
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:27,740
is five factorize the i would like to get

1608
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:33,260
the first is the real part of what's left we'll be cosine t

1609
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:36,000
how about the imaginary or

1610
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:40,060
you see it will be i signed because

1611
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:43,920
i times i is then gives me the negative ones

1612
01:48:43,970 --> 01:48:45,100
what's that

1613
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:46,420
the acting

1614
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:47,770
guarantee that the

1615
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:52,070
getting the best case for the impression that it is going to be getting the

1616
01:48:52,070 --> 01:48:55,860
best for the at the money

1617
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:59,230
so everyone participates in the option all together

1618
01:48:59,270 --> 01:49:00,900
however the problem is that

1619
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:03,300
since everyone who's using different

1620
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:04,710
revenue models

1621
01:49:04,730 --> 01:49:09,050
we have to convert all those bits and all the one

1622
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:10,670
four like

1623
01:49:10,690 --> 01:49:12,820
how do we do this conversion

1624
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:16,130
is an open problem no one really knows how to do this kind of

1625
01:49:16,130 --> 01:49:18,710
so currently what people typically do is

1626
01:49:18,730 --> 01:49:23,000
they enforce that you have to everyone has to be on the same sort of

1627
01:49:24,050 --> 01:49:27,520
and this is obviously not what necessary one

1628
01:49:27,550 --> 01:49:31,750
so converting the one given a common denomination is the challenge

1629
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:34,750
it's still an unsolved problem

1630
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:36,800
so that

1631
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:43,250
this system close on the background for online advertising you got what online advertising sort

1632
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:45,320
of what actors in the system

1633
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:48,920
what are the different models with different advertising settings

1634
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:53,420
what is ad exchange and all of these how did in fact features and now

1635
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:54,570
we can move on

1636
01:49:54,590 --> 01:49:56,840
the statistical aspects of the problems

1637
01:49:56,840 --> 01:50:02,610
and this the but they are here to discuss the fundamental statistical problem that

1638
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:08,150
that shows up in competition

1639
01:50:08,150 --> 01:50:09,860
i will now go

1640
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:14,610
a little bit more mathematical and try to find some mathematical problem

1641
01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:19,900
based on the introduction that the beginning

1642
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:24,960
so first again and start with the display advertising so before i go

1643
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:26,570
into the side

1644
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:32,800
i would like to mention that some of the problems which here

1645
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:37,840
there has been progress made on those problems recently there are several papers that either

1646
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:42,590
under submission or have been published in those references are not on the

1647
01:50:42,590 --> 01:50:43,670
tutorial so

1648
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:48,440
after our tutorial is or provide a link to those references on our website which

1649
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:53,630
can download but still getting them back to this example the new york times health

1650
01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:58,710
page netflix that so clearly the ad is not relevant to the

1651
01:50:58,790 --> 01:51:04,520
the content of the page and really the main goal here is netflix targeting a

1652
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:08,290
certain section of the population school they probably want to reach out to a certain

1653
01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:13,750
section of the population and that's the reason why this is here

1654
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:17,580
you know that's that's what is called display advertising is one thing to note is

1655
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:20,360
in display advertising

1656
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:25,250
the publisher takes risk

1657
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:29,220
so with publishers pay per impression so there is no risk and publisher side of

1658
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:36,150
the by the advertiser so one question to ask would be the war

1659
01:51:36,170 --> 01:51:39,440
why would the advertisers take the risk doesn't even work

1660
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:43,690
that have not been a lot of studies done two

1661
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:48,730
and so this question concretely there have been some exploratory analysis done like for instance

1662
01:51:48,730 --> 01:51:53,650
there was an article in the harvard business review according the study done by con

1663
01:51:53,670 --> 01:51:56,770
score when they

1664
01:51:56,840 --> 01:52:00,820
looked at users who were exposed to and add-on users were not exposed to that

1665
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:04,840
then they did some exploratory analysis and found that the revenue for people who got

1666
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:09,520
exposed to that was much higher than those who were not exposed to but you

1667
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:13,530
know that's a relational study it's not you can't assert causality mister

1668
01:52:13,550 --> 01:52:19,250
maybe they got exposed to in that particular kind of hardware problem particular age group

1669
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:23,920
and you know more than those kind of so so that you can't sort causality

1670
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:27,440
based on such studies however recently there have been a study

1671
01:52:31,020 --> 01:52:32,880
using experimental design

1672
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:37,710
and this paper is going to come out in economics journal so it was done

1673
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:43,360
by some colleagues yahoo so what they did was they did for the study and

1674
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:48,670
called it the highlight of rules that they were

1675
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:51,270
the large

1676
01:52:51,710 --> 01:52:59,030
and the match to use records from the whole database with the retailers data is

1677
01:52:59,090 --> 01:53:02,590
and then they found a bunch of matches matches were done based on

1678
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:04,400
it is

1679
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:05,810
the area

1680
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:18,250
you know

1681
01:53:18,270 --> 01:53:22,680
of error

1682
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:30,230
get rid of

1683
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:56,660
he worked

1684
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:16,490
all right

1685
01:55:32,580 --> 01:55:36,680
all three

1686
01:55:50,990 --> 01:55:55,780
she is

1687
01:56:10,270 --> 01:56:14,460
six the

1688
01:56:35,150 --> 01:56:53,880
so far

1689
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:08,850
we are

1690
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:14,010
the model

1691
01:57:28,180 --> 01:57:38,160
i think that

1692
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:41,620
and if

1693
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:54,270
and that

1694
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:59,850
you are

1695
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:23,030
and yet

1696
01:58:40,460 --> 01:58:41,830
very easy

1697
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:44,620
you are

1698
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:52,910
four days

1699
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:51,660
he held

1700
02:00:20,290 --> 02:00:24,000
it's getting on the

1701
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:46,710
we have

1702
02:01:52,690 --> 02:01:55,020
here are

1703
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:57,000
are all

1704
02:02:14,710 --> 02:02:17,050
these are the

1705
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:24,350
well the

1706
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:28,790
you really

1707
02:02:35,690 --> 02:02:42,360
by these people

1708
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:55,260
i one

1709
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:35,130
i did not work well well

1710
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:44,460
three hundred

1711
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:01,490
he went

1712
02:04:12,470 --> 02:04:16,780
do you

1713
02:04:32,350 --> 02:04:33,600
what you are

1714
02:04:35,530 --> 02:04:39,660
he was

1715
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:49,320
for that's all

1716
02:05:03,430 --> 02:05:07,720
he really

1717
02:05:09,870 --> 02:05:11,100
right of

1718
02:05:47,490 --> 02:05:50,770
one or years

1719
02:06:06,860 --> 02:06:08,740
or a

1720
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:50,390
and one

1721
02:06:50,410 --> 02:06:53,120
i very

1722
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:58,890
where you are on the

1723
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:09,410
want to be able to

1724
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:11,310
what we

1725
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:35,080
three so

1726
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:46,800
here and there are no

1727
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:09,890
he is

1728
02:08:13,450 --> 02:08:17,930
or i see might three

1729
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:25,200
i i not

1730
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:37,770
one reason

1731
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:50,600
o thing and they

1732
02:08:58,600 --> 02:09:01,160
the school

1733
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:56,420
in the future
