1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
so we can celebrate yet

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,440
we have to wait

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,020
civic party

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,300
there is always a little bit of an issue about

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,760
the direction of the a

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,250
i will explain to you how the convention goes but

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,820
it really is not

8
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,510
so crucial because lens always helps you

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,870
to find

10
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,970
the direction of the EMF but if we are trying to be

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,410
if this is

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,850
my conducting

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,310
and if i catch

14
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,960
a flat surface to this if i did that

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,060
and if i go around a closed loop integral you don't pl

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,450
violators doesn't county which we have to go i can go clockwise i can go

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,000
we will then do the same thing that we did before with MP's law

18
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,560
apply the right

19
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,540
and corkscrew rule

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,000
and that is that if you mark around clockwise

21
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,470
will be in the blackboards

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,480
perpendicular to the blackboard perpendicular to the surface

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,840
and if you go counterclockwise

24
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,920
and the a

25
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,520
welcome put you

26
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,170
the surface

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,170
it doesn't have to be flat

28
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,700
it can be flat nothing wrong with it

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,440
but they can also be a bag attached to it

30
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,780
as we also had earlier i have here

31
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,580
close conducting wire

32
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,350
and i could put surface right here but i can also make it had like

33
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,010
this is perfectly fine

34
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,680
nothing wrong with that

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,550
that's a open surface attached to this

36
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,800
that's fine

37
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,830
you have a choice

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,060
and the convention was the eighties then exactly the same

39
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,430
if you go clockwise

40
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,580
then the DNA will be in this direction

41
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,030
using the right hand corkscrew

42
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,770
locally here if you went counterclockwise

43
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,200
the able to flip over

44
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:14,140
so what is now a recipe that you have to follow

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,700
you have a circuit

46
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,320
electric circuit that determines then

47
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,730
you know of course you can take a look anywhere in space but that's not

48
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,710
the we need to be taken into your

49
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,740
and so you define the look first

50
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,050
then you define direction in which you want to march around that circuit

51
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,250
you attach

52
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,020
an open service to that

53
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,090
closed loop

54
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,440
and you can determine on the entire surface

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,000
the integral of e dot

56
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,870
everywhere on that surface locally you know to be a local you know to be

57
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,120
the reintegration and you get the magnetic flux

58
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,780
and then if you know to try change of the magnetic flux

59
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,720
then you know the EMF

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,420
if you go around in this

61
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,250
and you measure every really electric fields then the integral of e dot

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,800
if you go around the loop will give you the same answer that connects the

63
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,520
the magnetic

64
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,180
flux change

65
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,630
it's connected

66
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,500
which the integral of e dot o when you go around

67
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,750
have a minus sign to come

68
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,530
how come it doesn't matter

69
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,620
whether you choose a flat surface

70
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,720
whether you choose a bag

71
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,440
i think of

72
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,280
magnetic field lines

73
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,570
as a flow of water

74
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,670
if you like that or flow of air

75
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,050
it is clear

76
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,960
that if there is some kind of the flow of air through these openings that

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,970
don't come out somewhere so it always comes out of the surface

78
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,110
and therefore

79
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,790
you are free to choose that so you always because surface

80
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,740
that is

81
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,700
the best one for you

82
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,600
all this looks very complicated

83
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,060
but in practice it really isn't

84
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,810
because you know is always the conducting wire

85
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,660
in your circuit

86
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,050
and the minus sign

87
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,290
it's never an issue

88
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,690
because you always know was lens law

89
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,200
in which direction

90
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,430
the EMF is

91
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,800
in fact when i solve these problems

92
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,280
i don't even look at the minus sign i ignored completely

93
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,340
and if i calculate the magnetic flux change and i always know in which direction

94
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,210
the current is so i don't even look at the minus sign

95
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,010
now i want to show you demonstration which is

96
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,410
very much like

97
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,520
try to do

98
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,460
i have here solenoid

99
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,480
we've seen this one before

100
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,780
we can generate quite a

101
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,570
magnetic field was that

102
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,480
and we're going to put around the solenoid

103
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,420
one look

104
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,170
like we had here

105
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,370
like fire they did never going to close to switch

106
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,230
so we're going to build this magnetic field and we going to see the current

107
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,970
in that

108
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,610
and so if we look we make a cross section straight through here

109
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,030
then it will look as follows

110
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,740
and you see here

111
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,800
the solenoid thirty magnetic field is really confined to the solenoid magnetic field outside the

112
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,780
solenoid is we discussed earlier is almost zero

113
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,950
so is only a magnetic field right here keep that in mind in what follows

114
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,840
and now we're going to put a wire around

115
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,030
was an interim there

116
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,740
if the magnetic field

117
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,320
comes out of the board

118
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,260
and is growing

119
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,160
the current will flow in this direction

120
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,830
lens law

121
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,590
if it is decreasing

122
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,320
the current will go in the opposite direction

123
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,260
now keep in mind that the magnetic flux

124
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,060
through this surface

125
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,760
my surface which i attached to this

126
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,420
closed loop that magnetic flux

127
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,230
remains the same

128
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,280
when i make the movies big when i make the loop very crooked

129
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,890
like so

130
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,000
because the magnetic flux

131
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,840
is only confined

132
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,550
building blocks for those

133
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:32,570
for these images and you can see actually they're pretty simple patterns that not specific

134
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:38,050
instances of sharp high-resolution eyes or nose are so on wheels

135
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,740
so these become the building blocks for

136
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,150
here's another example so

137
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,860
no we have to represent images how do we represent our images we basically take

138
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:58,090
the building blocks and look at every single specific image look at how many english

139
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,720
a slanted line dispatched does this image have

140
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,550
so we give it to frequency counter probably normalizer saw and this

141
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,720
and this is the way of the the

142
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,240
of the dictionary becomes the representation of the image

143
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,110
again this is very analogous to the text document research

144
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,740
people have been using

145
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,280
so now we have seen how to put these images through the global dictionary into

146
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,030
the into the bag of words let's look at

147
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,380
the core

148
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:39,680
into this algorithm are these models probabilistic models and here i'm going to use

149
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:46,550
two case studies one is the earliest paper that have used the bag of words

150
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:53,630
model representation and use use the naive bayes classifier to do very successful recognition another

151
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:59,010
one is actually this series of papers that built upon this recent events in text

152
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:05,880
that rigour actually gives a good introduction to so these probabilistic and semantic

153
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:13,030
and as is PLS and the latent dirichlet allocation LDA models so

154
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,820
here are just some some notation what we're going to call is that we're going

155
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:26,030
to call w patch in the image and and w actually also indicates

156
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,610
dictionary vocabulary this patch of the image comes from so

157
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:37,320
it will be represented as a vector of let's say are dictionaries three hundred number

158
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,340
of vocabularies and vector of three hundred and then let's say the hundred fifty s

159
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,010
is what this patch comes from so there's a one here and the rest is

160
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:54,470
zero so this is our basic description of the image patch and the border w

161
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,740
is the collection of these patches so you can imagine as as the matrix and

162
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,700
in text text community we call this a document ending vision we call this an

163
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,650
image and then

164
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,740
and then we have the is

165
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:20,400
d j indicates the j document in image collection c is our category label and

166
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,800
z is

167
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,180
what we will see later on the latent topics you come across in all these

168
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:36,490
so the simplest case is the naive bayes model that tucker and her colleagues proposed

169
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:43,130
and very successfully in fact that the model is very simple what we have is

170
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,280
that for every class

171
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:54,470
models a bicycle we have we represent probability this way the likelihood would be given

172
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,510
this class

173
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:01,130
the likelihood of the image and then we have a prior probability for the for

174
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,050
the class

175
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:08,590
and then to even simplify our lives better what they do is they

176
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,380
assume independence of all patches within this image so what you end up with this

177
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,990
is actually a product of the likelihood of each patch given this class

178
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,840
so we expand this into here and then

179
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,120
then the system

180
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,560
react very strongly will going to residents

181
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,830
build up huge amplitude because you keep feeding in

182
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,510
waves and they keep coming back to the whole thing starts building up

183
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,730
and that's the idea of resonance

184
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,890
and residence normal modes one and the same that's the normal mode of these

185
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,390
strings fixed

186
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,450
both ends we also referred to them sometimes as

187
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,700
natural frequencies

188
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,320
these points here

189
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,430
the name

190
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,980
they are called notes

191
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,260
this is no

192
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,910
this is an old

193
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,210
and these points he also here and here are the ones that have the largest

194
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,890
amplitude i called and nodes

195
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:13,770
and i call the time is very strange

196
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,620
recall the bike about is this

197
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,860
so the boundary condition leads to discrete values

198
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,840
of the

199
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,770
resonance frequencies

200
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,840
and if this recording mechanics we will call these i can solutions and i can

201
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,910
so if you want to write down now

202
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,180
the situation for you and smote

203
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,760
in its most general form

204
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,050
then you will get

205
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,340
the function of x and y

206
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,730
in the and small

207
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,700
would have its own amplitude

208
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,490
they and whatever that is

209
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,330
you can take that for different

210
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,680
values of and

211
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,470
and then you have to sign

212
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,000
and by

213
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,600
i'm excited by l

214
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,460
during the cosine

215
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,360
of omega and c

216
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,100
meets the boundary conditions

217
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,230
four two fixed ends

218
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,270
any linear sort position

219
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:21,800
any combination various values of nancy and and various values of a that satisfy

220
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:28,140
the wave equation so this strain can simultaneously oscillate in a whole series of these

221
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,620
normal modes and when we do music next thursday you'll see that actually i will

222
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,800
demonstrate that to you

223
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,550
what i want to show you now is that if i

224
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,390
take a strange

225
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,040
and again assistance

226
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,750
even though it has spring-like qualities we will treat it as a string

227
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,020
then i will show you that if i drive this at the end of proper

228
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,220
i can

229
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,500
it generates the residences and i can make you see the normal modes

230
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,270
always willing to assist this time you're dying last time also write but

231
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,680
he called on the battle then

232
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,890
holding your hand firmly

233
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,750
just walk back at nothing

234
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,720
just walk back or back you tension on their OK that's fine

235
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,680
so i'm not going to wiggle this is really a fixed and you will see

236
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,890
when i read residence at my hand is hardly moving at all keep bumping waves

237
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,730
in and they keep coming back at me in the amplitude build up

238
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,750
and then i have to search for these resonances and when it what i know

239
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,960
you'll see why i know i feel it in my stomach i feel it in

240
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,790
my time here

241
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,430
in my hands and my whole body knows i present

242
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,250
you'll see that

243
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,140
there we go this is the

244
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,830
this is the lowest mode

245
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,360
this is an equals one

246
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,940
the nodes of my hand is hardly move at all

247
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,710
and they all fall

248
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,160
practical reasons is really a fixed

249
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,080
you get that solutions

250
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,750
i will now try to

251
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,000
find the second harmonic

252
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,600
which would end up then and a as a node in the middle

253
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,830
in addition to nodes at the end

254
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,440
that it

255
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,050
and again when they then resonance which is the normal mode noted in my hand

256
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,130
is hardly moving

257
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,220
what do i think really no i'm always

258
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,300
i can try to third one

259
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,970
in which case you would see two nodes in the middle

260
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,200
with the and

261
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,310
this is the third one

262
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,570
good today and why not

263
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,880
very clearly points then still

264
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,520
normal modes

265
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,260
i'm not supposed to do that

266
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,370
all men

267
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,410
reporting my demonstration

268
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,260
now i will try to generate the highest frequency normal mode i can so you

269
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,790
can't the number of nodes in the middle

270
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,240
and if you find five and that's the six

271
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,150
you make

272
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,890
i think i can do that

273
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,320
but it's not so easy to get very high frequencies so you do nothing because

274
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,200
you would really ruin it

275
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,010
get him getting there

276
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,830
get it going to the art of mike i don't know

277
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,470
you should have moved to see

278
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,160
it wasn't your fault tried again

279
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,360
i can not arise in the got

280
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,550
and the going resonance can please count how many features

281
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:47,410
i counted twelve nodes in the middle

282
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,140
what's your name

283
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,030
all right so this is the way it works that you see

284
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,210
normal mode

285
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,970
it's either result

286
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,670
which will be standing waves

287
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,830
the demonstration speaks for itself

288
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,690
i have here a rubber hose

289
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,770
which we are going to excite interface harmonic

290
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,200
let's see how that works whether we were close

291
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,150
anyone touches table

292
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,120
there than the tension changes and immediately of course the

293
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,570
the resonance frequency changes because the resonance frequency

294
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,980
notice has this thing it

295
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,450
one which chased different it's not bad

296
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,830
so now i will

297
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,260
throughout this one for you

298
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,960
because you

299
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,420
i have no idea here

300
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,370
that's what is happening is going like this is going too fast for you

301
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,480
so i make it easy on

302
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,760
turn the lights off thank you

303
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,990
so i'm going to struggle between u

304
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,500
and then

305
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,470
i can more or less make the

306
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,030
rope stands still

307
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,980
but i can also offset the frequency of my strobe light a little bit

308
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,060
so that you actually zero

309
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,800
move very slowly

310
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,920
so i can purposely

311
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,830
give the

312
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,800
strobe light a slightly different frequencies

313
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,520
so that's what i'm doing now

314
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,830
this is just like

315
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,720
so you have no doubt anymore but fact

316
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,960
no doubts

317
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,130
that indeed

318
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,960
i think we can actually

319
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,150
so next

320
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,510
speaking in my experience has

321
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,240
it's not for

322
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,640
community but only everybody

323
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,450
most of you

324
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:50,450
we're using his contribution to facebook so

325
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,950
friend suggests we should by fifty percent last year

326
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:00,900
because of his way to the peace talks classes

327
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,000
finnish pg

328
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,030
and that is very visible

329
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,030
searching the area of

330
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,280
the social

331
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,890
network analysis

332
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:17,850
so many times and so have joined a facebook and so

333
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,470
but the difference this

334
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,350
but if you have anything that you find in dollars

335
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,880
so how we deal with

336
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:42,190
it is structured and unstructured data that we have

337
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:47,350
it's also just beginning

338
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:52,460
this is a major component of all the data we have work with they can

339
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,910
it all together and go to use

340
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:02,440
the house is a kind of the a product built around and then in the

341
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,270
limit are also died in two

342
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:11,850
work the most which is mountain is the front suggested about how the uses of

343
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:17,180
the relationships between people to make suggestions

344
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:23,970
so this is this is the first about the work is going here

345
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,580
so this is a graph showing

346
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,130
how many active users are about to start

347
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,060
i think that the people have sort of

348
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,860
i got tired of sending out press releases about how many millions of users are

349
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:42,580
the five million number is real now it's still going up you say can say

350
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,240
with the numbers

351
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,490
this page is huge sort of still going in the right

352
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,050
and so those million-plus users

353
00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:00,270
there are also very active in the accounts of all the time it was for

354
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,090
a month or have them come every day

355
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,730
and all the people contributing a huge amount of

356
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:14,330
and sharing with friends and so there is over thirty billion pieces of content shared

357
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,770
this is the thing that i think

358
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:23,230
links now we're doing this check the places

359
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,180
this is actually the largest photo-sharing website now

360
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,710
it's so surpassed all the exclusively for those websites like flickr go

361
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,210
and currently there is over three billion photos being uploaded every month

362
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:46,680
and finally this is able what to connect with third-party developers

363
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:53,110
and not only are the other million websites he is one

364
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,440
don't have this sort like buttons all over the place but it's also the RDF

365
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,960
is the game

366
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,900
that is on the second the people

367
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:14,330
doing this by spending all the time that he began

368
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:20,260
in two thousand eight was only after by the data

369
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:26,240
not to say september two thousand ten which six months ago

370
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,210
the see almost hundred by today

371
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,800
you can plot the the trajectory imagine where it is today

372
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,740
it's big

373
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:42,900
so also to give you some idea of the scale of things work with you

374
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,810
can imagine all the problem is that you can use

375
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,530
one of the things that have happened in fact is the trend towards more and

376
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,970
more structured data

377
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,570
so if you go back and look at what people like two years ago in

378
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,010
two thousand eight

379
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,670
it was all this freeform text

380
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,700
these things are all links

381
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,150
but didn't really go to and is located just want a page about that specific

382
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,270
and this is what you get people make spelling mistakes in the typing all kinds

383
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:22,690
of things that are exactly the same people are expressing their own ways

384
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:28,130
so international viewers if anything better than to go for more structured

385
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,210
with the profile like

386
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,140
is this and you can see that there is no almost no

387
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:39,290
the act and is no one's place can then

388
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,950
well there but the most fact it's all very structured and things are linked to

389
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,220
other entities that are

390
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,720
just to highlight a couple of examples

391
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,130
i say

392
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,650
science university

393
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,920
and this is the link to some page about university and everybody on the planet

394
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,980
a student that for all of us are never in the field of information in

395
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,780
the profile is now similarly to the set of

396
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,420
similarly here

397
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,710
this movie

398
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,790
which i got like

399
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,580
i actually like this on IMDB

400
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,010
and the building this for my profile in related to

401
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:29,390
it has like that they can be extracted that a that

402
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:38,130
what are structured and we're not going to a few examples of

403
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,870
what these things that you don't

404
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,700
typically like famous tech today

405
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,540
when right so there

406
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,850
two different objects

407
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,530
that some way

408
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:54,530
so the most obvious way is the first principal every

409
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,330
friendship edges connecting to people

410
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,480
has some innovations things like who created it

411
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,690
what i missed a

412
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,760
but then so all the other

413
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,640
content if it also has

414
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:18,120
imposes some relationship on and so for the tags for instance example a person who

415
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,950
and then also the for the two

416
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,170
the owner of

417
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:28,460
and if you like the page and first that is forming a link from u

418
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,520
to that page

419
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,640
and now they don't like the pages of in this larger sets

420
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,270
people have in common

421
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,220
and so

422
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,520
we think about this

423
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,920
well the same thing as is just

424
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,330
all this structure does once you

425
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,460
all of these things are known to have a but there are no pages and

426
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,710
people and

427
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,150
and then there different sorts of edges in the different edges first have different meaning

428
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,870
semantics to them and their and in different ways

429
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:05,880
and when it comes down to it's all this is what a huge that with

430
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,450
so that's how would think constructed

431
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,210
was 1 way I can prove

432
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:18,970
we have a proposition last week that gave a sufficient condition for a direction to

433
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,870
be a descent direction and then my remember what that was

434
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:29,190
the direction is always going to be a descent direction if it satisfies case

435
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,750
that what you mean by that that the

436
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:40,790
it matters but yes it makes the corrected the product of the gradient of this

437
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:47,970
that something with gradient related anyway to borrow a phrase from the frequency so

438
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,850
it might

439
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:57,780
if my direction makes a negative inner product with the gradient there is going to

440
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:04,300
do it must be a descent direction so I need to prove that the transposes

441
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,010
it is less than 0

442
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:15,170
as I need to show you that that's somewhat straightforward what that it that

443
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,930
1 of the Board's here and we try something

444
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:27,980
the or

445
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:45,340
of the slave Woody Allen version of the

446
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:58,560
OK everybody see the bottom of the screen that you are interesting part so thank

447
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:09,130
you or to watch this so by definition I will have that my new direction

448
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:23,100
that would could gradient is minus the taking the transpose minus the gradient and the

449
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:30,060
inverse of the Hessian times the great right now let's

450
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,280
this would be

451
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,580
negative under what conditions

452
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:41,330
is the inverse is positive definite

453
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,820
right if the universe is positive definite this is going to be negative about this

454
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,970
whole thing is going to be

455
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:51,020
OK will we said that they tested positive definite

456
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:57,050
the largest I show you that the Hessian is positive definite if and only if

457
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:02,510
its inverse is positive and that's really easy so now I need to show in

458
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:09,190
order to complete the proof that this will definitely true here the age of x

459
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,670
inverse is speaker

460
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:19,830
but now why is that so what's this so I know that h effect existing

461
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:25,290
in the genetic any vector v there's a picture of

462
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:31,540
and then I know that for instance I know that there was less than

463
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:38,870
yes it what's the effect of being a direct interest is equal to

464
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,560
a heroin and we do this

465
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:59,450
0 yeah yeah meeting inverse community in which takes effect of in and that's true

466
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,070
and then this I know it's part is strictly positive

467
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,710
I want to prove this

468
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:13,590
yeah this is equal to this and this is positive this is strictly positive because

469
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:19,570
this is just this vector here with the Hessian it with the same vector

470
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:28,530
and so that's the 1st OK so but now what I showed you can if

471
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:33,130
applied shall use the new direction is the direction decrease I haven't shown you get

472
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,740
my point is going to have a better objective function right

473
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,000
everybody see the difference

474
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:48,910
right announced talk about rates of convergence and this is actually this is important not

475
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,250
just for this lecture but actually for the rest of the costs because

476
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:59,350
we improve a lot of things about that I prove for a lot of algorithms

477
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:07,070
that they convert you might think industrial on and convergence and so when for example

478
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:12,110
suppose the convergence rate suppose I got this wall I'd like to walk through this

479
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:17,790
wall of the following released at a distance from the wall is

480
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:22,870
of 1 over square root of k

481
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,630
how many iterations is going to take me

482
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:30,950
so clearly exposed to 0 as K goes to infinity case that distance is 1

483
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:37,520
over square root of k positive statements element in say 10 to the minus the

484
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:41,450
of the

485
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:46,580
whose home up to your name from credit

486
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:58,520
granted licenses community is 10 to the 6th and I don't have time over a

487
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,730
million iterations OK located on the other hand

488
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:13,670
right if they 1 tends to decay originality iterations is

489
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:21,650
yes 3 3 and so is when 2 different iterations at different rates of convergence

490
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,580
so will say that this series of a of k converges much slower this year

491
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:35,480
but we have general classes of convergence and so let's talk about that permit so

492
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:46,310
suppose I have here

493
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:50,910
so I have a series specified

494
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:57,190
OK and say that converges to some s

495
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,930
OK and this is just the latest scalars

496
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,690
so that also a

497
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,690
that my series

498
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:14,760
exhibits linear convergence in the limit is high goes to infinity of as survive plus

499
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:23,340
might as well over test is

500
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:28,430
equal the sum of delta that strictly less than 1

501
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,630
OK so what does that mean that means that

502
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:38,690
you can think of the numerator being how close online at the next iterations compared

503
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,730
to have survived the current iteration

504
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,570
and limit this riccio

505
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,430
is some number less than 1 we call that linear convergence OK

506
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:57,430
that's a linear convergence and ambiguity example of linear convergence for example possible

507
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:07,290
1 intended to the art of him or any number less than one recently I

508
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:15,000
power has exactly this this convergence rate and as Site did here in all the

509
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,110
only example by the way test for you

510
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:25,030
so as i plus 1 over SI is 1 tends to the eyeballs 1 divided

511
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,350
by 1 intensity light which is just 1 10

512
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,540
and so we cannot linear converges with the

513
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:37,350
what what's a much different phrase you might used to characterize the rate of decay

514
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,860
distant peak

515
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,510
which i find a searchlight back

516
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,210
the first one

517
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,980
his peers

518
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,760
both the princeton here at MIT

519
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,330
i found his mind extraordinarily

520
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,800
exciting as well as outrageously eccentric

521
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,510
one of them called him

522
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,220
a bad boy but a great

523
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,900
he had an enormous effect on the people around you

524
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,500
even in their dreams

525
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,790
donald newman

526
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,140
who was

527
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:17,790
a graduate student at harvard while nash was an instructor here

528
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:23,540
tells this wonderful story in the PBS documentary

529
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:28,470
it's donald newman was famously fast everything that he did

530
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:32,750
i was working on the problem all day long

531
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:38,220
what it wasn't the proof was not working i was working in getting absolutely nowhere

532
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,260
is terribly frustrated

533
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,650
and finally

534
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,280
i gave up

535
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,690
and i went to bed

536
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,290
in history

537
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,980
johnny cash

538
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,510
in is

539
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,890
the next morning

540
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,070
gets up

541
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,590
he goes to his desk

542
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,570
and for the rights it down

543
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:12,820
maybe you could try that

544
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,230
so by the age of thirty

545
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,500
nash is magnificent access

546
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:25,850
of creation had one mathematical starting the prospect of a full professorship here MIT

547
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:30,860
fortune magazine singled him out as the most brilliant

548
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,740
of the younger generation of mathematicians

549
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,430
he also met and married

550
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,730
his gorgeous student

551
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,540
we should large data

552
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:44,050
now we show was described to me

553
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,490
by some of her contemporaries here as

554
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,350
call in el salvador princess

555
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,870
with the sense of noblesse oblige

556
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:00,480
she was one of sixteen women this is in the early fifties one of sixteen

557
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,980
in the class

558
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,810
eight hundred euro two

559
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,830
she was a physics major

560
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,680
and somewhat incongruously cheerleader

561
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:16,350
her girlfriends

562
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:21,130
described she wore these very high heels

563
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:25,130
and these bouffant skirt swirls inch waist

564
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,300
her the photographs

565
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,350
show that she resembled elizabeth taylor and butterfield eight

566
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,800
but her girlfriends also also

567
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,840
emphasise that the ethereal

568
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,220
need to we should

569
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,840
i always had

570
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,830
quote an agenda

571
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,120
that she always exhibited

572
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,910
a certain steele

573
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:53,390
in fact just like in the movie she first got

574
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,230
national attention

575
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,300
in his classroom with this

576
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,550
calculated act of defiance

577
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:07,320
anyway by thirty two all appearances john nash had adapted pretty perfectly

578
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,980
rebecca west's loss of life

579
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,370
but underneath

580
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,900
there was

581
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,710
chaos in contradiction

582
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:25,090
a neglected illegitimate son

583
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,430
abandoned mistress

584
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,090
an ambivalence towards

585
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,990
his new marriage

586
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,830
and his new wife's pregnancy

587
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,630
as for so many other

588
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,470
very gifted

589
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,830
extremely ambitious individuals

590
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,350
there was also this nagging sense of doubt

591
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,570
i probably don't have to tell the people in this room that

592
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:56,670
four mathematician turning thirty is about as bad as it is

593
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,570
four athletes were dancer

594
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,770
h is

595
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,940
the enemy

596
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,120
of creativity

597
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,980
so despite his stunning successes john nash

598
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,580
as you approach thirty

599
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,300
did over his perceived failures

600
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,580
the fields medal

601
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,840
that he had one

602
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,890
offer from

603
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,870
princeton our

604
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,910
you see MIT was what it is today

605
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,600
the offer from princeton harvard they hadn't got

606
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,430
the solutions to

607
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:43,830
these mega problems in quantum mechanics and in number theory

608
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,170
that he had found

609
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:51,340
the first signals of his slide from extreme eccentricity two

610
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,060
right so courses

611
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:56,860
were so cryptic so fleeting

612
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:05,130
many of nations colleagues thought he was simply indulging in one of his usual

613
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,910
private jokes

614
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,670
one new year's eve

615
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:14,740
in nineteen fifty eight he showed up at a costume party

616
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,130
wearing a diaper

617
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,740
and spent the night

618
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,740
sitting on leashes lap

619
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:26,560
alternately sucking on a pacifier and taking swigs from a baby bottle filled with urban

620
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,630
and now

621
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,420
one morning

622
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,800
not long after he walked into

623
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,830
the common

624
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,400
here at MIT

625
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:38,160
carrying a copy of the new york times

626
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,870
he said to know in particular that

627
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:50,500
the story on the front page contained encrypted messages from the inhabitants of another galaxy

628
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,540
messages moreover that only he could decipher

629
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,960
one of nash's graduate students was

630
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,670
so intimidated

631
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:02,340
fine ashes ferocious intellect

632
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:05,960
then he said nothing to anyone else who department

633
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,070
about the fact that nash had taken him aside and offered him

634
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,800
not only an intergalactic

635
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,540
driver's license

636
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:22,060
but i see on his newly organised world government

637
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,190
in february nineteen fifty nine

638
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:35,470
john nash gave a lecture at columbia university a much publicized highly-anticipated lecture

639
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,740
in which he was going to tell the audience

640
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,300
his idea of an idea

641
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,170
about the solution

642
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,190
we might

643
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,520
remember processes

644
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:52,080
the lecture which turned out to

645
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,730
which became the turning point

646
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,320
in the movie

647
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,490
that lecture started

648
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:09,090
normally enough but very soon disintegrated into a disjointed series of non sequiturs

649
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,680
and at that point

650
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,440
it became

651
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,440
impossible for the people around you

652
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,010
i wish to continue to deny

653
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,810
that something was terribly wrong

654
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,380
at first

655
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:29,290
we should try to keep her husband's increasingly bizarre behavior

656
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:36,020
but very soon she could no longer handle it on her own when she turned

657
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,710
to psychiatrists you're at MIT

658
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,060
she was told that

659
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:47,320
normally don't improve it because you are you know

660
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,000
your cards fraud

661
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:57,110
and even if you do improve it only work on one idea only

662
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:01,220
it's not that they would give you another idea in another primarily with another idea

663
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,080
and then you know in the group of then you would get like ten or

664
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:09,280
twenty ideas but you're all debating about one idea

665
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,460
it's not bringing q four

666
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,930
and of course then we are not using the capacity of everyone in the team

667
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,890
or we are using it in the wrong way

668
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,390
the results that the

669
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,570
born with some other companies

670
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,120
are enormous

671
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,600
and i think that least in slovenia things are getting

672
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:38,010
quite similar with those companies that are persistent of training

673
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,590
making their meetings much shorter

674
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,390
are getting much much more ideas because that's

675
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,690
are the most common problems

676
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,160
we spend all our day on meetings and then we don't have time to work

677
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:56,350
on meetings we have only few ideas so we don't really know

678
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,300
what to work on

679
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,710
so it would be much much used useful

680
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:02,680
to change

681
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:09,750
however the best for you

682
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:14,810
and i will be quiet like three minutes no

683
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:15,980
i have my

684
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,190
santa claus so i know in three minutes is

685
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:25,900
and you will try to think about your thinking which is a terrible because i'm

686
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,680
suppose nobody ever

687
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,980
i thought about their thinking is it

688
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,140
you know because this such subconscious thing

689
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,860
like breeding

690
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,090
you know that you are breeding colony when you're out of

691
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,330
otherwise you

692
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:42,720
but maybe you know

693
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:47,280
now reading to relax reading

694
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:50,770
four swimming reading format on

695
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,410
the band collie breed

696
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,100
you will get the results in the same which you're thinking

697
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:00,610
how you would think

698
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:04,090
that's how the results would be the end so try

699
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,520
to describe

700
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,850
you're thinking skills so far

701
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,340
its heart you never did it and you don't even know

702
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,100
which is what kind of language to use

703
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,450
use any kind of language

704
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,230
in most common words there are

705
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,830
and then try to find out what do you think it's positive about the way

706
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:30,020
of thinking about it is that is negative about it

707
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:35,070
how are satisfied with it

708
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,380
and then

709
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,970
maybe the last question

710
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,350
where on what occasion

711
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,900
what what time

712
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:47,060
do you think you do your best thinking

713
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,000
can you do this

714
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:51,870
every training needs to start

715
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,190
you know it's the

716
00:44:54,230 --> 00:45:05,110
analysis of what we are having now

717
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,570
so what have we found out

718
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,230
what we found out

719
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,650
about yourself

720
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:52,560
so there is no but so well together

721
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:55,020
how is it working for you

722
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,950
happy with it

723
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:22,590
i hope everyone said something about something that they are happy with their thinking

724
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:28,730
is there someone who didn't write they're happy with thinking that they're unsatisfied

725
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:30,810
well that's very rarely

726
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:33,610
because i would say if you manage

727
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,860
to leave

728
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,380
by yourself

729
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:37,850
with the money

730
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,180
if you produce with your brain and your work you should be happy

731
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,910
with the way of thinking

732
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:48,370
but this thinking is something that the bomb had another expression he founded out last

733
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:51,210
year it's caught in the net

734
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:55,110
but not enough

735
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,940
because that's how it is

736
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,070
what do we do

737
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,680
how we do it that's all excellent

738
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,100
maybe just not enough

739
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:08,350
and you gave me the idea to say something something else from

740
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,980
the bonus teaching

741
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,320
and this this this is the car

742
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:20,740
and you will see this is the symbol of something and one of the biggest

743
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,640
thinking skills that we learn that it is in our culture it's about judgement

744
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:31,100
analysis on one hand

745
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,450
and being critical

746
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:40,090
and the other is knowledge you know in school is all about knowledge

747
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:44,990
knowledge information

748
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,660
and maybe also the experience

749
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,750
but the one that says this is

750
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,610
you know

751
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,480
like the

752
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:54,880
the system

753
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:57,380
and in another car

754
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:01,510
but what is giving you know where all this cargo

755
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:05,490
this is something you know excellent this is excellent

756
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,200
but not enough of this

757
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,640
in the sky

758
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:12,580
so clearly this is also very pleasing

759
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,840
if you do the experiment on the moon

760
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,910
with the same initial speed it will go much higher

761
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,640
so you also happy to see that these g

762
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,810
uris is downstairs

763
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,810
for that makes sense

764
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,400
at what time

765
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:31,120
well the object b

766
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,400
point s

767
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:36,050
now there are two ways that you can do that

768
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:39,100
you go to this equation number three

769
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:42,760
and you ask equation number three when i use zero

770
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,790
i will give you two answers

771
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,950
will say i'm zero here at this time

772
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:51,200
and zero at that time and those are the two times that you want and

773
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,970
this is the one you pick

774
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,510
that's perfectly fine

775
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:57,140
i think is a faster way to do it

776
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,100
and that's the following

777
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:03,320
this is a perennial asos completely symmetric about the vertical about p

778
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,450
so to climb up from o to p must take the same amount of time

779
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,630
has to go down from p to s

780
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,990
so i claimed

781
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,470
at the time

782
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,170
we want as

783
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:15,190
must be twice the time

784
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,070
to each point p

785
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,100
and therefore it's going to be to visit rome

786
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:23,640
sign of

787
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:24,800
if find it

788
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:28,150
by t

789
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:35,600
we want to look again whether these errors the sign of have the right place

790
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,880
indeed if i increase the speed

791
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:41,440
i would expect it to take longer

792
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:44,690
before it reaches as

793
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,790
if i give it a larger speak

794
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,810
it will come out for

795
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,300
and obviously

796
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:51,920
time will take longer

797
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,420
if i do it at a high angle

798
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,270
it will also take longer

799
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,270
and if i do it on the moon

800
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,840
it also take longer

801
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,390
so this makes sense

802
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,490
these equations

803
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,610
a pleasing in terms of their

804
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,060
the rate is zero and sign

805
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:11,020
p equations

806
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:12,980
now comes an important

807
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:16,340
o point which i'm going to use rogers lecture

808
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,600
i want to know what ROS is

809
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:21,300
the distance OS

810
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,880
i showed up and it hits the floor again

811
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,540
what is the distance that it travels

812
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,190
well for that

813
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,030
i need equation

814
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,760
number one

815
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:34,670
it is the zero x times the time

816
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:37,360
and the zero x

817
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:41,610
the zero cosine of fun

818
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,770
we get the zero

819
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:45,950
cosine of five

820
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:50,280
find the time to get it that's too few zero sign of

821
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,910
so we're going to you

822
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,260
again a sign of

823
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,440
and i got to junior

824
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:59,390
and i have another

825
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,770
he zero there

826
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,910
and so the answer is

827
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:07,170
the zero to create

828
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,850
time the sign of the double angle

829
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:10,760
remember two

830
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:14,930
the cosine of the sign of phi is the sign of two of

831
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,200
divided by t

832
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:19,190
and this is o s

833
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,310
and what you need is a lot

834
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,990
this reminds me not to

835
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:27,820
remove it

836
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,040
i sort of wonder

837
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,020
and you should too

838
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,390
why is it that the highest point in the sky

839
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,590
as zero square and

840
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,940
and why is the farthest point

841
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,690
also what is also have zero square

842
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,700
what are you waiting you can reason that

843
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,400
why should not just be zero by be zero square

844
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:53,260
well i'd like to argue about the highest points

845
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,980
i give you a good reason

846
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,650
for the

847
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,900
distance OS

848
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,840
don't look at the equations

849
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:04,450
the simply

850
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:05,600
i think

851
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,060
four change don't look at the equations

852
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,390
the speed

853
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,930
if i don't know the speed

854
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:21,170
it's quite reasonable that the time that it takes

855
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:24,070
forty object to reach the ground

856
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:25,150
real w

857
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:32,150
while the time that it flies has doubled

858
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:35,370
the horizontal velocity has also done

859
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:39,130
and so did this and that it will travel in horizontal direction

860
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,070
four times that

861
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,180
twice course the time is

862
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:44,290
has doubled

863
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,940
another factor of two

864
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,390
because the horizontal component

865
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,630
has also double

866
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,650
that's why you see the zero square there

867
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,860
completely pleasing

868
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,250
this tells you immediately that's

869
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:02,310
the if you want to throw the the ball as far as possible

870
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,550
people who played baseball know that's

871
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,000
you should do it at forty five degrees

872
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:09,570
because if you throw at forty five degrees

873
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,070
this angle

874
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,540
ninety degrees and that is one

875
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,500
of course

876
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,340
in reality

877
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:20,730
baseball player knows better they give effect to the ball

878
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,440
the deals and drag

879
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,680
expendable the ball

880
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,520
and then these equations

881
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,070
i'm not valid this is only in case we deal with

882
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,930
was vacuum

883
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,560
and i would like to

884
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:38,110
some of the results that we have here

885
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,110
we have worked out here

886
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,480
i'm going to shoot

887
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:46,510
metal ball

888
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,400
i'm going to shoot at various angles

889
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:52,180
thirty degrees sixty degrees forty five degrees

890
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,340
and i'm going to make a prediction

891
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:56,390
if i showed up from there

892
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,060
we're looking to table

893
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:01,270
the measurements

894
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,160
it's meaningless

895
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,060
the uncertainties

896
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:12,020
but as the first thing we have to do this

897
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,220
the first thing i want to know is what is the velocity

898
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,390
of this

899
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:18,620
but when it comes out of the spring

900
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:21,440
and does it very well if i do with three five six times in a

901
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,280
it's not

902
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,010
twenty thousand dollars

903
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:29,300
so it is likely to very

904
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,530
anyway i'm going to do that is as follows

905
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:35,760
if i should an object

906
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,120
vertically up

907
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,020
that is the maximum

908
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,650
value that it can go

909
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:43,530
one of five

910
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,090
he calls ninety degrees

911
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:48,340
then the sign of phi is one

912
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:51,800
and the height is the zeros create divided by two

913
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,760
in other words

914
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,860
if i measure

915
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,050
the height if i should up vertically

916
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,520
and you can measure that

917
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:04,470
for me we'll see how i'm asking you to do that

918
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,980
then we can calculate

919
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,340
the zero square

920
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,210
and pi j here our

921
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,450
i guess it should be k

922
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,640
so this table

923
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:18,160
should be the mixing proportions is the probability

924
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,640
at any particular data point will belong to

925
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,340
mixture components k

926
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:28,940
and should component is given by gaussians with i mean me OK

927
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,540
and the covariance of sigma k

928
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:36,330
again we might want to ask questions about the weather

929
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:41,200
we want to be restricted to this promontory class of densities so do we really

930
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,210
believe that the true density estimation of key components again unlikely

931
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,830
not to be the case

932
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:51,700
and even if we do believe this OK companies how many major components

933
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:56,060
do you want to use right it's kind of hard to pick k using model

934
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,210
selection of

935
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,200
something needs

936
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:03,430
yet another example

937
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,950
so here we are we want to do latent variable modelling so

938
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,300
say we have an vectors of

939
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:14,060
and that observations x one to x and

940
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:19,470
and we want to model it as a linear combination of k latent sources of

941
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,200
of features or something so x i

942
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,600
it's going to be some from

943
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:28,100
FK from one two became

944
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,450
of basis functions lambda k

945
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:35,220
times y i k so why he is going to be only source

946
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:44,260
plus some nice to epsilon i so examples of this of latent variable models include

947
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:49,690
things like principal components analysis factor analysis in independent components analysis

948
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:55,650
so this are pretty standard techniques in machine learning and statistics

949
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,220
again we might want to ask

950
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:02,200
how many sources there really in our data right do we really believe that the

951
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,950
case also in order to

952
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,320
and how do we find k even if we do believe that is the key

953
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:14,510
and another question might be what prior distribution should be used for this also

954
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:21,330
finally yet another example of

955
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,880
parametric model that you now

956
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:29,460
i know all about the the flies lectures is that topic modeling with latent dirichlet

957
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:34,030
allocation right so here we have the task is that we want to infer topics

958
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,810
from a document corpus

959
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:41,000
topics now being can set of words that tend to co occur together in our

960
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,110
in different documents

961
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,780
the model basically goes as follows

962
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,600
so we have out the place here

963
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:50,680
they that do not

964
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:57,330
document and pi j is going to be a distribution over topics for the

965
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,830
document j

966
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,260
and then for every word in the document what we'll do is we first pick

967
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,120
a topic

968
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,500
by drawing from a multinomial given by

969
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:07,860
pi pi g

970
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:13,780
and then draw word given the topic indicated that j

971
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:20,710
from a distribution given from distributions q parameterized by theta k so i think probably

972
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:26,790
the notation i use is to be different than the flies lecture but we can

973
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:31,700
easily translate into them and again will try to be bayesian so we will place

974
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,480
priors on

975
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,280
and of course pi itself has the dirichlet prior and will place the dirichlet prior

976
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:40,100
on theta

977
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:45,170
again we might us how many topics can we find from the corpus

978
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,880
we even believe that

979
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:53,200
only has k topics maybe has more than k or maybe has

980
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:56,910
infinitely many topics like possibly

981
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,110
right so this'll parameter models

982
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:08,250
so now we're going to have perfect actually is any questions on the models of

983
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:13,360
it's pretty simple stuff like this so i will will in fact see that for

984
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,210
each of the four examples that give will try to

985
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:19,490
derive a nonparametric models for each of them

986
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:25,300
you're you're already know the answer for one of them right so for the regression

987
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,180
case is a constant process

988
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,480
the bayesian nonparametrics

989
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,300
that's kind of a few

990
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,950
philosophical that

991
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,670
o points about bayesian approach is why we want to do bayes nonparametrics firstly

992
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:49,230
we we tend to believe that models are almost never correct for our real data

993
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:53,080
and what happens if

994
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:58,300
what happens if ten is not correct how do we deal with model misfit we

995
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,860
can try to do things like the following so

996
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:04,900
firstly we can try to quantify how far away is our

997
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:10,170
model from the true model some some measure of optimality of fitted model

998
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:14,600
secondly we we might want to do things like model selection are reaching so we

999
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:20,180
i have a sequence of models of increasing complexity and we define the model of

1000
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:23,440
the right complexity to describe our data

1001
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:28,120
or in the case of averaging we average over this sequence of models

1002
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:34,720
the bayesian average thirdly we might want to do not restrict ourself to a small

1003
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,560
set of models right so we too small model class we might want to increase

1004
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,620
the flexibility of a model class

1005
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:50,000
and bayesian nonparametric models are basically parametric models whose flexibility has been increased a

1006
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:56,720
so that they are in a sense able to capture almost any

1007
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:03,600
the that's said we might encounter

1008
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:11,750
and they also good solutions from the perspective of model selection or averaging infected if

1009
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:16,530
that is that there is a different way of approaching this problem of finding a

1010
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,610
complexity for

1011
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:20,690
four model

1012
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,490
in fact it just stays

1013
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:27,510
in degree everything out and not worry about overfitting

1014
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:31,730
so you don't have to do model selection or averaging something they make life much

1015
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:36,050
so let's think that go into

1016
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:38,100
a bit of detail about why we

1017
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:43,630
might not want to do model selection averaging a list from the bees in perspective

1018
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:47,440
so let's imagine that we have beta x

1019
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:49,740
so x one to xn

1020
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:52,180
we have a sequence of models and k

1021
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:54,090
each parametrized by theta k

1022
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:58,290
k because one two entry and so on

1023
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,290
to do

1024
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:03,430
model selection are reaching we might we'll

1025
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,720
we want to compute the marginal probability of the data so p of x given

1026
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,500
mk is simply the integral

1027
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,010
over theta k

1028
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:19,410
of the probability of data under our model and also parameters and there should be

1029
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:22,300
PDS of p of data

1030
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:24,900
given mk sorry for

1031
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:31,590
paper was again so is the the likelihood multiplied by the prior over theta we

1032
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,570
integrate over theta

1033
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:39,460
so that's the marginal probability of the data integrating out of parameters and then we

1034
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:43,710
might want to do model selection in which case we want to find the model

1035
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:45,980
and k which maximizes

1036
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:47,600
the probability of the data

1037
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,470
given our model

1038
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,980
so if we want to be more bayesian we

1039
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
one two

1040
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,560
computes the posterior over

1041
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:58,840
model index k

1042
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:00,670
and all parameters theta k

1043
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,670
by this

1044
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,350
multiplying the prior over theta k

1045
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:08,910
by the likelihood and normalising

1046
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,900
don't x

1047
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,700
has been equals zero

1048
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:16,230
well the normal to the hyperplane is w hat

1049
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:20,710
just that different from plains OK

1050
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,250
i'm saying

1051
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,870
the margin the singer black

1052
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,930
is given by the projection of this vector

1053
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:31,540
o two the onto the w had

1054
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:33,440
that's the normal to the hyperplane

1055
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,660
if i project

1056
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:37,400
this vector onto the green

1057
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:40,900
i get the margin OK

1058
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:42,470
just plane geometry

1059
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,120
projections nothing mysterious

1060
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,630
so that's what i do now

1061
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:52,720
i will project w one w two

1062
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:56,980
on the normal to answer normal OK which is just given by

1063
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:00,970
w one one w that's the normal to the hyperplane

1064
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:05,560
and i observed for the projection just from plane geometry

1065
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:07,970
will be x one minus x two

1066
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:10,010
times this w

1067
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,370
so started with w one w

1068
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:16,040
just coming back to my previous equation

1069
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:21,450
i had already established this quite separately

1070
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,390
so the projection of this

1071
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,390
onto w over w will be equal to two

1072
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,970
over a model w

1073
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,060
just divide both sides by w

1074
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:35,890
and i'm really looking at the projection of this vector

1075
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,810
also known as a hyperplane

1076
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,040
and hence

1077
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:41,490
that the margin is equal to two

1078
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,720
on one w

1079
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,930
so you've been

1080
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,680
following what i've been nattering on about

1081
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:50,460
and actually argued

1082
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:52,930
the margin

1083
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,190
is given

1084
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,140
well values

1085
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,170
is this

1086
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:05,360
is two

1087
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,090
o more w

1088
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:10,890
actually if i define the margin i should really say the margins between here and

1089
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:15,610
here is one more w OK

1090
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:17,470
i'm saying

1091
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,710
in the day

1092
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,050
the distance myself here

1093
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:22,390
the distance

1094
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,400
the separating hyperplane

1095
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:29,480
and the support vectors is actually given by one on one w

1096
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:34,540
if i want to maximize the margin

1097
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:37,590
then i must maximize

1098
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:38,930
the subject here

1099
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:41,930
make as big as possible

1100
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,970
now maximizing one w

1101
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:47,930
it's the same thing as minimizing more w

1102
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:53,390
maximize this is equivalent to minimizing just this

1103
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,240
we've got

1104
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,990
the following

1105
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:02,250
maximisation the model of the margin

1106
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:06,330
it is equivalent to minimisation of w

1107
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:11,390
well minimizing more w can be same sort of thing as minimizing

1108
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,450
sort of forgot square somewhere

1109
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:18,480
but you can therefore imagine if

1110
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:23,420
trying to maximize mum mum margin is equivalent to minimizing f of this thing

1111
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:28,780
but subject to constraints and the constraints i already had

1112
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,320
and i had

1113
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,170
if i'm

1114
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:35,860
this object here

1115
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,370
was a plus one

1116
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:40,230
when y equals plus one

1117
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,890
this was the first one if the support vector

1118
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:45,720
and if it wasn't support vector and i'm not so the same side of the

1119
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:48,380
hyperplane is greater than plus one OK

1120
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:50,070
so this is a pos one

1121
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:53,770
this same will be greater than we could pass one

1122
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:58,040
if i'm on the other side of the hyperplane from the support vectors money minus

1123
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:02,750
and if it's and non support vector it'll be great minus one

1124
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:07,280
for the case of y equals minus one on that side of the hyperplane

1125
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:08,760
the end of the day

1126
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:12,610
that dictation of my my canonical hyperplanes

1127
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:16,220
can be written down as this constraint equation here

1128
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:22,190
so in the day and many losses how i got either these two

1129
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:25,300
we can define canonical hyperplanes that getting this

1130
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:28,320
define maximize the margin which gave me this

1131
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:32,430
i now have a constrained optimization problem

1132
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:38,360
because i'm trying to minimize some some something subject to constraints became that major league

1133
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:40,260
sensible flag my brain

1134
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,610
constrained optimization

1135
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:53,590
indeed most people familiar with optimisation if not doesn't really matter but just this so

1136
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:57,690
i now approach it from the viewpoint of optimisation

1137
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:03,470
i said that was called the objective function and the objective function has this subject

1138
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:05,670
which are trying to minimise

1139
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:08,260
and this is my constraint condition

1140
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,720
OK which i had just now

1141
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:17,170
and these alphas are growth multipliers which introduced because is constrained optimization

1142
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:21,860
he wanted her to go on all of multiply so this is totally obvious we

1143
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:23,590
have in which case you lost

1144
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:24,700
right so

1145
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:30,870
so these are logos multipliers so this object is my primal objective function

1146
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:33,240
now again

1147
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:39,300
if you find the optimisation you say all a primal formulation of our problem an

1148
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:43,380
equivalent dual formulation of the problem and is going to be the dual formulation on

1149
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,440
the go for

1150
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:51,180
and that if you know anything about that doesn't matter because show you just some

1151
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:53,900
derivatives to find a solution which will take you there

1152
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:58,520
this is my object arrived at primal objective function

1153
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:01,440
i'm going to just going to do to up operations

1154
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,340
which is

1155
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:07,150
i wish to find an optimum actually minimum of this l here

1156
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:12,110
the optimum what are the suspect is dl by DB equals zero

1157
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,800
and the other variable i have which is the l by the w

1158
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:16,880
to be zero

1159
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,480
b conditions on my gradient and inspect the optimum

1160
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,140
let's have a look at those

1161
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:27,840
so so the optimum i want dl by typical zero let's any b here

1162
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:28,810
that gives me

1163
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:30,690
this constraint here

1164
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:35,260
secondly i do deal by the w

1165
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:37,880
by w can quickly check

1166
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,720
that gives me w is equal to the same here

1167
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:48,710
my next thing is to substitute back this w into my previous equation

1168
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:54,290
if you to be familiar optimisation this is all striking obvious because it's working at

1169
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,910
a move dual

1170
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:57,990
not well just

1171
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,120
so i put back the w i just arrived in here

1172
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:04,680
here and here

1173
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:07,540
and that would actually give me

1174
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,540
the following

1175
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:12,610
it gives me the other day this expression here

1176
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,780
which is the jaws special

1177
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:17,860
the deviations being implies there exists choice

1178
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:22,650
here for which the deviations

1179
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:27,070
and in particular for a given l

1180
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:31,060
you know we're not able to construct a bad distribution wanted her to write we're

1181
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,820
just setting the existence of it through this policy

1182
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:40,220
OK so why is the expectation of this deviation large

1183
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:45,340
the intuition really should be clear i'm not going to go through

1184
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:50,840
any detail but we've chosen the distribution of the axes to be

1185
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,760
concentrate on the shattered set

1186
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,130
so the functions in class contains

1187
01:10:56,130 --> 01:11:01,300
OK can can compute all possible one valued functions on that shattered set around distribution

1188
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:05,190
like so somehow for most points in the set

1189
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:09,010
you know depending on the particular distribution we set things up so that for most

1190
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:12,150
points in the set we need to come up with a function that can guess

1191
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:14,570
where the conditional probability of y

1192
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:17,650
being one is greater than half or less than half

1193
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:21,030
and if we don't guess get that right for most points in the set then

1194
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:23,880
will file will be epsilon far from the optimal thing

1195
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:28,130
you know it turns out in estimating these probabilities you can't do any better than

1196
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:32,800
you know we have sufficient statistic is just to count up the the number of

1197
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,050
the proportion of points that you saw

1198
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:37,740
it took a particular value

1199
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:40,940
and had signed one

1200
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,190
and then compare that to half

1201
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:47,210
and now we're very familiar regime we're just looking at

1202
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:52,670
tales of the bernoulli distribution we can't have the error in this estimate increasing faster

1203
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:54,130
than one of group

1204
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:56,420
so i epsilon has to be of that order

1205
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:59,400
right and the d arises because we have no way

1206
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:03,990
the VC dimension arises because we're having to simultaneously estimate these things over

1207
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:07,570
essentially all off the shelf

1208
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:10,340
OK so so that's

1209
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:12,710
why the minimax right

1210
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:15,960
right so just to summarise that's why the minimum that that's why we get this

1211
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:18,510
OK the minimax

1212
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:23,110
estimation error is at least as big as or VC dimension n

1213
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:24,990
and the

1214
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:28,010
the minimisation of the sample based error

1215
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:30,920
over over the class and

1216
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:38,170
the minimisation of the empirical risk exhibits this upper bound of square expansion mentioned in

1217
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:43,240
these two just a constant factor park

1218
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:46,280
right we can see that but this one of the square of and is the

1219
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,920
right right in this case

1220
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:51,380
the VC dimension is the crucial quantity

1221
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:56,170
you know if it's if it's infinite then you know we can reduce the estimation

1222
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:57,320
error to zero

1223
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:00,860
if it's fine we can we know things go down like one of the square

1224
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,480
and then the optimal thing to do

1225
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:06,590
it's just this very simple minded minimize the

1226
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:08,760
the empirical risk

1227
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:17,760
OK so in this in this on estimation in this minimax estimation setting

1228
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,110
how when where

1229
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:22,210
you know this this captures the

1230
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:28,590
the VC dimension is the right notion of complexity the class

1231
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:32,280
but it is a little strange right it's setting it's easy to criticize because you're

1232
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,570
looking at the worst case of a probability distribution and if you think about

1233
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:40,130
the proof of this inequality

1234
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:41,300
right where

1235
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,960
constructing for every

1236
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:46,070
sample size n

1237
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:49,320
when constructing a probability distribution

1238
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:54,940
that exhibits this lower bound

1239
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:56,110
right so

1240
01:13:56,130 --> 01:14:01,340
and we're constructing it in a rather strange wiley's have conditional probability that's

1241
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:07,150
i didn't write it there right here that's really close to half rights within epsilon

1242
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:10,960
one of the two half so it's really hard you know we're looking down at

1243
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,550
this epsilon level

1244
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:16,900
we doing uniformly badly across all the wise to the optimal thing

1245
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:21,470
is very close to has has risk is very close to two half which is

1246
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:23,240
is terrible right so

1247
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:27,360
you know where exhibiting the minimax optimal right that that this right we get is

1248
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:31,030
the is the minimax optimal using distribution for which

1249
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:34,980
you know we probably we've we've got a very hard problem to solve here

1250
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:35,900
OK so

1251
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,490
you know it's not

1252
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:42,260
it's not such a natural natural distribution

1253
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,150
the that exhibits the slovak

1254
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,340
OK we can look also

1255
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:52,710
the restricted case

1256
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,010
here we can worry about the

1257
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,650
the case where there is some

1258
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:05,490
function in eq class that always

1259
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:07,530
does well

1260
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:15,490
this is because we can define a particle is zero risk minimax estimation error

1261
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:19,240
right the subscript zero here means that there is some function in class

1262
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:24,420
capital if for which y equals f of x almost surely right so you know

1263
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,820
this is a very strong assumptions about the probability distribution some function gets things get

1264
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,460
things right the bayes risk we the optimal

1265
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:34,210
risk is zero and is the function class that

1266
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:37,360
make the right prediction all the time we have a deterministic mapping from x to

1267
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,760
so this is a

1268
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:46,150
this is kind of the classical

1269
01:15:46,170 --> 01:15:47,860
the PAC setting

1270
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:52,480
you know for people who are for the history way where where you know you

1271
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:56,510
know that there is some function to get everything right and you want to be

1272
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,840
approximately correct so within epsilon of

1273
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:02,460
of the right thing with high probability

1274
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:06,110
so just just to go over so what we're looking for here in the in

1275
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:10,530
zero risk minimax cases for the best

1276
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:15,820
right what's the how how close to zero can we get a risk

1277
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:16,870
we're like

1278
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:19,550
we're going have no laws at all

1279
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:24,020
it is russian to women give birth in russian musicologist and any two experiments on

1280
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:25,380
the babies

1281
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,520
and it's terrific

1282
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:31,830
and this is like one of them where they compare babies looking at

1283
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:34,150
the first is this

1284
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:35,410
baby's life

1285
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,080
one of the face

1286
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:38,810
these are newborns

1287
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:43,860
there some preferences with humans and other primates the favor faces

1288
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,440
babies are also social animals too

1289
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:48,200
so the natural mimics

1290
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:53,290
andrew melts off for instance has found that if you go to a newborn baby

1291
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:56,160
and if you get if you find a newborn baby this is the first thing

1292
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:57,790
first thing you should do

1293
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,650
stick your face right up the newborn baby boy boys

1294
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,340
and stick your tongue

1295
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,990
and no self lines

1296
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:07,500
the baby is more often than not

1297
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,260
stick to tons of back

1298
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:14,760
suggesting some sort of social connection from one person to another and then later on

1299
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:16,650
babies are mimics babies

1300
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:20,270
more often than not will copy the face maximum

1301
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,650
the nature of these responses

1302
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:28,570
preferring faces this sort of mimicry is a matter of debate there's a lot of

1303
01:17:28,570 --> 01:17:33,690
research going on asking how smarter babies can we see you some of the same

1304
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:40,650
that we've looked at the physical world look at the social world and illustrate one

1305
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:42,830
of the studies i tell you what is the idea

1306
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:46,090
without recall mire and karen when

1307
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:49,890
and so we tested was nine-month-old and twelve models

1308
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:53,500
we show the movies sort of sitting down to singer movie

1309
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:57,690
where one character is going to help biology of gold and another characters and hindered

1310
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:02,150
and then we going to see whether they expect the ball to approach

1311
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,960
the one that helped first the one

1312
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:07,920
that standard

1313
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:12,000
this is what the baby was this is literally the same movie baby would see

1314
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:14,880
in the experiment the thing is

1315
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:18,890
for these sorts of experiments there's a lot to control so something that's the square

1316
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:22,330
in one movie will be a triangle another movie something that's in the top and

1317
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:25,920
one movie will be on the bottom and another movie so this is an example

1318
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:43,960
movie but this is what babies with c

1319
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:46,820
and if it is over and over again and the question is

1320
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:52,900
with a suspect babies with babies expected one to approach to want to help the

1321
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,460
or approach one

1322
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,310
that hindered

1323
01:18:56,310 --> 01:19:01,100
and what we find is statistically babies look longer when shown in movie word approach

1324
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:04,120
is the one that hindered versus helped

1325
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:08,020
and we just we take this preliminary evidence that

1326
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:13,220
they have a social interpretation they see this movie as you see this movie in

1327
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:18,950
terms of helping and hindering and somebody going to somebody that help was hindered it

1328
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:21,360
you could then ask this makes a prediction

1329
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:26,120
the baby should themselves prefer the creature who is to help reverse to hinder

1330
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:30,400
and to explore this a graduate students department kylie hamlet

1331
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:36,060
i started a series of studies where they wish they show babies three-dimensional scenes

1332
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:39,340
and then give them the characters and see which one they reach fort so here's

1333
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:42,860
video so you can see how this experiment is that

1334
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:46,280
the next trial from different study different being used and the baby is given a

1335
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:53,250
what one thing to note methodologically is the person giving a choice is blind to

1336
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:57,420
the set and blind here is the technical term meaning she had no idea what

1337
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:58,820
the baby source

1338
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:04,100
and the point about this is to avoid either intentional or unintentional sort of trying

1339
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:07,200
to get the answer you want he couldn't do that because she didn't know what

1340
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,430
the right answer is

1341
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:14,810
so here's what the baby would say

1342
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:28,470
this suggests that some social understanding

1343
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,000
maybe there from the very start

1344
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:32,620
this evidence is tentative

1345
01:21:32,650 --> 01:21:35,380
very controversial

1346
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:39,660
now i want to raise a huge developmental puzzles

1347
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:45,910
phenomenon together with several people including versus assembles others did a series of training studies

1348
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:50,000
in which they showed that this is likely to be learned because they were able

1349
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,550
to teach it to kids in the lab so here's the kind of training city

1350
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:57,470
they took seventeen month-old kids about a year and a half who very very clearly

1351
01:21:57,470 --> 01:21:59,320
don't have this shape bias

1352
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,760
and they brought them into the lab

1353
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:07,520
for a period in the six different different ways and replicated the number of times

1354
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:13,450
but typically six to eight weeks one session weaker about twenty minutes and the kids

1355
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:17,030
would play with these four pairs of objects

1356
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:22,070
and and just just an informal interactions so the adult would take the kid and

1357
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:25,790
it's a introduce this parents say hey these are these are two wins here's your

1358
01:22:25,790 --> 01:22:28,850
we here's my way let's let's play with or without that school you can start

1359
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:31,580
this on top of that and then after a little while ago to these and

1360
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:35,300
say OK now here's here's the log here's here's my login let's play with those

1361
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:38,290
for so they just introduced in a casual way

1362
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:41,060
the fact that this word can refer to both of these things and the key

1363
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:45,350
part of the stimuli are that course they matching shape but different other features are

1364
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,970
different sized are different color and texture and so on

1365
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:52,180
and after about eight weeks of training in this way the kids which we're now

1366
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:56,520
nineteen month-old had acquired the shape bias which means you could bring in these other

1367
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,240
objects which are not the ones state

1368
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,570
they don't

1369
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:01,500
trained on and

1370
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:06,620
and they would show this preferential generalization from just a single example based on shape

1371
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:10,700
so this is this is this is sometimes called second order generalisation because they were

1372
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:14,610
also able to solve first-order generalization problems namely given a new one of these kind

1373
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:18,270
of rectangular arches they could call that wins they could generalize from these two examples

1374
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:23,580
of the label with but they also acquired this this instance a kind of constraint

1375
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:28,020
on the hypothesis space which they can generalize to new concepts of the same sort

1376
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:31,740
now the most striking feature of the data for this experiment is a different set

1377
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:34,850
of data with the same kids where they looked at the effect on the children's

1378
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:38,930
real world vocabulary so none of this you know we observe stuff with funny objects

1379
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:42,730
but this is a real words in english it's it's interesting to look because the

1380
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:46,830
age at which they're they're getting at is just a joke which kids vocabulary really

1381
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:51,310
starts to take off the kids coming in seventeen months no this is the total

1382
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:54,990
vocabulary was on average about twenty five words this is in the words i think

1383
01:23:55,670 --> 01:24:01,400
these are words that their parents judge they understand which is the standard and repeatable

1384
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:06,660
reliable way to get measure rough measure of kids vocabulary and of those twenty five

1385
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:11,000
words about half of them in little more than half were labels for object names

1386
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:16,350
now then after two months what happened was the effectiveness of this training well for

1387
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:21,270
kids who were who were in the group that describe how they learned about three

1388
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:22,450
times more

1389
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:26,380
object words and they came and so they came in knowing about fifteen and by

1390
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:27,200
the end

1391
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:31,460
i guess is actually more than three times in other over about fifty five words

1392
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,450
so that's a very huge

1393
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:36,860
growth now kids at his age are starting to learn a lot of words so

1394
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:41,000
it's important there's a control condition which is somebody's dashed lines here and those are

1395
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,190
kids who had exactly the same experience with the same objects but they didn't have

1396
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:47,750
this this preferential this didn't have the

1397
01:24:47,770 --> 01:24:50,970
the objects labelled they didn't they're just like here's another it was play with our

1398
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:56,430
things they did they didn't specifically introduce novel names that correlated with the shape based

1399
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:59,660
categories and those kids will

1400
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:02,800
i learned many fewer words i mean the difference between the control group and the

1401
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,490
training group is certainly statistically significant as you can see by the error bars but

1402
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:11,040
it's a huge effect separate from statistical significance in these kids learned about three times

1403
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,970
more words than the control group over that period and it's an effect that was

1404
01:25:14,970 --> 01:25:17,880
specific to learning object names right so you can if you look at the the

1405
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,840
the mean number of words in general the kids were exactly the same so it's

1406
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,370
not like these kids are smarter somehow learn something generally about language they learn something

1407
01:25:26,370 --> 01:25:28,940
specific about how object labels work

1408
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:32,710
so this is this is very striking minutes if you if you think it's interesting

1409
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:35,840
to say well how does the person learn a concept from just a few examples

1410
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,990
here we've got the same thing at a higher level of abstraction right we're learning

1411
01:25:38,990 --> 01:25:43,120
how to learn concepts of a certain sort from just a few examples of those

1412
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:47,580
concepts right just just four examples of shape based categories each of which only saw

1413
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:52,470
two examples for you're solving the first order and second order generalisation problem how does

1414
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:53,690
that work

1415
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,930
well the intuition that smith method all had here is that get something like a

1416
01:25:57,930 --> 01:26:02,050
kind of learned attentional bias kids are learning to pay attention to shape for this

1417
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:06,620
kind of task and it you can think of this sort of saying that she

1418
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:10,970
is is a diagnostic feature one along which the relevant categories cluster

1419
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:15,130
and we can capture this in a very simple kind of hierarchical bayesian model this

1420
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:21,310
is again basically a textbook model the will extended in some directions although you've probably

1421
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:25,970
seen things like this before of show some some very simple illustrations with bags of

1422
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:27,170
there's hidden states

1423
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:29,280
and the state evolves as this

1424
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:33,380
matrix values of the current state

1425
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:35,740
it has in the past

1426
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:40,150
this prior over the initial prior distribution over the first

1427
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:44,730
in the emission model is given by these the south pole

1428
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:48,250
from another table which gives me observations

1429
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:53,710
four downstream is continuous observations not all hidden markov models and state

1430
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,480
my the phonemes in speech recognizer

1431
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,560
and then the samples are the

1432
01:26:58,570 --> 01:27:04,610
graph the vector of coefficients the capital corporation from the gaussians centered on four

1433
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:11,430
and similarly for the centre party after linear dynamical system common filter and here we

1434
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:14,160
have x european continuous vector

1435
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:16,180
instead of a discrete state vector

1436
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:18,640
and now this thing also falls down here

1437
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,420
given my past

1438
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:24,290
i sample might pass that's one of the gaussians model

1439
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,000
something like this

1440
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:28,230
which is linear function so this is good for

1441
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:31,610
things like tracking or

1442
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,090
flying planes and

1443
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,490
things like that

1444
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,430
it's not good for discrete types of

1445
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:37,750
hence the problem

1446
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:40,970
and given my sample also in image

1447
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:43,840
so there are two classes of things that in

1448
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:48,340
the framework to look pretty much the same as turns out the junction tree steps

1449
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:51,710
the junction tree structure with the months same as well

1450
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:57,030
so what we done one triangulated moralizing the message passing pretty much the same for

1451
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,250
the other

1452
01:27:58,270 --> 01:28:01,220
we just need to do some easy integration summation

1453
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,730
is the state transition model

1454
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:15,200
i don't have to stick to gas

1455
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:17,130
two other exponential families

1456
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:22,150
but things do sometimes get nasty few young girls in model

1457
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:28,960
if it is to make sure that things might blow up with the church so

1458
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,780
complexity micro

1459
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,420
if you're doing a mixture of gaussians each time propaganda message

1460
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:38,290
that makes of gases may go from ten thousand to one hundred thousand with each

1461
01:28:38,290 --> 01:28:39,810
step propagation

1462
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,970
so that's an open problem right now is how to mitigate that

1463
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:49,310
exponential growth has been gently to message passing when you nongaussian distribution

1464
01:28:54,210 --> 01:28:59,050
you could move away from the gaseous emission model and there's things like the kernelized

1465
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:02,790
common filter which is a nonlinear calcium

1466
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:05,620
it's another space and then you have few

1467
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:08,190
so we started doing things like that as well

1468
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,980
now also helps avoid

1469
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:12,980
putting nonlinearity here which

1470
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:16,170
the junction tree

1471
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:19,230
so these are all active areas especially in

1472
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:25,970
modifying these models so adding these mixtures are nonlinearities extended kalman filters and so on

1473
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:30,180
people in the control literature doing some of these people in the

1474
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,700
and the markov random fields of insurance also there's there's in physics as well variations

1475
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:39,090
of these nongaussian mall

1476
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:42,740
hard to keep track and everybody

1477
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:46,010
we're can also going there and modify

1478
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:49,000
the graphical models so one thing we want to do is to look at two

1479
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,360
person interaction

1480
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:52,260
and so there's two people tracking

1481
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:56,080
what we learn about two people person why the the same person as so use

1482
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:00,250
personalized was annexed they're interacting in we can

1483
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:03,160
track person and synthesize them

1484
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:08,320
caricaturing them to this person and they're just going through the virtual interaction or internet

1485
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:13,220
we like to watch the people that can model

1486
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:18,920
the the behaviour of y given access phenomenon enough about this distribution

1487
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,430
then i can make this person

1488
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,280
basically distribution

1489
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:28,460
and predict what's the most likely why say a

1490
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:29,300
for this

1491
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:31,490
human starts and this one

1492
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:35,890
what was the most likely wife's response with x

1493
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:41,260
more generally simple and stimulus response behaviours so what

1494
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,710
these two people applied markov models

1495
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:46,980
well we can just take one more three person

1496
01:30:46,990 --> 01:30:51,130
and then model this person with an HMM on this person HMS

1497
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:55,460
but there's no come someone try to predict this person's behavior from this one well

1498
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:56,660
this person is

1499
01:30:56,660 --> 01:31:00,580
so it's a game one of these things are probably need to

1500
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:04,690
so look at a few times before you will

1501
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,900
he completely happy

1502
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:25,250
OK so

1503
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:32,490
so we're going to take this step

1504
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:35,680
moving from

1505
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:38,150
the probability were interested in to this

1506
01:31:38,170 --> 01:31:41,200
probability over the double sample

1507
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:45,510
and the point i was making is that why we do that is because now

1508
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:48,660
because we are only interested in what a stars on x and y there is

1509
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:50,840
true error in this

1510
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:52,840
expression on the right hand side

1511
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:54,200
we are now able

1512
01:31:54,210 --> 01:31:55,870
two just considered

1513
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:59,470
a finite set of possible behaviors of h

1514
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:02,310
of this class

1515
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,820
and so we're down to a finite

1516
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:08,810
set of events that we need to bound

1517
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:12,020
the question is how large can be

1518
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:18,460
this is where we we start getting a little bit combinatorial because we're going to

1519
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:19,550
start looking

1520
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:22,720
at binary valued functions

1521
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:25,520
we're going to define

1522
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:28,000
what what's is known as the growth function

1523
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:34,720
as the b h m as the maximum cardinality of the set of functions h

1524
01:32:34,730 --> 01:32:37,310
when restricted to end points

1525
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:39,310
so remember we can in our case

1526
01:32:39,330 --> 01:32:41,300
respect to two points

1527
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:43,910
the sample and the ghost sample

1528
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:48,550
and we're interested in how many different behaviours can function class exhibit

1529
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:53,510
so we might consider as a linear functions are uncountably many but we've restricted them

1530
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:58,130
to look at what they do on just two hundred points or two thousand points

1531
01:32:58,190 --> 01:33:02,660
whatever it is how many different functions can they actually exhibit on that two thousand

1532
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:05,750
points and we'd like to show is that that is

1533
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:08,760
it's quite small clearly

1534
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:12,410
it can't be given to the to the end because there are only two to

1535
01:33:12,410 --> 01:33:15,800
be impossible functions binary functions on n points

1536
01:33:15,810 --> 01:33:17,260
so it's clearly finite

1537
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,510
no question that

1538
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:23,160
so we have a lot to the base two of BH fans less recalled and

1539
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:27,390
but for the statistics to work we want the number of functions to be much

1540
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:28,650
more than this

1541
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:30,510
we need to

1542
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:33,720
look at how that behavior

1543
01:33:34,050 --> 01:33:35,650
here's an example

1544
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:42,320
so this is linear functions in a twenty dimensional space so got three dimensional input

1545
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:44,370
and you're looking at linear functions

1546
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:45,710
you're asking

1547
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,720
on you know certain

1548
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:52,710
training set sizes

1549
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:55,370
how many functions can this

1550
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,440
class of linear functions

1551
01:33:57,460 --> 01:34:02,510
all what fraction of the the all of the functions can

1552
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:07,030
the class realise so i'm actually posting here the ratio

1553
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:10,670
of the number of functions that can realize divided by

1554
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:13,650
the total possible number functions to to the end

1555
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:16,830
so clearly when you have a small number of inputs

1556
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,580
typically you can

1557
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:22,160
get every possible classification of those inputs

1558
01:34:22,610 --> 01:34:26,280
you can do whatever you want to be like with those inputs in terms of

1559
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,760
but at some point

1560
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:31,980
the fraction starts to two

1561
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:33,630
taylor off

1562
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:36,140
and really relatively rapidly

1563
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:40,520
it it tends towards zero fraction of

1564
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:41,920
the number of functions

1565
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,750
when the number of functions to be an is growing exponentially

1566
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:48,200
so the

1567
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:54,620
the property here is that that exponential growth thanks actively kills off

1568
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:59,720
the growth in the h of function

1569
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,610
and this is the kind of property that will give us

1570
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:06,750
remember this will show the BH and

1571
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:10,990
is actually much much smaller than the total number that could be

1572
01:35:11,010 --> 01:35:11,960
and that's

1573
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,920
each of them is effectively the number of

1574
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:19,210
the size of the union bound the going to have to make w union bounding

1575
01:35:19,210 --> 01:35:21,150
over all possible behaviors

1576
01:35:21,170 --> 01:35:24,200
and that's going to be a chance

1577
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:30,750
and so now it to you know the next

1578
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:32,070
key concepts

1579
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:36,480
the vapnik chervonenkis dimension so we see you know this is not the

1580
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:39,860
venture capital etc etc vapnik chervonenkis dimension

1581
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:46,480
basically it is the point at which that

1582
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:49,820
graph here

1583
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:53,210
cuts away from one is the point at which

1584
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:57,980
the ph of then ceases to be equal to two to the end

1585
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,360
now in the case of linear functions is actually twenty one

1586
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:05,130
there are two twenty one

1587
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:10,480
dimensions twenty one so that at that point i mean all you can't see it

1588
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:13,130
this curve actually separates from the

1589
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,650
p o one line that point

1590
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:19,250
that is the

1591
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:22,490
VC dimension that form of the

1592
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:26,370
a class of linear functions in that case so it's the maximum and

1593
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:29,860
possibly the most important day in your life to

1594
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:34,600
certainly in our kids lifetime up to now because i eight nine ninety five small

1595
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:37,810
startup company in mountain view california

1596
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,030
it went public

1597
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:44,880
and the world has never been the same since

1598
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:50,480
give us two two basic flatness change the world

1599
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:52,820
the first was netscape invention

1600
01:36:52,830 --> 01:36:55,120
this simple point-and-click device

1601
01:36:55,130 --> 01:36:56,860
called a browser

1602
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,730
and what the browser did

1603
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:01,610
it was actually

1604
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:03,060
give us the tool

1605
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:05,370
that brought the internet to life

1606
01:37:05,380 --> 01:37:09,300
it was really the netscape browser that brought the internet to life because it allowed

1607
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:14,510
us to illustrate on computer screens everything locked away in internet files

1608
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:16,270
and thanks to tim berners-lee

1609
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,310
soon to be

1610
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:24,200
it's actually the netscape browser that made the internet this incredible tool collectivity the grammar

1611
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:30,200
grampa grandson and granddaughter not just MIT computer scientist could all

1612
01:37:30,210 --> 01:37:31,550
use together

1613
01:37:31,570 --> 01:37:35,480
so it's really the netscape browser that brought the internet to life

1614
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:40,930
but that wasn't the only reason netscape was a huge flat it's because netscape IPO

1615
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:44,490
let's keep going public in the morning of a nineteen ninety five and nine AM

1616
01:37:44,490 --> 01:37:47,440
is what actually started the dot com boom

1617
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:52,740
and that triggered the dotcom bubble and that triggered the crazy absurd ridiculous utterly

1618
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,220
how rages over investment of one

1619
01:37:56,270 --> 01:38:00,710
trillion dollars that's trillion with a t

1620
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:03,770
in two fiber optic cable

1621
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:05,440
in five years

1622
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:13,750
and what that crazy ridiculous absurd massive over investment into fibre-optic cable in five years

1623
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,380
was accidentally wire the world

1624
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:18,600
with nobody having planned

1625
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:22,930
so all those individuals offering their own content in digital form

1626
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:25,530
could suddenly send their bits and bytes

1627
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:26,960
anywhere in the world

1628
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:30,140
basically for free

1629
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:38,100
it was that fibre-optic explosion that accidentally but nobody having planned at made beijing bangalore

1630
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,510
and boston

1631
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,940
all next-door neighbours

1632
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:44,980
how did it happen well on the morning of a nineteen ninety five escape went

1633
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:48,870
priced at twenty eight dollars

1634
01:38:49,010 --> 01:38:53,120
their investment bankers morgan stanley one of the stock to be price to thirty two

1635
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:57,940
bit jim barksdale netscape CEO at the time did not know if this fails

1636
01:38:57,980 --> 01:39:01,450
i wanted to be remembered as the twenty dollars stock

1637
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:06,370
netscape open that morning it seventy one dollars close the first day fifty six

1638
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:11,320
and we all looked at that and we said well there is gold over them

1639
01:39:12,730 --> 01:39:17,640
and we went out and we what we every dotcom boom moved we we want

1640
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:23,670
every dot com moved called global crossing in nextel and GPS unit phase where you

1641
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:27,610
can form and i was in your four one KZ was born in nineteen was

1642
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:30,990
last night and when we did

1643
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,560
we accidentally

1644
01:39:32,570 --> 01:39:36,100
funded the massive over wiring of the world

1645
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:40,240
with fibre optic cable so every individual

1646
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:42,720
authoring content on their PC

1647
01:39:42,770 --> 01:39:46,490
because suddenly send the digital content anywhere for free

1648
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:51,980
thirty flat there was a quiet revolution was a revolution in transmission protocols happened across

1649
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:57,720
the nineteen nineties it was the alphabet soup of TCP IP in HTML and HTTP

1650
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:01,640
and XML and soap and hx you don't need to know even though most people

1651
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:05,130
here do what all the alphabet soup meant

1652
01:40:05,150 --> 01:40:09,370
it just meant one thing for the flat of the world critical

1653
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,200
this phenomenon

1654
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:17,250
it meant everyone's computer in software became into up

1655
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:18,970
we forget today

1656
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:20,850
what a revolution

1657
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,370
that was

1658
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:28,390
we forget today what it was like with MIT's administration first got compute

1659
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,440
and if

1660
01:40:29,450 --> 01:40:33,120
bookkeeping department government of the abacus many machine and the

1661
01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:37,930
computer and admissions got computers are very exciting day around here at MIT when i

1662
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:44,250
have there's just one problem bookkeeping got SEP and administration got windows

1663
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:47,120
they didn't connect

1664
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:51,720
collect any more than you were on your compuserve could connect with your wife on

1665
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:58,580
well what happened thanks to all those transmission protocols is that we make everyone's computer

1666
01:40:58,580 --> 01:41:03,820
and software inter operable it was acquired revolution i called the workflow revolution because it

1667
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:05,940
truly allowed work to flow

1668
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:09,720
and when that happens when you could suddenly sit at your computer terminal or someone

1669
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:12,270
in india and not have to think for a moment

1670
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:16,720
what is the computer and software that opencourseware is running out and what computers software

1671
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:17,670
do i have

1672
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:20,870
what i meant was we could all suddenly become

1673
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:27,720
so put it all together first like author my own content in digital form

1674
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:30,120
and i could send it anywhere in the world for free

1675
01:41:30,170 --> 01:41:32,540
and thanks to the workflow revolution

1676
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:38,910
suddenly everyone could collaborate with everyone else on their digital

1677
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:41,840
what we created

1678
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:45,360
right around the year two thousand right around the time of the millennium

1679
01:41:45,370 --> 01:41:53,230
was this crude flat world platform a global platform for multiple forms of collaboration

1680
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:58,500
suddenly more people could collaborate with more other people are more different kinds of things

1681
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:03,150
and more different kinds of ways from more different places for less

1682
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:06,690
than ever before

1683
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:09,190
is built on this

1684
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:14,390
now this flat platform then give rise to a whole new set of collaborations outsourcing

1685
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:19,060
offshoring to me the most interesting one which seems critical to open course ware i

1686
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:24,310
call uploading a term coined by kevin kelly wired not uploading in the conventional sense

1687
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:26,410
you see when the world was round

1688
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:29,030
you download as an individual

1689
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:31,420
but when the world is flat

1690
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:33,410
individuals can now

1691
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:36,680
upload and globalize their own content

1692
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:41,430
uploading comes in many forms open source software

1693
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:47,040
are the most was the most early variant and probably still the most popular

1694
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:52,450
open course software you just uploaded you're university online

1695
01:42:53,790 --> 01:42:57,270
it is in the old days if you want opinion on foreign affairs and redefine

1696
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:01,270
the dead like me not anymore now i go to iraqi bloggers

1697
01:43:01,290 --> 01:43:06,180
see what they're uploading as individuals from baghdad when i want to know what's going

1698
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:07,120
on there

1699
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:12,570
youtube uploading video and of course the mother of all of those wikipedia

1700
01:43:12,630 --> 01:43:13,830
the people

1701
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:17,260
are now uploading their own encyclopedia

1702
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:19,740
it's not perfect

1703
01:43:19,790 --> 01:43:24,490
or all you have to do is the subject of wikipedia to know how imperfect

1704
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:30,230
it's OK and anyone who thinks the network will get it all straightened out doesn't

1705
01:43:30,230 --> 01:43:36,020
have their biography on wikipedia but nevermind we will go there

1706
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:37,750
but the fact is

1707
01:43:37,790 --> 01:43:41,910
we're going for world where when i grew minneapolis in the nineteen fifties i remember

1708
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:47,230
when the encyclopedia britannica salesman came with all those but was inside and put them

1709
01:43:47,230 --> 01:43:50,820
down in the living room and then we got the coolest thing

1710
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,560
we got in card

1711
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:53,670
and you could

1712
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:57,640
download an encyclopedia

1713
01:43:57,690 --> 01:44:03,380
i think carter to two thousand seven had about thirty eight thousand entries

1714
01:44:03,390 --> 01:44:04,970
wikipedia today

1715
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:09,720
has about one point three million eight hundred forty eight hundred forty six

1716
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:13,590
exactly how they do it

1717
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:18,900
and there are sort of you know more emotional types knowledge and so

1718
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:24,220
for those of you that that's lost question you will have looked at this whole

1719
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:27,940
argument you know what's the difference between belief and knowledge so for us we not

1720
01:44:27,940 --> 01:44:28,280
going to

1721
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:33,700
making a distinction between belief and knowledge for us we can think of the you

1722
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:37,150
know the the sentences of the knowledge that we write down here is really just

1723
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:39,540
representing the beliefs of some

1724
01:44:39,550 --> 01:44:45,190
system more recent that's in environment and then when use representation to reason about the

1725
01:44:45,190 --> 01:44:50,030
environment act effectively

1726
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:53,070
but as i say the main idea is that we're going to take the world

1727
01:44:53,070 --> 01:44:56,350
in the knowledge that we write down is going to say that we view the

1728
01:44:56,350 --> 01:44:59,700
world to be one way rather than some of these are the things that we

1729
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:02,580
consider to be true the world regardless of whether they

1730
01:45:02,590 --> 01:45:05,410
there are in fact rule

1731
01:45:05,470 --> 01:45:09,350
OK we can use symbols to do that we see symbols in everyday life symbols

1732
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:14,290
for us have some intuitive meaning first a restaurant bathroom and so on

1733
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:16,160
o much astronomy

1734
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:20,220
in sort of a random letters

1735
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:27,480
so in knowledge representation is really about the symbolic encoding knowledge explicitly writing down

1736
01:45:27,570 --> 01:45:30,700
things that you know is a two things you take to be true of your

1737
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:36,730
environment right next and some sort of support

1738
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:40,960
reasoning part is that so once we've gone to all the effort of writing down

1739
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,110
all this knowledge in as symbolic form

1740
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:47,400
we want to do something with so the reasoning really is manipulating the symbols that

1741
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:48,240
we have

1742
01:45:49,030 --> 01:45:54,460
training at new symbols and those new symbols represent knowledge not that we have explicitly

1743
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:56,590
written so implicit knowledge

1744
01:45:56,610 --> 01:46:06,590
o was simplicity and what with explicitly written down

1745
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:10,900
OK so we might say well why is the knowledge based method good

1746
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:13,820
why do they always said if you look in particular at

1747
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:18,010
a lot of the research that is carried out in in computer science is a

1748
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:20,700
lot of people sort of reject this idea that you should

1749
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:25,000
explicitly represent knowledge this really think it's a waste of time

1750
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:26,870
and that really bugs you down

1751
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:33,700
you know if we look at systems that every that

1752
01:46:33,890 --> 01:46:37,320
you have to reason about recently complex behavior and so on

1753
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:42,040
a lot of times we describe them in terms of beliefs goals

1754
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:46,380
could be some emotional images like these and so on and intentions so for instance

1755
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:49,220
if we've got a chess playing program in particular

1756
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:50,330
movies made

1757
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:54,380
we might try to rationalize by saying well the program believe the queen was in

1758
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:57,630
danger but still wanted to control the centre of the transport and that's one way

1759
01:46:57,630 --> 01:47:01,690
of explaining what trying to rationalize

1760
01:47:01,730 --> 01:47:06,710
sometimes we might actually use way just describing it so we might say well the

1761
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:12,330
program has this you uses minimax procedure which is often used in game theoretic

1762
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:17,350
the systems and return values seven and it was this position that was the best

1763
01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:22,830
said this idea is called the intentional stance it in another way to describe the

1764
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:29,460
behavior of the system by trying to describe its intentions what is intended do

1765
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:33,020
so the question we we might pose cells will is

1766
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:36,720
OK i really just a way of being able to

1767
01:47:36,730 --> 01:47:42,100
i explain the behaviour of the system rather than a way of actually

1768
01:47:42,110 --> 01:47:50,830
implementing such a system

1769
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:55,060
OK now this is knowledge representation and hypothesis and i'll just wait it out and

1770
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:58,130
we're trying to understand because every time i read i can never understand what's going

1771
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:03,270
on but it's really when you trying to break apart components and it's really straightforward

1772
01:48:03,820 --> 01:48:06,940
so brian smith suggested this thing around

1773
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,730
early eighties and he said that the

1774
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:10,660
you know if

1775
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:15,730
applying this knowledge representation idea the idea that we're going to symbolically represent

1776
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:19,670
the things that we believe to be true the environment and then manipulate those symbols

1777
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:20,720
in order to

1778
01:48:20,750 --> 01:48:22,840
in for new knowledge

1779
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:27,820
well a hypothesis that underlies that particular way of going about doing

1780
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:33,720
and it's that any mechanically embodied intelligent process will be comprised of structural ingredients i

1781
01:48:33,730 --> 01:48:38,630
we use external observers actually take to represent a propositional kind of knowledge to several

1782
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:43,240
but by this point on maury laws like i don't know what he's talking about

1783
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:48,500
and be independent of such external semantic attribution play for causal an essential role in

1784
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:51,750
and in the alpine space

1785
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,010
i didn't write down nature this year did i here is the age of s

1786
01:48:55,010 --> 01:48:58,680
it's the same sort of idea made up of the same elements bx all the

1787
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:01,550
best in the world one of the best and so on but are arranged differently

1788
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:03,100
this time in six by two

1789
01:49:03,150 --> 01:49:07,010
matrix and you can easily check for yourselves these things are all of nodes anyway

1790
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,330
that when you multiply

1791
01:49:09,370 --> 01:49:14,650
this measurement matrix by this parameter vector you do get out the fine transformation which

1792
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:16,610
we first thought of which is

1793
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:17,970
which is here

1794
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:20,590
so we've got this nice linear parameterizations

1795
01:49:20,610 --> 01:49:24,790
of course they don't do everything that we want supposing i want to take a

1796
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,350
on structure

1797
01:49:26,370 --> 01:49:31,110
they find this fine results about the history of freedom is is good for playing

1798
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:32,200
structures were now

1799
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:35,750
supposing i draw an outline around the non plane structure

1800
01:49:35,770 --> 01:49:39,090
and i moved non plane structure well

1801
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:45,580
the leaves individual leaves and this plant pot close to play so what what i

1802
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:51,190
might get is that if i can insist on the inside find space that one

1803
01:49:51,190 --> 01:49:54,440
of these will be tracked by the contour outline but the other one will be

1804
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:57,570
thrown off because the space simply isn't big enough to

1805
01:49:57,580 --> 01:50:01,370
the capable of tracking these non plane

1806
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:09,470
we could still assume that we have this i find projection approximation of the words

1807
01:50:09,470 --> 01:50:13,310
that was seeing the world through a telephoto lens but clearly the six degree of

1808
01:50:13,310 --> 01:50:16,880
freedom model isn't good enough it's a bit annoying because we know what's happening as

1809
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:19,690
in space is still only six degrees of freedom i mean there are no more

1810
01:50:19,690 --> 01:50:24,360
degrees of freedom to be had out in three dimensional space

1811
01:50:24,370 --> 01:50:27,390
so i mean how many degrees of freedom you think one might need to represent

1812
01:50:27,390 --> 01:50:29,040
this space

1813
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:33,350
perhaps can't even be done but it could be done what degrees of freedom would

1814
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:36,340
you need

1815
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:39,700
that in mind i mean there are two planes in this example but i could

1816
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:42,880
have drawn an example with three planes of four planes in it

1817
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:47,120
and so you know the question is is the size of the space going to

1818
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:52,700
get worse as i add an independent planes what you think yes or no

1819
01:50:52,710 --> 01:50:56,430
not obvious shaken up

1820
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:58,700
the qualitative

1821
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:01,300
perturbation that

1822
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:04,540
what is the colour becoming who thinks yes

1823
01:51:04,650 --> 01:51:06,930
things that get bigger every time i add another

1824
01:51:07,270 --> 01:51:10,220
another independent plane

1825
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:13,750
and i think that the two things it won't get bigger

1826
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:15,060
one person thinks that

1827
01:51:16,250 --> 01:51:18,790
by majority the won't get because habit

1828
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:21,670
i suspect may be

1829
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:22,960
he's right

1830
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:25,900
so it turns out the answer is only eight degrees of freedom so that really

1831
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:30,020
is quite a piece of luck that you can take a on plane

1832
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:34,180
object and move around in space with six degrees of freedom you don't get a

1833
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:37,600
linear six degree of freedom parameterisation in the image plane but you do get a

1834
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:40,730
which is not that so if prepared to give away

1835
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:44,830
two degrees of freedom in the interests of any arity you know we're losing a

1836
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:49,300
the constraint the linearity is valuable and when it comes to come filtering as i

1837
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:50,030
said before

1838
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:51,780
you know really makes life a lot easier

1839
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:55,760
so there is in a dimensional space which is being exercised here you see i

1840
01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:00,330
started with one dimensional model

1841
01:52:00,350 --> 01:52:04,700
and just flex a dimensional model and it was able to fit all of the

1842
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:07,730
configurations of this non planar object

1843
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:08,750
and finally

1844
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:13,920
there is the business of non rigid deformation but i am

1845
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:14,790
we also

1846
01:52:14,810 --> 01:52:18,600
wrote the book my friend michael isard whose hand this is

1847
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:21,500
you may not recognise it but it is

1848
01:52:22,270 --> 01:52:25,800
we wrote a book together which is a reference to it at the beginning of

1849
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:28,550
this set of lecture notes and

1850
01:52:28,590 --> 01:52:33,760
all of these constructions for making spaces to fit jim very symmetric assumptions are given

1851
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:37,610
in more detail that in particular the last bit which are not going to go

1852
01:52:37,610 --> 01:52:41,280
into detail here what if you're allowed to flex your hands as well

1853
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:48,530
i mean you can imagine doing something like principal components analysis in this parameters in

1854
01:52:48,530 --> 01:52:50,560
this blind parameter space

1855
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:56,090
if you did that on sort of a training set of hand positions that would

1856
01:52:56,090 --> 01:53:01,010
be kind of wasteful because you you're wasting data data relearning these two dimensional and

1857
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:04,920
three dimensional affine spaces so that a little bit tasteless if you when you know

1858
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:08,960
perfectly well that this object is allowed to to move in three dimensions and you

1859
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:12,730
already know the answer to that the problem so a nice thing to do is

1860
01:53:12,730 --> 01:53:14,180
to is to do

1861
01:53:14,190 --> 01:53:20,000
what you might call residual per principal components analysis we take the data factor of

1862
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:24,360
that compound the data which is explained by this analytical model you already have and

1863
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:27,430
then apply principal components analysis two

1864
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:31,910
the residue of the data as it were three each of those residue vectors which

1865
01:53:32,170 --> 01:53:38,180
now contains variation only that is not only the variation is not explained by fun

1866
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:43,630
so that's a good thing to do so that's a general methodology for building a

1867
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:45,860
reasonable models that can do

1868
01:53:45,870 --> 01:53:48,280
some rigid transformation and also some

1869
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:54,770
OK so now we've got a family of curves and the problem is how to

1870
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:58,290
curves to data

1871
01:53:59,670 --> 01:54:02,330
supposing you have an approximate position

1872
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:07,060
for the cover starting position this one is extremely good starting position and now suppose

1873
01:54:07,070 --> 01:54:08,440
new search

1874
01:54:08,450 --> 01:54:13,260
in various directions out from the starting position so suppose you

1875
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:18,830
so it's still proportional to p of q

1876
01:54:18,850 --> 01:54:24,020
right so because there are numerous ways of doing monte carlo including markov chain monte

1877
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:27,390
carlo which was which you've heard about which will such a little bit about

1878
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:33,970
tomorrow and particle filtering context simulated annealing is an example of monte-carlo importance sampling which

1879
01:54:33,970 --> 01:54:40,070
is the fundamental building block behind these particle filters a quasi monte carlo and so

1880
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:43,900
but sequential monte carlo methods here

1881
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:52,690
and just a trick that gets used throughout monte carlo inference which will play a

1882
01:54:52,690 --> 01:54:56,870
part in my particle filter derivation in a minute

1883
01:54:56,870 --> 01:55:03,770
monte carlo cells difficult integrals what i wanted to build itself nicely is the marginalisation

1884
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:06,200
in go up automatically because

1885
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:07,470
if i have

1886
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:13,740
the two quantities save the state and the nuisance parameter in this case drawn from

1887
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:15,900
the joint posterior distribution

1888
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:18,160
for those unknowns

1889
01:55:18,170 --> 01:55:19,730
given the data y

1890
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:25,010
then it immediately follows that by simply extract the samples x from that joint draw

1891
01:55:25,170 --> 01:55:27,550
draws from the marginal effects

1892
01:55:27,570 --> 01:55:30,320
similarly the features are draws from the marginal

1893
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:31,300
the theta

1894
01:55:31,340 --> 01:55:37,720
informally you can see that drops out just from the factorisation of the joint in

1895
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:42,720
terms of the marginals tied the conditional so that's the model for that's the marginal

1896
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:45,890
the theta so bear that in mind is because we use that in the basic

1897
01:55:45,890 --> 01:55:48,630
particle filter derivation at the moment

1898
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:49,310
but now

1899
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:55,500
and we define the state space models and the filtering and smoothing objective basic particle

1900
01:55:55,500 --> 01:56:03,890
field OK so state space models are quite general way of representing time series models

1901
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:09,470
they include things like hidden markov models on a discrete state space is most of

1902
01:56:09,470 --> 01:56:15,500
the standard time series models things like autoregressive moving average models we don't apply to

1903
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:21,620
some of the integrated models that appear in finance because you can represent those the

1904
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:27,190
finite dimensional state vector but also all of the special models that we can try

1905
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:33,950
for applications in tracking computer vision finance communications and so on

1906
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:39,650
we need more of the text oh yes yes yes so i'm going to do

1907
01:56:39,690 --> 01:56:47,020
all of this derivation in terms of of markovian state space model in fact is

1908
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:52,440
that's not necessary but simplifies than the notation so for example in the right blackwellized

1909
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:59,070
particle filter that we hear more about tomorrow you're effectively dealing with non markovian setup

1910
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:01,670
and it does work the notation more

1911
01:57:03,570 --> 01:57:07,610
the notation are used is

1912
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:13,060
column vectors will be standard typefaces lowercase so for example the state at time t

1913
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:15,530
will be x of t

1914
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:17,620
and the matrices will be

1915
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:21,200
just standard typeface capital letters

1916
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:25,210
just to avoid the need of heavy heavy typeface

1917
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:31,910
and we consider a time series with states xt t on some time at the

1918
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:37,640
north pole got never noticed that before no one to take

1919
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:43,620
the states evolve in time according to a probability model so this is a stochastic

1920
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:45,020
state space model

1921
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:49,940
and we assume as i say an markovian structure so that if i look at

1922
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:53,190
the distribution of the new state at time t plus one

1923
01:57:53,190 --> 01:57:57,270
given all the previous states up to that time it only depend on the previous

1924
01:57:57,270 --> 01:58:03,050
state x x fifty and i'll always know that here is that density is the

1925
01:58:03,050 --> 01:58:07,970
probability density function of the that as f of x t plus one given x

1926
01:58:08,370 --> 01:58:10,010
that the dynamical model

1927
01:58:10,030 --> 01:58:15,470
all the state space model underlying the state evolution

1928
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:20,650
we assume partial observations again a stochastic observation of the state

1929
01:58:20,650 --> 01:58:26,470
there some observations sense function or likelihood function for a set of observations y t

1930
01:58:26,490 --> 01:58:28,840
which are assumed to be independent

1931
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:30,750
conditional upon states

1932
01:58:30,770 --> 01:58:38,250
so again that's the kind of markovian assumptions about the observations so new observation

1933
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:42,470
conditional upon any of the all the whole state sequence out

1934
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:47,910
the time t plus one and any of the previous observations but only depend

1935
01:58:47,910 --> 01:58:53,570
on the current observations so that's markovian assumption about the observations always label the observation

1936
01:58:54,490 --> 01:58:57,590
as as case g

1937
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:59,540
so i got the dynamical model

1938
01:58:59,570 --> 01:59:01,970
the observation density

1939
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:05,960
these what it will be assumed

1940
01:59:05,970 --> 01:59:12,200
i will be specified so we're not learning the dynamical model or the observation model

1941
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:17,240
in this it in this set-up although of course they can be parameterized by extra

1942
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:21,140
define all the melting point of the two end members say copper nickel

1943
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:24,130
and i want to know what's the melting point about fifty fifty

1944
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:26,740
copper nickel alloys adjust the halfway

1945
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:30,560
temperature between the two orders the temperature goes through local

1946
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:35,200
maximum order to go through a local minimum or is attempt to go nuts i

1947
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:41,640
mean the question is how does temperature of some critical feature very with composition

1948
01:59:41,690 --> 01:59:44,200
so we need to look at three-dimensional

1949
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:48,530
stability maps and this pain that because the three d and its

1950
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:50,260
it's messy but

1951
01:59:51,450 --> 01:59:53,350
this is the real line one

1952
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:58,250
and three o nine one is three nine one is concerned about solid state chemistry

1953
01:59:58,290 --> 02:00:01,990
so in three o nine one we care more about

1954
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:04,710
liquid solid equilibrium

1955
02:00:04,910 --> 02:00:12,090
instead of liquid vapor equilibrium because we don't process too many

1956
02:00:13,880 --> 02:00:15,390
in the vapor stage

1957
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:19,380
we don't use too many materials as vapours this is the

1958
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:24,600
equilibrium this most important so we we know that equilibria

1959
02:00:24,630 --> 02:00:27,210
equilibria depend upon

1960
02:00:28,460 --> 02:00:29,850
depend upon

1961
02:00:30,870 --> 02:00:33,590
pressure and composition

1962
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:40,030
and it turns out that when it comes to the liquid solid equilibrium liquid solid

1963
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:44,020
equilibrium is strongly dependent

1964
02:00:44,130 --> 02:00:52,640
there's a strong dependence between the temperature transformation and composition

1965
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:53,830
where as

1966
02:00:53,830 --> 02:01:00,680
the relationship between the temperature of the transformation and pressure is weakly

1967
02:01:00,770 --> 02:01:02,640
weakly dependent

1968
02:01:02,700 --> 02:01:05,910
there's a weak dependence between pressure and

1969
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:10,430
the temperature of the transformation of what we saw that last a these are not

1970
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:11,500
to scale

1971
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:15,460
in other words these lines are nearly vertical for solid liquid you would have to

1972
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:18,500
apply geological pressures to alter

1973
02:01:18,510 --> 02:01:21,510
the melting point of water substantially

1974
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:26,540
all right whereas we saw doesn't take anything more than just a rise in elevation

1975
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:29,510
several thousand feet to move the boiling point

1976
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:32,560
so that means that i can throw away

1977
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:34,520
the pressure dependence

1978
02:01:34,570 --> 02:01:40,260
throw away the pressure dependence and just focus on the two two-dimensional relationship between the

1979
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:43,770
temperature of the transformation and

1980
02:01:43,830 --> 02:01:45,530
the composition

1981
02:01:45,580 --> 02:01:48,180
so that's what we're going to do we're going to look at three different types

1982
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:52,620
of of binary systems and in each case we're going to assume that the pressure

1983
02:01:52,620 --> 02:01:57,620
is one atmosphere and we know that the dependence of the transformation temperatures that we

1984
02:01:57,620 --> 02:02:03,700
write is going to be negligible in terms of the impact pressure might have on

1985
02:02:03,710 --> 02:02:08,330
so let's look at the real get three different types of systems and there are

1986
02:02:08,330 --> 02:02:12,200
all dependent upon the extent solubility and i've given them the

1987
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:16,240
what's the word

1988
02:02:16,260 --> 02:02:18,020
very catchy

1989
02:02:18,030 --> 02:02:22,460
very catchy distinctions of type one type two

1990
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:27,070
type three right so let's look at the type one type one type of binary

1991
02:02:28,090 --> 02:02:33,020
OK and type one binary system has complete

1992
02:02:33,020 --> 02:02:35,750
complete solubility

1993
02:02:35,790 --> 02:02:42,650
by this i mean complete solubility the two components complete solubility in solid

1994
02:02:42,670 --> 02:02:46,300
and liquid states

1995
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:48,600
so that is to say if i makes a and b

1996
02:02:48,610 --> 02:02:53,050
they will mix in all proportions in solids and all mix in all proportions as

1997
02:02:54,550 --> 02:02:57,480
and the second thing is we're looking at

1998
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:59,190
change of state

1999
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:01,740
change of state

2000
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:05,890
so this diagram applies to a change of state and since we're talking about

2001
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:09,670
solid liquid there's only one way

2002
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:11,480
we need to document

2003
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:15,500
and let's think about

2004
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:19,020
what's the relevant chemistry here i mean i've been telling you that phase diagrams are

2005
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:23,090
stability maps and you can just look at the moment and consult them but there's

2006
02:03:23,090 --> 02:03:28,070
always some basic chemistry embedded in these diagrams so for example if it were metal

2007
02:03:28,090 --> 02:03:32,670
system and i would tell you that these two metals a and b

2008
02:03:32,710 --> 02:03:37,650
mix in all proportions as solids and liquids what would have to be the characteristics

2009
02:03:37,650 --> 02:03:39,360
of those two models

2010
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:45,270
they would have to be either very nearly similar or maximally different

2011
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:49,260
they have to be very nearly similar and in fact that's good it's sort of

2012
02:03:49,260 --> 02:03:52,270
a take-off on like dissolves like

2013
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:56,800
so complete solid solubility liquid state with respect to metals

2014
02:03:56,820 --> 02:04:00,820
when it comes to metals there is a set of rules called the human rothery

2015
02:04:03,090 --> 02:04:08,610
the robbery was a british metal are just he enunciated

2016
02:04:09,140 --> 02:04:11,010
a set of rules for
