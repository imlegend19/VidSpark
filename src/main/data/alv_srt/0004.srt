1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
so i use the next forty minutes the test

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,280
and share some recent work

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,410
carried out by a number of collaborators one of whom is in the audience professor

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,820
the others the all about a significant fraction

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,520
i real economists

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,140
and the very first thing i'd like to emphasise with collaborators is not only

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,640
they do the work

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,160
but if we did not collaborate with real economies we would have many many many

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,450
more mistakes

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:35,770
i'm not saying there are no mistakes by collaborating interdisciplinary science with subject specialists you

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,770
minimize the number of mistakes i'd like to get that point across particularly to young

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,990
people who may

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,090
i have the confidence so they can do everything themselves or field that's expected of

14
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,470
them to do everything themselves

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,520
so the data

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,870
key question will ask the question that any physicist would ask when confronted with any

17
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,120
kind of economic fluctuations

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,780
we take any newspaper any newspaper a significant fraction of that paper is the bunches

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,230
of numbers which are the fluctuations in stock market prices then not the prices no

20
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,420
one cares no one even knows what they mean we care about the fluctuations

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,280
this is obviously the subject matter of statistical physics

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,810
but in statistical physics we asked the most obvious questions like how why what's going

23
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,270
on here near a critical point for example there are use fluctuations and bought over

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,610
their correlated so they're bigger than they would be if they were not correlated

25
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,750
and we ask why why why should a critical point may the fluctuations

26
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,830
so we'll have a simple question here about the economy

27
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,950
we have far more or less

28
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:49,030
the paradigm that worked in critical phenomena and that paradigm at the risk of belittling

29
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,730
the work very great people was first and foremost to start with the experiment to

30
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:02,060
form bonds between experimentalists and simulators and calculators and it was only many many years

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:09,060
later that people such as a wilson gallegati and others began to

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,400
formulate some kind of theory we are roughly in that stage we have mainly collected

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,990
experimental facts about the economy

34
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,440
and we have begun just begun

35
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,370
when i say we i mean in collaboration was obviously got there

36
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,760
one french writers prize year or so ago or the best kind of physicists under

37
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,850
certain major forty

38
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,370
i had to begin an actual possible theory

39
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,590
but you know theories come and go and most theories only one of them

40
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,660
generation people died formulated in the theory is over

41
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:49,760
and the experiments if they correctly forever because the fact so i'm i like to

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,460
argue that although experiments without theory is anathema

43
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,090
in the dogma of many economists

44
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,590
who refused to look at experiments or even to do experiments we don't have a

45
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,590
to guide us

46
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,690
none the less they are in fact in

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,130
critical phenomena the facts came first so let's start with some facts

48
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,220
will ask what really matters for these complex

49
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,620
financial fluctuations and in particular with zero in on some very recent work is still

50
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,650
not even rejected ones

51
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,810
much less twice

52
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:33,220
with tobias price very brilliant young graduate student from mines and his thesis advisor

53
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,010
your highness schneider

54
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:41,540
i always believe that nothing can happen without support because students have to pay the

55
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,290
and the rain comes from us our in this hour comes from the government and

56
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,600
economics you can imagine this is almost impossible because the gap between economists physicists is

57
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,460
so huge we simply cannot happen to their money

58
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,570
and after seven tries

59
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,030
and the last four of them with an economics collaborator that then this case we

60
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,780
finally got not one gram but three grants so i have to thank the grand

61
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,040
monitor more than anybody because none of this would have been possible without the students

62
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,400
and this would be possible without the money

63
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,560
i have to handouts one is a little one-page editorial

64
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,520
back on the so-called back

65
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,440
a free newspaper so what could be lower than to be the last page something

66
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,630
that's very

67
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,710
nevertheless it's something i'm really proud of it just to my views about the current

68
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,760
economic crisis in light of what some of us have been doing for the last

69
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,290
and then secondly out tried to keep this talk fairly broad brush because there's a

70
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:49,550
website which you can get just by googling any version of my name and and

71
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,320
that has the actual papers pdf

72
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:58,070
OK let's get moving let's start with the experiment this plot is the time dependence

73
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,820
of an economic

74
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,640
the standard and poor five hundred the average of the largest five hundred companies in

75
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,570
the US

76
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:16,560
by market capitalization over roughly forty year period deflector obviously

77
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,120
we all know that factories

78
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,940
we get the desired log scale and the y axis and

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,420
and we see that it sometimes is more or less constant for a period and

80
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,370
went appropriate and now we all know what to story

81
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,380
at the bottom curve is

82
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,310
the simplest theory which again as many of you know is formulated not by professor

83
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,190
but by student by showing a in nineteen hundred over one hundred years ago

84
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,370
and he model this fluctuating quantity by a drunkard walk a drunken for crying every

85
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,020
his wristwatch or we tried to going drugs

86
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,300
and and if if the coin is heads he or she moves

87
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,420
to the right in order the same down and if if the if the coin

88
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,880
is tails here she moves up

89
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,940
and using this simple

90
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,550
a simple model

91
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,130
but actually generated fluctuating to encourage that again at least to the eye looks identical

92
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,420
with the data they both fluctuating in fact if there are parts of this are

93
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:31,150
completely indistinguishable but that every now and then you know once a generation

94
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,800
there's a fluctuation such is what's called black monday

95
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,100
in eighty seven

96
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:43,870
it's much cheaper computationally

97
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,470
and the reason not

98
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,120
so there is an issue of

99
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,840
preserving independence

100
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,030
but it's actually probably possible to cope with that instead of taking the actual you

101
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,850
can just some sample from the in the two ways to preserve the independence

102
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,760
more worrisome

103
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,140
this may by augmenting the feature space

104
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,390
he made the problem harder

105
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,350
need to think about the

106
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:15,010
if you decide to actually do exactly this

107
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,740
so this theorem

108
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,390
sam is actually kinda nice

109
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,970
it is very classifiers

110
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,700
so classifiers taking this

111
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,260
future spacecraft

112
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,220
predicting one bit

113
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,800
for the distribution

114
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,910
on extrac zero one

115
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,760
this is what you want to write

116
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,660
this is

117
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,490
the probability of y

118
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,950
because one given x

119
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,450
is bounded by something that something is

120
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,620
OK so we have some

121
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,430
some distribution

122
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,120
we have this process

123
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,100
picking up p

124
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,680
and evaluating c

125
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,490
which is the new distribution

126
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,280
or binary problems so this is the name

127
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,240
the new distribution

128
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,870
OK so

129
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,970
is distribution

130
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,660
so we have the area specular distribution

131
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,050
minus the minimum error rate

132
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,200
it's possible

133
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,320
if i just talked about the error

134
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,100
this would not be convincing theorem

135
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,660
the reason why would i missing is because

136
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,720
the problems that are created are inherently noisy

137
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,450
we have to subtract off

138
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,030
dairy due to the noise

139
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:41,410
and then then this theorem so it does something interesting

140
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,890
so this is that

141
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:47,160
this quantity years regret right it's it's how that we do

142
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,600
so that we could do

143
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,490
which is

144
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,100
i regret

145
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,080
that says that if we have

146
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,080
a small regret

147
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,620
spec two

148
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,180
for the SE

149
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,430
do we have good probability estimates

150
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,120
so this is kind of cool because

151
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,720
we can actually observe this

152
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,300
we can compute this

153
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,510
i think this we on this

154
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,740
we know that

155
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,760
nevertheless minimizing this is equivalent to optimizing that

156
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:44,010
so all i said was

157
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,510
we have always as piece which the importance is

158
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,760
we just p

159
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,550
we have the name in the feature space

160
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,100
we can get it

161
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,180
it doesn't matter for the theorem

162
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,850
the time i in practice

163
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,010
the equivalent as far as the distribution is induced to this process

164
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,680
and that process of their

165
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,280
and this is same distribution over samples that you

166
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,680
evaluate the classifier

167
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,200
but the question is whether or not that any set

168
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,510
it's actually

169
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,970
depends if you actually

170
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,580
do this in practice

171
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,680
you probably want to do something like this

172
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,680
the point

173
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:42,740
any other questions

174
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,640
OK so

175
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,370
is there is a little bit

176
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,550
less trivial to prove

177
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,890
right so

178
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,570
here's a pretty picture

179
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,010
and what does it tell us

180
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,950
so the importance weight loss

181
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,720
this weighted loss

182
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,430
so when actual answer is zero

183
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,300
importance weight loss be editing wrong

184
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,180
it's like this red line

185
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,570
and when the answer is one inside the blue line

186
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,100
and it will turn out that

187
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,780
we have a convex combination of zero and one when the probability

188
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:30,120
imagine that the information that is would that we have to the world is exactly

189
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,010
what we have is an asian wandering around the world

190
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:37,500
so is h one around the world you know we have some state we see

191
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,520
and then we can choose some action

192
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,700
and then we have what happened next

193
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,110
going into some action what happens next

194
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,020
so in particular

195
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,320
and people doing reinforcement learning the think about other sorts of interactions the ways to

196
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,730
interact with the world so i think about the generative models where they can say

197
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,780
i suppose over here and take this action what happens next and support and here

198
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,580
i take this action instead what happens next

199
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,860
but we're not doing that instead what was going to be

200
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,510
it is it is if you are the reinforcement learning agent you can imagine

201
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,070
using the hugh durrant two to two

202
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,140
decide how much going to explore exploit

203
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,490
the way this works is

204
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,110
we have a current state s that we know

205
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,410
choose some action

206
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,960
and we observe the next state

207
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,340
also a reward

208
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,280
so the goal in reinforcement learning is so

209
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,570
in addition to

210
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
the distribution

211
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,690
the next given the action state

212
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,820
some kind of reward

213
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,730
which may be a function of

214
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,750
in general the strip

215
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:27,010
two other questions about the setting because

216
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,250
now's a good time to think about

217
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,880
the setting makes sense

218
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,070
i don't think this is the right most setting and actually if you find a

219
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,340
problem with the particular setting in machine learning issues in general think about

220
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,510
how you want to fix it because

221
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,040
it is not clear that we have the right settings

222
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,240
we had this modernization process

223
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,470
which has some sort of states some actions per state

224
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,610
and the distribution over the next eight given the state and the action

225
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,510
we have some horizon t

226
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,420
and then

227
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,370
the question is what is this by

228
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,920
what is this thing is going to hold of high probability right so

229
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,660
a seven complexity guarantee

230
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:24,150
as a statement like at the centre of example some guarantees going to hold

231
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,550
the question what is the guarantee

232
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,310
so there's

233
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,210
a guarantee

234
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,870
in the original EQ paper

235
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,510
this is something like if you

236
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,310
additionally assume that the markov decision processes and mixing time

237
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,180
then after some number of samples related to

238
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,910
the number of states actions for state the missing time perhaps long

239
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,470
you can act within epsilon delta policy

240
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,180
i don't have to be

241
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,810
so in these in these in these we did some

242
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:13,000
study about conditional independence test with and in class and

243
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,510
the then we

244
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,310
the idea here is to test condition dependence

245
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,920
we with we've we've

246
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,840
starting from the definitions

247
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,500
itself of conditional independence

248
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,990
we can we have tried to do some simulations

249
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,870
and by studying at

250
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,600
the above by

251
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,330
by testing condition dependence using distance measures between

252
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:54,100
kernel density function using euclidean distances as proposed by some

253
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,260
all told this skin

254
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:03,940
scale and reads baringhaus in france and the weighted hellinger distance was based on line

255
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:10,850
here of course we have a huge because of problems because the image and i

256
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:17,890
think is and if this is of course expected using a kind of

257
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,130
nonparametric approach which can be

258
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,840
partially mitigated using some people step procedures but

259
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,560
in case so in case when we talk about very few variables three three-foot

260
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:37,550
five and was so we can we can still use these these these methods of

261
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:43,370
but the it is indeed the case that sometimes we have few variables so we

262
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:50,020
have to test condition dependencies between very few residents so was simulation studies show that

263
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:55,390
using very few variables yes that is one can can can understand it

264
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,920
with a complete nonparametric approach

265
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:04,110
then we learn i'm going to present something about this

266
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:09,170
application of the independent component analysis part two

267
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:17,010
two recall the the the actual shocked affect the developers these the world could that

268
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:22,550
i'm doing now this is not yet finished with we don't censor but how you

269
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,200
and alex cord which we applied these

270
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:33,150
the lingam algorithm developed by patrik hoyer and and some coordinates in a paper published

271
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,150
in two thousand eight

272
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,430
the DA's hopes so

273
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,960
to estimate the reduced form VAR check that the residuals are non gaussian use an

274
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,650
independent components

275
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,920
and that's going to decompose the residuals matrix so to find

276
00:17:51,470 --> 00:18:01,140
then to find a combination of of residuals

277
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:09,130
that are independent and of course in the independent components not identified we don't we

278
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,560
don't we don't know the exact order of

279
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,570
it is independent components

280
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,180
we have

281
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,140
the idea here is to use an article we two

282
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,710
to find the permutation of the matrix

283
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,390
that is close enough to allow one to three hundred six

284
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,690
so once the instantaneous effects are identified again as in the previous publications we can

285
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,840
identify the

286
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,880
he said this is interesting is that we don't need to strong assumption

287
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,950
such as from this

288
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:55,040
just an application about that we are considering

289
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:01,290
and the for growth so we have these variables in the number of employees go

290
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,450
talk to say is going to be

291
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:11,240
research and development expenditures and profits growth rates

292
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:16,150
and we can study here the model we use

293
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:23,510
we use the least absolute deviation estimation which is much more robust to outliers and

294
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,810
and he

295
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,780
differently from the mark application that should be followed here we would we really try

296
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,400
to to study the question is we live

297
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,950
about because i

298
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:44,230
because relations among among the measure but it's not just fish effective sharks and

299
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,740
interestingly enough here we we find that

300
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,540
it is the the BBC's go in

301
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:59,190
in the infirmary which is a huge is affecting the other variables and we don't

302
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,440
find the effect

303
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:09,190
from from profits growth which is the last available on the research and development

304
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,700
show you how to prove that there is a feature space associated with such such

305
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,880
that the kernel is the dot product in the feature space

306
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,660
but before we do that we need a few artillery results

307
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,440
and actually i'm going to ask you to prove them so if you have a

308
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
pencil and paper

309
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,980
that's first go through them and then

310
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,170
take a break the five minutes

311
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,850
you can also try to prove them and then we'll do it here and this

312
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,670
is just so that you get familiar with this definition a little bit

313
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,540
so let's look at these things first actually maybe it's better i

314
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,950
use this

315
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,640
so i hope the other room now as the

316
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,560
direct connection and not just the live stream which just ten seconds delay maybe we

317
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,890
can cheque to him in the other room you should have microphones should be able

318
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,160
to say something

319
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,090
singer song or something

320
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,690
can someone from the other room

321
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,640
carpenter the microphone

322
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:14,130
maybe you can text just out of curiousity because they might be

323
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,490
you might want to ask questions or something and they might tell me that they

324
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,730
can't read the blackboard or something like that so anyway you outlets

325
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,310
take a look

326
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,810
so the first thing is

327
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,100
what if i start with the feature map and look at the dot product in

328
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,920
feature space so i compute a function of x and x prime this way i'll

329
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,380
just assume given by take two points not them into that space and then compute

330
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,050
the dot product in that space is this thing going to be

331
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,550
you don't have microphones

332
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,300
should be somewhere because we tested last week

333
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,390
OK great

334
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,050
it was OK so

335
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,120
maybe they were shouting we just didn't here

336
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:14,510
OK so this thing it turns out this thing is a positive definite kernel

337
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,820
so the kernel

338
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,670
defined this way is a positive definite kernel that's the first thing that you prove

339
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,510
second thing is called positivity on the diagonal

340
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,700
so that means

341
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,650
the diagonal values of the kernel just means substitute x in both places

342
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:36,230
nine elementary matrix diagonal elements always nonnegative

343
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,260
so that follows also from the definition of positive this thing is the cauchy schwarz

344
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:48,020
you probably on the because schwartz inequality for the product there's also cushy schwartz inequality

345
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,330
positive definite kernels

346
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,370
in fact the products are positive definite kernels but this so this is a more

347
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,680
general things

348
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,280
this is the cautious about equality and also you can try to prove that one

349
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,540
in the last thing is it turns out if the kernel vanishes on the diagonal

350
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,260
all diamonds are zero then it would be easier everywhere

351
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,440
so let's let's try to prove these things

352
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,750
and maybe just

353
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,340
to help you so you have to always use this definition so maybe that's just

354
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:29,410
write it down

355
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,060
this is what of positive definite kernels satisfies

356
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,330
now let's go to these things and you can start playing around with this definition

357
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,340
of it so in the first case you'll have to prove that

358
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,080
this is such a kernel satisfies this definition in the other cases you'll always have

359
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,170
to start with this definition and derive these statements that i have written here so

360
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:59,840
just to get familiar with the definitions of topic few minutes and then ask

361
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,770
are you doing

362
00:26:27,980 --> 00:27:40,860
so how people doing this to other people and they never resolved all the problems

363
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,820
i won't ask you to come to the black box can you can admitted if

364
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,500
you let's say who has served at least one

365
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,440
who has solved tool more

366
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,660
three or more

367
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,500
right OK so

368
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,560
it's a big mistake to one minute

369
00:28:29,460 --> 00:29:31,920
OK so let's let's look at the solutions so i can show them but

370
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,050
but maybe someone else volunteers would like to present one of them

371
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,830
on the blackboard

372
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,130
more about biblical

373
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,260
religion and biblical views of history

374
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:50,230
it was an idea that ensured the survival of the ancient israelites as an entity

375
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,750
ethnic religious and today

376
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,160
in various complicated ways

377
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,640
the view of an utterly transcendent god with absolute control over history

378
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,040
made it possible

379
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,690
for some israelites

380
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,060
to interpret even the most tragic and catastrophic events

381
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,330
such as the destruction of their capital in the example of the remaining people's

382
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,420
not the defeat of israel's god

383
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,960
or even god's rejection of them

384
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,940
but as

385
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:23,330
necessary and necessary part of god's larger purpose or plan for israel

386
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,890
these israelites left for

387
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:30,170
the record of their religious and cultural revolution in the writings that are known as

388
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:35,040
the hebrew bible collectively and this course is an introduction to the hebrew bible

389
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,540
as an expression of the religious life and thoughts of ancient israel and as the

390
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,100
foundational documents of western civilization

391
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:47,180
the course has several goals first and foremost we want to familiarize you with

392
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,140
the contents of the hebrew bible

393
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,170
and we're not gonna read every bit of it word for word we will read

394
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,430
certain chance of it quite carefully and others we work we will choose selections but

395
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:00,020
you will get a very good sense and good sampling of the contents of the

396
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:06,170
a second goal is to introduce you into two in number of approaches to the

397
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,710
of the bible different methodological approaches that have been advanced

398
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,070
by modern scholars with some of which are in fact quite old

399
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,620
at times we will play the historian

400
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,120
at times we will be literary critics

401
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,300
how does this work as literature

402
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,650
at times we will be religious and cultural critic

403
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,050
what is that the israelites were saying in their day in their time and against

404
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,310
two and for what

405
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,320
a third goal of the course is to provide some insight into the history of

406
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,990
this is a really fun part of the course of the bible's radically new conception

407
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,350
of the divine

408
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,910
it's revolutionary depiction of the human being is a moral agent

409
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,030
it's riveting saga of the nation of israel their story

410
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,510
has drawn generations of readers to ponder

411
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,390
it's meaning and message and as a result the bible has become the basis of

412
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:08,360
an enormous edifice of interpretation and commentary and debate both in traditional settings but also

413
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,940
in academic universities secular settings

414
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,420
and from time to time particularly in section discussion

415
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,850
you will have occasion to consider the ways in which certain biblical passages have been

416
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,530
interpreted sometimes in very contradictory ways over the centuries that can be in a really

417
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,000
fun and exciting part of the course

418
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,960
a fourth goal of the course is to familiarize you with

419
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,410
the the culture of ancient israel

420
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,600
as represented in the bible

421
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:40,340
against the backdrop of ancient near eastern thing junior nearest and setting

422
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,160
historical and cultural setting

423
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:48,930
because the archaeological discoveries that are referred to in the ancient near east revealed to

424
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:55,900
the spiritual and cultural heritage of all the inhabitants of the region including the israelites

425
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:00,340
and one of the major consequences of these finds is the the light that they

426
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:05,030
have shed on the background and the origins of the materials in the bible

427
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,590
so we now see that the traditions in the bible did not come out of

428
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,100
the vacuum

429
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,960
the early chapters of genesis genesis one through eleven are known as the primeval history

430
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,710
which is very unfortunate name because these chapters really are not as read or understood

431
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,960
as history in the conventional sense but

432
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,160
these eleven chapters over a great deal to ancient near eastern mythology

433
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,250
the creation story in genesis one draws upon

434
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:33,200
the babylonian epic the known as in the male each will be talking about the

435
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,670
text in some depth

436
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,750
the story of the first human pair in the garden of eden which is in

437
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,390
genesis two and three

438
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:45,030
has clear affinities with the epic of gilgamesh that's a babylonian and assyrian epic in

439
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,590
which the hero embarks on this exhausting search for immortality

440
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,970
the story of noah and the flood which occurs in genesis six

441
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:56,930
through nine it's simply an israelite version of an older flood story that we have

442
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,020
found copies of the message pertaining story called the epic adventure has

443
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:06,570
the flood story that we also have incorporated in the epic of gilgamesh biblical traditions

444
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,520
have roots that stretched deep into

445
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:15,310
in earlier times and out into the surrounding lands and traditions and the parallels between

446
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,890
the biblical stories and engineer eastern stories that they parallel

447
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,420
it has been the subject of intense study

448
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:28,890
however it isn't just the similarity between the biblical materials and the ancient near eastern

449
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,710
sources that is important to us

450
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,360
in fact in some ways the dissimilarity is remarkably

451
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,830
important as the biblical transformation

452
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:46,250
a common near eastern heritage in light of its radically new conceptions of god and

453
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,940
the world and humankind

454
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,400
i will be dealing with this in some depth but i give you one quick

455
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,320
three we have a sumerian story

456
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,290
about the third millennium

457
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,750
BCE right going back three thousand thirty one in three thousand BC

458
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,130
so the story of the usage and is very similar to the genesis

459
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,340
the flood story of noah in both of these stories the simmering in israelites story

460
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,690
you have a flood that is the result of deliberate divine decision

461
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:20,320
one individual is chosen to be rescued that individual is given very specific instructions on

462
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,600
building the boat given instructions about who to bring on board

463
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,920
the flood comes and exterminate all living things the book comes to rest on a

464
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,920
mountaintop the hero sends out birds to reconsider the land when it comes out of

465
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,600
the ark he offers to sacrifice to the god the same narrative elements are in

466
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,000
these two stories it's just wonderful when you read them side-by-side

467
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,180
what is of great significance though is not simply

468
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,310
that the biblical writer is retelling

469
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:54,590
a story that was clearly went around you know everywhere in ancient in ancient mesopotamia

470
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,800
they were transforming the story so that it became a vehicle

471
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:02,600
for the expression of their own values

472
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,500
in their own views

473
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:08,780
in the math pertaining stories for example the gods act capriciously

474
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,610
the guys act on the

475
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,330
in fact one of the stories the god people there's so noisy i can't sleep

476
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,040
let's get started

477
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,420
welcome back from lunch

478
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,760
so this morning i showed you the simplex methods the primal version the dual version

479
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,300
how to put together

480
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,330
in the two phase algorithm

481
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,200
so the problem from beginning to end

482
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,160
on in

483
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,660
i want to show you

484
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,750
one more flavor of the simplex methods

485
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,230
and then show some things uh some applications that

486
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,720
are interesting to me and i hope someone interesting to you as well

487
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,680
then on monday for the third lecturer

488
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,830
o could switch over to

489
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:00,830
nonlinear optimization convex optimization and an interior point methods for those kinds of problems

490
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,900
okay so he

491
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,790
here is the last version of the simplex method

492
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,420
called the parametric self dual

493
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,120
simplex methods it doesn't have to phases

494
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,720
like the ones i will show u earlier as the whole thing all at once

495
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,250
so to explain it let me start with

496
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:24,850
this example

497
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,670
so here we have a problem

498
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,530
primal feasible because this minus the

499
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,400
zero solution is

500
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,480
in phases and primal feasible because the minus here

501
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,440
and the dual problem would be

502
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,100
and feasible because this plus eleven this plus to the objective function

503
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,680
so in primal

504
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:49,390
in the dual

505
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,490
and that's the typical situation

506
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,090
and the question is what should we do about it

507
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,420
idea here

508
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,170
is to introduce

509
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:09,860
if you like both a fake object function fake right-hand side all ones

510
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,850
um but also a parametric manner

511
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,030
so we have this parameter mu

512
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,640
that appears in the objective function

513
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,040
and it appears in the right hand side

514
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:26,350
so i'm adding five plus one new four plus one new six plus one year and so forth

515
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,720
so these are being added and these are being subtracted

516
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,670
and the point of doing this is that from very large

517
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,840
the solution associated with this dictionary in other words only x is equal to zero

518
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,100
will be optimal

519
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,800
because for me is sufficiently large all these things will be positive

520
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,880
and all these things all these coefficients will be negative

521
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,670
that's what it takes to be out o can be improved

522
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,830
in fact we can figure out exactly

523
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,860
what value of u

524
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,060
achieves the

525
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,070
by running down a bunch inequalities which i think i have shown

526
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,120
probably on the next slide

527
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,370
you may be able do it on the board so is here so you can

528
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,900
see it as i do it

529
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,710
we want

530
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,140
we live

531
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,530
minus three

532
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,720
minus mu

533
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,230
today a negative number

534
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:21,690
we want

535
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,170
minus mu

536
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,000
to be a negative number

537
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,710
we want to

538
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:28,850
minus mu

539
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,620
to be a negative number

540
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,710
we want five plus mutiny positive

541
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,920
we want four plus

542
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,630
community positive we want six plus mu to be positive

543
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,330
almost outer space but just making here minus four plus mu

544
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:47,700
to be positive

545
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,100
we rewrite these things that says that new is greater equal to

546
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:52,500
minus three

547
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,470
that's sort of no problem

548
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,100
this is new is greater than or equal to eleven

549
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,270
this is mu new is greater than or equal to two

550
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,820
this one says mu is

551
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,320
greater equal to minus five

552
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,250
this one says mu is greater than equal to minus four r and this one

553
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,130
says mu is able to minus six

554
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,400
and this one says mu is greater than or equal to the fore

555
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,680
we take intersection walls and plot them on

556
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,310
the new line

557
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,330
the all greater equal something in the

558
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,740
the most stringent one is this one here

559
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,090
new has to be greater than or equal to eleven

560
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,060
so far although is a new

561
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,670
equal to eleven

562
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:43,130
x one x two x three all equal to zero would be optimal for this problem

563
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,430
at mu equals eleven

564
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,410
we get we we we had the borderline here

565
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,870
it's still optimal

566
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:54,720
what happens in development is and for the most part the growth of neurons is

567
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,390
for the most part pruning

568
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,100
getting rid of neurons

569
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:02,710
so the neural structures change radically as baby is going to get rid of excess

570
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,580
neurons through development at the same time though

571
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,140
the connections between neurons

572
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,140
grow like crazy

573
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:16,870
and the and this this process of synaptic growth waters the connections across different synapses

574
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,380
peaks at about two years

575
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,770
finally remember myelination

576
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:25,490
where you sort of get this fatty sheath or neuron to make it more effective

577
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,390
that also happens through development and

578
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:32,040
and in fact it goes for development and even teenagers

579
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:36,800
are not fully my located in particular are not fully my limited in their frontal

580
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,020
lobes recall the frontal lobes are involved in things like restraint and will power

581
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:48,560
and so it could be the problem is the baby's brain doesn't develop here

582
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,300
another possibility is

583
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,150
this problems with inhibitor

584
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,800
this is related to get into the frontal lobes and this comes up with a

585
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,730
not be here

586
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:00,820
so remember

587
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,390
the baby reaches

588
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,630
reaches reach is is moved reach follow

589
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,190
he's reaching the same place

590
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,300
and it could be the babies don't know anything about objects but another possibility is

591
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:16,560
once you do something it's kind of hard to stop it takes a bit of

592
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,100
control to stop

593
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,790
and there's all sorts of independent evidence that babies lack this control part of our

594
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,360
brain that control

595
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,060
certain behaviours

596
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:29,210
it's just not active here

597
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,520
there's a very nice illustration

598
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:35,230
inhibitory problems from the simpsons episodes

599
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,240
that actually sort covers anything you might want to know

600
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,960
about developmental differences

601
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,780
basically made some of my to developmental psychology

602
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,590
the trial that the child essentially

603
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,580
he does a a a it's moving

604
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,120
and he keeps going forward

605
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:59,440
and there is some evidence that's true a dell diamond study this finds that are

606
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,530
located reach for a look for b

607
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,670
as if it they know it's there but it can stop themselves from reaching

608
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,120
and will continue to seem a little bit later

609
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:16,090
maybe kids don't know that's something you've got to work

610
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,940
and this is true

611
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,510
in all sorts of domains in the social world and economic world in the political

612
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:25,440
world and it's true as well in the physical world

613
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,720
in fact there's some things even adults don't know

614
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,760
so so here's a study by michael mccluskey with college students

615
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,300
here's the idea

616
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,090
you have it two

617
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,140
a transparent tube a hollow tube

618
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,290
and at the top of the two

619
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,010
you throw a ball through

620
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,630
so what's through the two and comes out

621
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:49,900
the question is

622
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,330
what happens to it

623
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,740
the goal in the path of a

624
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,560
what is going to have to be

625
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,980
without looking around the world for a

626
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,010
who votes for b

627
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,770
here's the weird thing whenever i do this at yale

628
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:09,040
everybody gets the damn thing right

629
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,340
johns hopkins fifty fifty

630
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:14,800
for a and b

631
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,200
i got to get better demo but anyway

632
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,210
college students

633
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,350
not here

634
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,060
show systematic biases of incorrect physical

635
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,290
here's the twist

636
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:30,730
and if you want it if you if you found people who were less

637
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:34,060
wonderful the new and and ask them you get a lot of people saying the

638
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,560
but here's the twist as somebody what if you took the two

639
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:43,670
and new squirted water through it we would water

640
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,220
nobody chooses b

641
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:48,260
everybody knows the water would continue in a straight line

642
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,410
suggest that when you have experience that helps you up and absence of experience

643
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,470
you kind of lost

644
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:00,060
we've talked about the physical world what about the social world what about the world

645
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,050
of people

646
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,020
well there's a lot of research on this as well

647
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,890
baby start off with some social preferences

648
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,420
if you take newborn babies

649
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,290
it's very hard to do research of newborn babies actually because the

650
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,160
consent procedure and everything so most of this work is done in france

651
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:23,680
and listing them defining class listening instances is also a lot of help you

652
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,720
two five

653
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,810
and alpha

654
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:28,140
the gates are open

655
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,810
what i will do have said most of this so i will

656
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:40,720
skip it instead i want to do is just provide information yes this is notable

657
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:47,950
trilogy so these are all the holocaust structures near the description logic

658
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:54,060
constructors to this is to substantiate this claim that all is just a description logic

659
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,720
is an XML syntax

660
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,600
and in

661
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:06,760
what's important is that i said well this XML syntax XML syntax is just as

662
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,540
unreliable as the RDF syntax is the same

663
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:17,310
you really don't want to read this and so on

664
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:22,640
therefore we design design difference is that the forms for the same language so one

665
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,520
in particular interesting cases there's human motivation from

666
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:33,470
humility sort of widely used in industry in data modeling and also large communities is

667
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,870
and there's a URL notation

668
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,180
four flowers

669
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,140
it's like

670
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:50,810
in some of the level of master so there's is no i don't know any

671
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,560
does that

672
00:46:53,580 --> 00:47:00,450
OK there is also an alternative XML syntax which is already more readable for humans

673
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:06,510
and interesting there is a what's called the abstract syntax the last rites abstract collapsed

674
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:11,330
because called concrete but this is much more human readable and i will give some

675
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:16,200
examples of how in terms of abstract syntax and of course you can mechanically translate

676
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,240
in and out of city centre

677
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,720
so i will not spend the last few slides give you some flavours of what

678
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,370
you can do with OWL abstract syntax

679
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:29,430
just remembered for everything you look at there's really a piece of RDF XML serialisation

680
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,140
is about five times the size

681
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:38,220
before i do that i forgot there's also a list of things that doesn't

682
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:42,620
which is really important to mention that these are simple questions again get after out

683
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,810
presentations no i'll doesn't do people

684
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:48,620
so you can not have the typical examples

685
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,290
but always line except in a subclass of birds don't fly

686
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:59,580
because it becomes nonmonotonic and we don't have proper formalizations of that for is we

687
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:05,640
cannot agree on one so it will drive for standardization teaching already mentioned we don't

688
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:11,390
the closed world assumption that deliberately open world assumption you could not do property chaining

689
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,020
is also known as rules

690
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,890
OK so you can define what it means to be a sister of

691
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:19,890
brother of you can define what it means to be a father of but you

692
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,890
can define uncle over the composition of those

693
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,080
that's too

694
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:25,580
two to

695
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:29,510
the decidability of the language so you want to define rules saying now x is

696
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:32,120
the uncle of y if there is some z where

697
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:36,830
x the brother of z y z is the father of why that rule

698
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:41,490
language is in the making there is a good proposal by you ought to be

699
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:45,930
to build snyder and that's the obvious way to go before warm clauses were all

700
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,950
literals in the clause expressions

701
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:52,310
so the obvious thing to do when they wrote it down good

702
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:57,370
play and you should feel free to use it if you want to

703
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:01,040
OK those are the most important restrictions on movement for time

704
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,560
here are some examples

705
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:08,120
these are

706
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,560
these are

707
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,720
is the answer

708
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:17,220
so there is no good

709
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,240
the semantics of what it would mean to do inferencing for all club

710
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,180
good question

711
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:28,060
there's a related restriction which is a unique name assumption which is also here how

712
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:31,330
can just because two things have a different names

713
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,040
you cannot infer therefore there are different things

714
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,430
it may turn out later

715
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:38,370
these two names correctly two names for

716
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:43,450
different for the same thing so we use different from databases typically database made unique

717
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,520
name assumption

718
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:49,410
match say OK this that each one of those could conceivably match some look like

719
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:53,670
and some dance some this some more each one for each

720
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,830
disparity each mostly matching pixel

721
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,260
you can give score

722
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:00,880
how well it matches and score

723
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:05,110
each of the d one to d and can be

724
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,330
different schools of pixels

725
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:13,270
and so you that usually something like colour consistency standards

726
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,740
the intensity i is intensity left image minus the intensity of the right image

727
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,410
probably square them and add them

728
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,210
all pixels then you have to find the pdf etc etc etc etc etc but

729
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,940
if you do that which minimizes this cost

730
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,450
try to to minimize the possibility if you do that usually you get somewhat noisy

731
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,890
image noisy depthmap

732
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:41,900
some reason this picks looks like the right one here but

733
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,750
the one above it doesn't really apply the same because after all of that from

734
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,690
the point of view so usually you put some other

735
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:54,040
type term in there which is called the regularisation term the smoothness term which says

736
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,910
pixels junior each other

737
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,260
near each other in three dimensions and hence have

738
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:08,310
and we don't worry too much about that

739
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:11,780
regularisation term other than to say there is one so

740
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,960
here is

741
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,710
what you get

742
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,380
if you take independent

743
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,590
one by one

744
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,280
i should say this also uses the technique

745
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:24,090
called well

746
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,400
dynamic programming which in fact

747
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:30,310
smooth them out and gives you

748
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,690
you better to pixel by pixel

749
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:36,490
but this ground truth is what you get from and scandalised the trouble is that

750
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:39,240
each individual scan lines done separately

751
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:45,860
and they don't really match up if you put the appropriate regularisation term something considered

752
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:49,960
using graph cuts and graph cuts techniques are

753
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:54,470
so that explains the exterior days

754
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,640
this is have look at

755
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,350
what graph cuts is all about

756
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,070
it's really that you have a graph

757
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,440
and you want to say separate separating two parts

758
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,480
you've got to find

759
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,650
between a few places the red all the red pixels by

760
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,330
and the forth

761
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:24,390
think t on the other side i usually called zero and one my slides of

762
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:27,070
people called s and t for source

763
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,650
and terminal i guess

764
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:30,360
then the question is

765
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:31,860
how do you find

766
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:32,780
the best

767
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,910
of separating the graph

768
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,710
what is the best way

769
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,530
each of those edges will have some sort of

770
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,230
or costs associated with it

771
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:49,410
the purpose is to find the least cost cut between those

772
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,200
so i can see how you think you can see how that

773
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:57,620
general idea would apply this mosaic thing have to find the least cost cuts

774
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,370
along the graph

775
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,330
and one of the nice things about this is

776
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:05,860
unlike many of the problems

777
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,080
in fact the general problem

778
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:11,690
in this area of suitable optimisation it can be done

779
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,340
in polynomial time

780
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:17,500
we look at some of these organisms

781
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,610
the ford focus goes back to nineteen sixty two

782
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,530
the way this works

783
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:27,120
is that you

784
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:29,890
if you look at this

785
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,530
you want to find out what is the best cut

786
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:37,320
between this each of those pages has a certain way which is represented here

787
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:41,400
graphically by its thickness so then you you look at

788
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:43,090
from source

789
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:49,660
so this is a little bit inexact they exact was going on be careful

790
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,520
we find

791
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:54,610
a path through that in the sense you sort of

792
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,240
think of these things the network of pipes and you can push a certain amount

793
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,140
of water through the pipes

794
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:00,960
and you

795
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:04,230
push some water some fluid flows

796
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,490
when flow

797
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:09,610
from source to sink and once you've done that

798
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:12,110
you can

799
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,880
take away that sort of past that amount st from each those parts and then

800
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,540
go on to the next one

801
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,100
until you cannot

802
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:25,820
you find another another part to push along until you cannot push any more fly

803
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,410
along any more

804
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:29,520
constructively interfere

805
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:31,900
to form a pi bond

806
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:36,200
which is the carbon two PY carbon two PY

807
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:46,880
every double bond is to find way it's doable with every double bond is made

808
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,600
up of one

809
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,490
sigma bond

810
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,340
and a sigma bond is always

811
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:56,460
the overlap between two

812
00:54:56,470 --> 00:55:00,780
two s e two hybrid wavefunctions

813
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:06,040
and the second bond that always makes up the double bond is the pi bond

814
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:12,360
pi bond is always the overlap of two atomic wavefunctions

815
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:15,090
in the case your carbonate two

816
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,720
two p wave functions that have overlap

817
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:23,190
right that's what a double bond always is

818
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,840
it always is so whether it's the carbon double bond or nitrogen double bond or

819
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,970
an oxygen double bond is always one sigma

820
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:34,240
one part i

821
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:38,040
all right and there the hydrogen

822
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:41,560
and as we said those hydrogens there

823
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:47,600
carbon hydrogen bond is overlap between carbon two SP two

824
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,160
weight functions

825
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:54,020
and that hydrogen one s wave function

826
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,560
now what's the geometry of that we

827
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,770
well the geometry here

828
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,700
the point is that

829
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:06,220
the hydrogen carbon hydrogen bonds are one hundred and twenty degrees

830
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:12,150
that's one hundred twenty degrees because there is the result of the hybridisation that two

831
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,890
sp two hybridization

832
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,330
of the

833
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,410
wavefunctions around the harbour

834
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:23,970
this prime here is one hundred twenty degrees again because of the

835
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:29,110
two sp two hybridization around the carbon

836
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,780
the geometry of the molecule is planar

837
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,990
all these animals are in the plane all six atoms are in the plane

838
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,470
the binding those here are all hundred and twenty degrees

839
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,520
OK now

840
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:49,460
if you see i current that's got double bond

841
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:55,290
if you see nitrogen that guided albion to see an oxygen it's got double bond

842
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,580
there is always the call

843
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,590
carbon and nitrogen and oxygen

844
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,800
the hybridisation of two sp two

845
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:12,920
o double bond here at this hybridization always

846
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:19,050
so if you're in to tell what the hybridisation is around some and got double

847
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,470
blind to it

848
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,770
it's a two sp two hybrid

849
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:36,680
what i wanna do is i want to take this two sp two hybrid

850
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,830
and build little

851
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:40,460
larger molecules

852
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:46,440
i'm going to take this parents who are going to take the two problems here

853
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,980
that are bonded

854
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:50,670
here this

855
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:55,740
two sp two hydrogens so here ideas so one

856
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:59,420
here's another two and kind of strategically placed

857
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:01,960
what it is i want to do

858
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,250
and of course this is the

859
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,470
a sigma bond between the two departments

860
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:09,500
carbon to us two

861
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,830
here's the carbon

862
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,580
two sp two sigma bonds

863
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:18,090
right now i'm i'm going to do

864
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:22,630
is that i'm going to bring in another carbon

865
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:26,750
there is sp two hybridized

866
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:29,180
here it comes

867
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,510
and again it's strategically oriented

868
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,080
so that right here

869
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,670
i have now formed another

870
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:44,000
by another sigma bond between the carbon two sp two a function

871
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:44,930
the other

872
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:49,420
carpenter with weight function in the same thing right here

873
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:54,270
i just form two other sigma bonds

874
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,110
and now

875
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:57,250
i'm going to bring in

876
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:00,710
as the two

877
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:07,920
and it's going to come in from the side and again it's strategically oriented

878
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,830
so i just for here

879
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,300
i another sigma bond between these two problems

880
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:19,860
and another sigma bond between these two problems

881
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,520
look at that

882
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,410
he e

883
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:29,940
yearning to look alot like benzene

884
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,670
that might be required

885
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:53,840
they're hired to say is going to be banned the

886
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:56,880
all right so what i do here

887
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:00,900
i made some sigma

888
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:03,730
i made six sigma bonds

889
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:06,030
right between the current

890
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,930
two sp two wavefunction

891
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,390
and the hydrogen what wavefunctions

892
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:19,190
so now i got all of my atoms here in almost all of my part

893
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,250
we've got to do something here

894
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,350
half and how helen left actually know

895
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,290
one forty minutes not that

896
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:36,810
i would say that is what is interesting here is that for linear system only

897
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:38,250
it is easy

898
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:47,370
is it is easier to study the dynamical system using an input output representation in

899
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:51,440
taking into account the memory of the system through

900
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,650
this impulse response function

901
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,810
but only in this case can do this kind of of

902
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:07,250
anyway i feel able

903
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:13,310
move from the a state space representation

904
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:20,580
two in input output representation in dynamic systems i've always have to think

905
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:25,850
o two very important notions which are

906
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:33,690
crucial notion think that are one of the most important part of this lecture four

907
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:39,960
this two results related to the concept of reachability the notions related to the concept

908
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,210
of reachability

909
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:43,810
end of ability

910
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:50,330
as you that generic state is reachable

911
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:56,900
if there exists a certain time is that certain input to that can

912
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:05,020
bring the state the into certain improve the for into the state x

913
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:12,830
translating this notion means they're acting properly to the system with the search function u

914
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:16,370
i can always take my system

915
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,670
from a certain point to another one

916
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:23,630
so reachability means that i'm able to

917
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:25,670
manipulating the system

918
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:28,460
using our input variables

919
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:32,630
in order to support the systems data into

920
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:38,170
the state space into the point of the state space which is my goal

921
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:43,020
this is somewhat related to control

922
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:46,850
taking into account that not is not always true

923
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:49,190
the state is reachable

924
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:56,350
given a certain input i can even never arrive to assert state so this this

925
01:02:56,350 --> 01:03:00,190
means that the system or single state is not reachable

926
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,980
by my actions

927
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:03,830
so this is very

928
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:09,370
also when we are going to model that this kind of system in the second

929
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:15,170
notion is even more important in this of survival

930
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:24,250
also the well is defined the starting from the definition of unobservable this that certain

931
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:30,460
in state the different from zero is an observable is

932
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:36,610
for a certain period of time in the output zero even if the state is

933
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:38,750
not zero

934
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:43,680
so this is the example actually we have to state that well we have a

935
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:50,130
certain trajectories over time of the state variables but we don't observe

936
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:52,250
we do not observe

937
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:55,040
any changes in the output

938
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:02,960
of course if you can understand these instances dramatic for

939
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,600
modelling of time series

940
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:12,310
it tells you that something is is happening inside the system

941
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:14,880
which i'm not able to observe

942
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:17,500
but but the state changes

943
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,650
i have different

944
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:27,380
initial state for example for certain here with respect to this point here

945
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:30,870
so you have a situation

946
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,920
in which our system

947
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,100
cannot be

948
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:37,810
reported into an input output representation

949
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:44,650
so for example for linear systems something which i would like to do

950
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:53,110
here i report what is called the kalman the composition of linear systems

951
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:58,920
in my point of view can be considered a good way of thinking

952
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:04,310
in general of dynamic systems even if they are not lead the composition can cannot

953
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:06,540
be performed except

954
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:09,170
but this test that the system

955
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:11,040
you can have four

956
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:16,670
one component is a component which is

957
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:20,440
the best one what we this one what we like

958
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:23,100
which is reachable and observable

959
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:28,770
this means that if i hacked into the system i'm able to put the system

960
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:30,440
state what i want

961
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:37,150
and if i am observing the system i observe the output is a function complete

962
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:40,350
of the state variable so

963
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,190
if i and performing

964
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:48,650
in the input output experiment i'm able to observe everything to control

965
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:53,040
it may happen

966
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:59,130
that even our output and all input to the portions of the system

967
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:03,250
reachable but not observable

968
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:08,420
so i'm going to the system something but don't of sort of anything

969
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:12,650
in this sometimes happens to make people that nervous

970
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:17,290
because because they try to manipulate the system that kind of sort of anything so

971
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:21,960
that it doesn't change but of course is not true it doesn't change because you

972
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,040
are not measuring the the right out with your notes

973
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:27,940
o serving the right state variables

974
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:32,540
the second part here

975
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:37,440
is that we have something which is reachable but observable

976
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:42,770
i have my system is under nominal conditions i'm not doing anything to the system

977
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:48,250
i'm observing was going on and this is something i said oh my god what's

978
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,940
happening whose main relating this is

979
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,440
external disturbances

980
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,130
and this is what is typically called noise

981
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:58,460
we observe something

982
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,080
which is

983
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,650
we say well noise

984
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:03,400
OK but maybe

985
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:10,100
something different is time noise thermal noise which would mean that i have a parliamentary

986
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:15,730
which is the temperature which changes with a with that but i mean i can't

987
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,130
manage using the input

988
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:22,060
and this causes some out OK

989
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:29,650
we have the worst of the worst situation which is the situation in which the

990
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:31,500
system is unreachable

991
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,870
a part of the system is unreachable and not observable

992
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:45,440
it means that a portion of the system is behaving in a completely unmanageable way

993
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:50,150
unfortunately nature some parts of the dynamical system

994
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:56,190
always present so i can do anything about it and maybe i can serve them

995
01:07:56,190 --> 01:08:00,430
let's please let

996
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:06,110
we can use it means for nation

997
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,900
location location

998
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:23,370
and then what is that lot of

999
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:26,600
and this is one of

1000
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:32,720
OK thanks a lot everyone for coming waking up it seems to me now so

1001
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,730
what i talk about is basically dynamics and put

1002
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:40,960
temporal dynamics of of networks meaning large graphs so we'll be taking graphs some kind

1003
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,350
of data we try to analyse model

1004
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:47,650
but if first if you're going to think about what we have today is basically

1005
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:52,790
we have a large on line systems that have traces of human social and other

1006
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:57,720
types of activities right so for example we have online communities like facebook that have

1007
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:03,290
like myspace account like millions or hundreds of millions of users and and again see

1008
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:09,210
that using this computing applications we have some of the activity right similarly for communication

1009
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,960
have a lot that i like instant messenger

1010
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:16,470
or four news and social media we have blogs and the estimate is that there

1011
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:21,770
are two hundred fifty million blogs worldwide today and again we can easily grow

1012
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:26,390
crawl blogs and for example observed in for how information propagates from block to block

1013
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:31,850
and what also have like online worlds like second life and world of warcraft that

1014
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:38,150
what's on that only have internal economies in terms of GDP and so on so

1015
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:42,590
these are sort of different applications that there exists today and like millions of people

1016
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:47,400
are using the using the so what is allows us to is to study phenomena

1017
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:52,670
and behaviour is basically the skills that were before pretty much impossible

1018
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:57,160
the second point is that most of these data is some kind of interaction right

1019
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:01,300
so went to people need to something to talk to one another and such interaction

1020
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,680
best modelled by network by right so for example

1021
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:08,970
we can model of social networks as graph meaning that no here will be a

1022
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:12,930
person and an edge between two two people some kind of interaction with the thought

1023
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:17,370
that friends or something similar on the web we have web pages on the web

1024
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:21,860
pages of knowledge and we have hyperlinks between the links in the graph again he

1025
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:27,040
is is is a network of communication as i said like email exchanges

1026
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:31,550
citation networks another example and biological networks sort of

1027
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,150
another example of

1028
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,290
the city each network data

1029
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,780
if we go and see what we we know about the structure of these networks

1030
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:44,030
i would like know a lot about how so for example you know a lot

1031
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:46,350
about the properties of these networks

1032
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:50,330
you know things like the scale free if you know the clustering of the data

1033
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:55,310
that we can navigate through the you know they composed bipartite cores and so on

1034
01:10:56,110 --> 01:11:02,290
and i think is that each of structures as we observed that we also have

1035
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:07,170
good models to to understand so for example of models like preferential attachment where the

1036
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:10,760
idea is that you are more likely to connect to high degree nodes and low

1037
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:14,520
degree nodes of high degree webpages and loading degree web pages you know like the

1038
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,960
small world model the copying model and some other ones OK so

1039
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,850
we know a lot about sort of structure of static networks but let me know

1040
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:24,410
much less about is the

1041
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:28,690
is the processes and dynamics of these networks and basically this is the topic of

1042
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:30,060
this thing

1043
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:34,550
so the far the focus will be on three different points so first point will

1044
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,010
be about network evolution so the main question here would be

1045
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:43,080
how does the network structure change and evolve as the network grows over time

1046
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:44,750
OK so that's the first

1047
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:49,050
sort of the first part second part to be a different type of dynamics now

1048
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:53,430
we'll assume we have an article and something is probably going so so the question

1049
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:55,970
how do more diseases information

1050
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:00,860
influence propagates in such networks how can one and how can you explain

1051
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:05,980
and sort of the central park because the disease is is large so basically what

1052
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:08,420
kind of benefit i'm getting from large

1053
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:12,980
and as i've shown here in in in a few examples of what can happen

1054
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:15,610
is that means that many many times c

1055
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:19,760
psi phenomena to be able to one things that practically invisible if you if you

1056
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,410
don't look at you know

1057
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:26,100
OK so to go into more detail that the plan for the day and please

1058
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,890
don't get scared right so we have these three

1059
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:31,060
three lines of work so

1060
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:36,740
evolution cascade and examples of large data and then each of these three lines sort

1061
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:42,530
of have to but first we see some empirical observations and then we lost modelling

1062
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:46,430
it's an intractable scenario in the sense that well

1063
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:47,650
you cannot

1064
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:51,900
nice to decompose all the planning operations

1065
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,990
and you get essentially the same algebra occurring in

1066
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,260
now rather than

1067
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,150
some in

1068
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:02,500
we have the

1069
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:04,760
i mean in plus some simmering

1070
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:08,650
there's also the and and or so you can also use logics for it or

1071
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:09,660
you can use

1072
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:13,220
log plus plus

1073
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:16,960
if you want to work with low probabilities

1074
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:18,490
the beauty of this is

1075
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,480
you can write your system

1076
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,930
and instantiate

1077
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:23,680
a different semirings

1078
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:29,710
you get a large range of different operations quite easily fought

1079
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,120
the beauty is that

1080
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:36,230
you can basically invented the different hearing right to different pavement intended to different conference

1081
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:41,510
which people have done

1082
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:48,100
so this was

1083
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:50,560
message passing

1084
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:53,650
on the junction tree

1085
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,640
the problem with this

1086
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:59,050
with this intractable models

1087
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:04,920
well with even with factor models they scales exponentially in the treewidth

1088
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,760
if in fact junction tree

1089
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:10,290
it gets very expensive because you have to send in same through a really really

1090
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,480
long message

1091
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:16,470
so this is what the OP asked before about optimality and so on

1092
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:19,660
and the

1093
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:23,720
use of message passing may or may not converge i mean there are now some

1094
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:29,100
theoretical guarantees we essentially you're on the convergence monitor at the same time with the

1095
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,980
same operations as you actually junction tree

1096
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:35,100
so as the actually loopy belief propagation

1097
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:39,680
and if the convergence monitor converges then you know also the algorithm has converged which

1098
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,440
kind of OK

1099
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,840
there's a few other workarounds

1100
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,560
you can

1101
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:50,080
well look at subset of the graph

1102
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:54,620
and well solved inference problem with this and then the average of the spanning trees

1103
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:58,390
so that's the embedded trees algorithm of will get out

1104
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,680
then or the alternative is use sampling methods for inference

1105
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:06,000
they guess those are actually the most promising ones

1106
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:09,900
there's a couple of open problems in this context because they

1107
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:13,890
depend quite a bit on how you decompose a graph and how you sample

1108
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:20,150
as far as i know no very good definitive answers have been obtained so far

1109
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:24,320
in terms of what the sampling operate

1110
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,130
you know why

1111
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:28,710
what you would be out to look for

1112
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:31,300
the spectrum

1113
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:32,640
off here

1114
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:38,710
propagation operating time through sampling the case as you compose them

1115
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:43,810
there's a couple of interesting questions in this context the result

1116
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:45,880
now here's another way

1117
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,280
well we use convexity

1118
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:52,570
about a year and a half ago i would have said well this is actually

1119
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:57,740
quite a nice idea and i imagine that this can lead to practical algorithms

1120
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:59,840
at the moment i would say

1121
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:04,200
it can lead to very good theoretical insight unfortunately don't use it in practice it's

1122
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,860
just slightly

1123
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:09,660
maybe you can make it run fast but

1124
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,690
not so sure

1125
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:13,850
what we do is

1126
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:16,140
we take we look at the bag of

1127
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:19,810
well tricks from convex duality

1128
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:30,240
keep paper in this case will be the one by wainwright and jordan

1129
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,740
no NIPS

1130
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,460
o three

1131
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:40,740
and there is long take report about the a hundred pages which builds on that

1132
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:44,180
and manages to unify a couple of inference algorithms

1133
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:46,210
in this context

1134
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,600
so that's it

1135
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:51,070
you might want to read the fort version

1136
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:53,810
the first ten pages maybe

1137
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:58,550
the that pain on you with a hundred pages but essentially that's the key

1138
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:03,160
a place where this trick was proposed

1139
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:06,690
the log partition function this function g theta

1140
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:13,290
use of these concept OK for solution i use it is risk these

1141
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:21,580
the rule that they extracted to describe the concept time predicting but practically the final

1142
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:26,730
goal is this one OK can use this part to sort of this part and

1143
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:32,170
and they can use this discovered back two-minute data for example i can perform query

1144
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:38,210
the formal of i want to select all the side of what is not

1145
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:45,750
well at the salle the landscape so automatically query of this form will generate a

1146
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:51,230
list of size away by applying defeat the operational definition it is embedded in the

1147
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:56,330
landscape if these are the official matches the description of the site it is a

1148
01:17:56,330 --> 01:18:03,230
selective dis that can be used to all my new online and in this case

1149
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:09,290
we have performed some experimental value but just to check if a rule extract the

1150
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:14,770
effectively predictive so we use it only for a positive example and nine negative examples

1151
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:23,650
and a bistable we assigned to the results that we obtain on the entire model

1152
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:26,940
in the case of one of the ground knowledge to we can look at it

1153
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:33,940
and we can see that all around the running time of icarus and these are

1154
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:36,150
different statistics to

1155
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:44,080
describe the classification we can see that the precision and recall and

1156
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:49,590
background knowledge a lot to the work of precision so we have the more descriptive

1157
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:58,020
by tend to perform better when we practical use the for classification task OK just

1158
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:03,190
to conclude that this is only an query that i'm unclear language it is just

1159
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:08,170
maybe text that should be expanded to four

1160
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:10,270
in different ways

1161
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:15,350
the main idea is that the case is not just a statistic

1162
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:22,790
need to but the statistic representation of dates back to drive a query

1163
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:28,790
red band performing was about to step but it's a solution to the problem of

1164
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:35,690
of integration of different technology because OK just to is use the that

1165
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:41,310
users just to formulate a query and the query seem to summarize the entire data

1166
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:47,810
mining process and in this case the query is different from the traditional mining query

1167
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:54,040
language because it does that also the different problems and does our work is continuing

1168
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:59,810
on this topic because we are working on discrete cosine and so on extending the

1169
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:06,100
mining so just to integrate different tools that we have to perform

1170
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:07,730
that can

1171
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:25,170
that fact

1172
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:37,830
well that

1173
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,370
where are you

1174
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:44,250
the long

1175
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:57,580
o five one one side

1176
01:20:57,730 --> 01:21:03,790
OK then side is contains some ninety seven

1177
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:11,460
ninety seven but you have to consider that one extract description of its and

1178
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:19,400
complete description of sala the story in the first order representation it is about twenty

1179
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:27,400
so you have a lot of descriptor for its opposite values than that of these

1180
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:32,960
and on his experiment with the internet of these i have not so allow for

1181
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,290
performing test and so this is the

1182
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:39,940
in rule that they extracted by use all the positive example and all the negative

1183
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:44,830
examples but in this case i interesting legacy again on the floor and escape what

1184
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:45,910
of these

1185
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:49,410
substructure age

1186
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:54,220
and you can see that all cosets form the entire entire playing with the

1187
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:57,130
can you see this picture i think the red is

1188
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:00,770
hard to

1189
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:06,300
in in this case this case there i was meaning subspace

1190
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:12,830
this is the extent natural group

1191
01:22:12,830 --> 01:22:16,490
and more shipwrecks structure but here i'm just

1192
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:20,270
i'm this considered here the analogy of the

1193
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:23,600
of the euclidean space with the

1194
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:24,970
this group

1195
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:26,260
of the group

1196
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:27,500
and here

1197
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,720
you have for example the analogy is that x

1198
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:35,410
o is the subgroup h

1199
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:38,320
is there any point

1200
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,660
this of the subgroup is age

1201
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:57,120
in this case is the x

1202
01:22:57,170 --> 01:22:59,540
axis x

1203
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:03,440
and the shifted copies of these subgroups

1204
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:09,980
are two parallel line and i blocked them of course you have as many as

1205
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:15,600
are the number of points in that the y x

1206
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:17,380
and so

1207
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:18,870
a course sect

1208
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:24,140
a core set of

1209
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:44,360
in this case the identities zero

1210
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:48,990
in this case here the knowledge there the right side with the group

1211
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:53,260
is that the of is the group that this the points the coordinates of the

1212
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,420
points there

1213
01:23:54,440 --> 01:24:01,370
and then you have the operation is just the the standard translation in the plane

1214
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:05,230
so you have you have

1215
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,410
if you multiply that because that is

1216
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:12,370
and number c one times all elements of h

1217
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:13,640
you get the

1218
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,350
the c one line there

1219
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,200
the first one

1220
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:20,690
this one

1221
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:27,700
this line here

1222
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,070
so this is the this is one that

1223
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:33,650
this line here is analogous that

1224
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:35,730
and with this picture is it too

1225
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:39,810
two semantic properties of those schools

1226
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:43,220
the first thing that you all the over

1227
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:45,400
the quantum right corner

1228
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:48,710
is that the identity must be long

1229
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,760
two h

1230
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:53,260
because h is a subgroup

1231
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,350
so as it is subgroup it has to have

1232
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:57,670
and identity

1233
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:59,220
it has the former group

1234
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:01,680
so the identity has to be the

1235
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:05,050
so the identity is only in h

1236
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,360
so the core set

1237
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:11,310
they do not necessarily form social groups

1238
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:20,550
and here in red probably can read that report

1239
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:23,980
that cosets form a partition

1240
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:27,040
of the group

1241
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:31,390
in this case it forms the partition of the subspace if you take all those

1242
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:34,680
for all c

1243
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:37,150
you cover to cover space

1244
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,440
so the core sets

1245
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:40,880
you can decompose the space

1246
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:46,130
in the collection of course it's

1247
01:25:46,170 --> 01:25:48,190
the last thing here

1248
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,630
is this blue

1249
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:56,880
if you take one point of the space

1250
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,540
there's is only one cassette

1251
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:03,800
this based on the this point belongs to

1252
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:05,830
only one

1253
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:10,200
so you take for any and point here the other one for example belongs to

1254
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,130
this is day

1255
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:15,380
another point here would belong focus across crossing there

1256
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:16,460
and to

1257
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:18,640
that concept only

1258
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:29,390
that's why we're we're going to talk about here we need some generalizations in this

1259
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:30,690
case here

1260
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,580
the group operation

1261
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,070
but we are

1262
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,320
using to construct

1263
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,620
course that

1264
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:41,970
is this vector a vector addition right

1265
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,810
you might like see here

1266
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:46,390
all points here the age

1267
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,930
and you get a higher level sets

1268
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,190
that's the idea of parallel said that we have to

1269
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:56,870
you know in this simple case the multiplication is

1270
01:26:58,170 --> 01:27:00,310
i could be in a group

1271
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:03,160
which can get

1272
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:06,350
quite abstract

1273
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:09,310
so this is just the

1274
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,710
to reflect the

1275
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:15,190
because open as i will be talking about sets in many contexts

1276
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,470
you have to be aware

1277
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:22,840
this this sort of reasoning can happen

1278
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,970
you know you get and you get a bit lost

1279
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:28,560
with all these definitions

1280
01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:31,170
but they are important properties

1281
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:36,050
this case here it's an old joy no the lawyer joke

1282
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:39,410
person can correctly say

1283
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:44,870
o we can correctly say of them they'd be better off dead

1284
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,030
let me try to draw

1285
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,070
some examples

1286
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:54,230
again we're bracketing the question can the person

1287
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:59,450
i think clearly about their case that come later let's just try to talk about

1288
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:03,370
when i was a suicide makes sense

1289
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:04,880
well would be

1290
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:07,040
so a rational thing to do

1291
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:08,450
to endure life

1292
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:12,060
a couple of different places

1293
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:20,860
good job brass

1294
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:26,190
well let x axis represents time

1295
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:37,170
the y axis represents how good or bad your life is at that time

1296
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:41,360
for those of us who are fans of the neutral container theory the thing to

1297
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:47,170
say is this represents the overall goodness of your content or the overall badness content

1298
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:51,780
the higher up the better the contents of the lower down the worst the contents

1299
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:56,240
for those who are fans of the modernist container theory

1300
01:28:56,260 --> 01:29:00,200
this represents the grand balance so it's

1301
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:05,920
contents plus the extra bit you get from being alive but of course if you're

1302
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,430
a fan of the modest container theory that even if the contents are negative the

1303
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:11,640
ground might still be positive

1304
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:15,790
but this represents the overall bottom line

1305
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:20,740
whether you accept the neutral container theory or the models container theory

1306
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:22,620
so here's an example

1307
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:24,380
well i might look like

1308
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,190
going along pretty well

1309
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,900
and then things get worse

1310
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:31,340
o thing sort of deteriorate

1311
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:33,310
and i suppose

1312
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:40,270
this point represents when you would die of natural causes natural death

1313
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:44,420
so to be and what not as great as it was when you're young and

1314
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:50,860
vigorous and healthy all sorts of opportunities and accomplishments but still until the very end

1315
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:52,410
it stays

1316
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:59,150
well if that's what your life line would look like

1317
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:05,030
pretty clearly suicide doesn't ever make any sense

1318
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:08,460
in particular you wouldn't want to say well look

1319
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:12,160
is the place where i should kill myself because here is where things start to

1320
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:13,730
get worse

1321
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:19,460
yes things are beginning to get worse but they never gets so bad that you're

1322
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:21,230
better off dead

1323
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:27,070
so suicide wouldn't make any sense at all

1324
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:30,540
four suicide makes sense

1325
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:33,780
it's got to be the case that your life

1326
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:35,670
takes a turn for the worse

1327
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:39,630
not just any old turn for the worse but it turns so much for the

1328
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:45,410
that for some chunk of your life

1329
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:51,000
your life is worth the non-existence the zero line the x axis

1330
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:56,710
all right i imagine that what happened here you are healthy and vigorous your accomplishing

1331
01:30:56,710 --> 01:31:01,840
things but you've got some degenerative disease that's going to make things worse and worse

1332
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,900
as the period which is getting worse

1333
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,240
and then

1334
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:09,010
after a while existence is going to be worse than nothing

1335
01:31:09,010 --> 01:31:15,510
here we can at least wrote the question intelligible way might suicide make sense

1336
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:18,460
i suppose this is the point where the downturn begins

1337
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:23,260
should you kill yourself at that stage

1338
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:26,840
because after all even though

1339
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:30,260
the down turn things are getting worse

1340
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:35,440
this going to be another period of life another chunk of whatever it is year

1341
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:40,260
five year six months whatever it is well the like isn't as good

1342
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:42,530
as it had been before

1343
01:31:42,550 --> 01:31:43,690
it's still

1344
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,360
better than nothing

1345
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:52,710
killing yourself at this earlier moment is we might say pre-mature

1346
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:58,070
it's throwing away a chunk of life that would still be worth having

1347
01:31:58,090 --> 01:32:04,860
it's not the right thing to do it doesn't make sense rational

1348
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:07,590
if not that moment what about this moment

1349
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:13,050
here's the precise point at which

1350
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:17,240
your life is becoming worse than nothing

1351
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:21,590
for some initial structure that will be very much worse than nothing but still

1352
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:23,070
the overall

1353
01:32:23,090 --> 01:32:24,710
if the negative

1354
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:29,650
up to that moment your life was worth living from that moment on your life

1355
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:36,420
is worse than nothing if you've got complete control over when to kill yourself

1356
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:40,360
well that would be the time to do it

1357
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,400
suppose you don't have

1358
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:45,820
complete control

1359
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:48,860
it's straightforward enough to say

1360
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,690
if you if you like is going to become

1361
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:56,690
worse than nothing and you have complete control over when you kill yourself

1362
01:32:56,710 --> 01:33:01,130
it seems pretty plausible to say the precise moment which suicide become rational would be

1363
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:05,070
exactly that moment which you life became

1364
01:33:05,090 --> 01:33:06,820
not worth having

1365
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:12,840
but you might not have that kind of control

1366
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:17,280
suppose that what you've got is a degenerative disease that is going to

1367
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:20,490
progressively strip you of the ability

1368
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:23,550
to control your body

1369
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:25,570
fast maybe don't notice or the plateau

1370
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:30,030
and you might use better optimization methods i mentioned

1371
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:35,310
some of them like adam i'm using better smarter you know learning

1372
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:38,240
rate schedules and things like this and we've got it i think a bit

1373
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:43,470
better at that also and it's the second hypothesis some of the

1374
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:47,040
solution to talk about is unsupervised learning for initializing

1375
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:50,430
weights which as we'll see his seems to provide a regularization

1376
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:55,520
effect and of dropout training and also talk about briefly batch

1377
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,270
normalization which is not a method

1378
01:33:57,270 --> 01:34:02,820
which sits kind of at least one another's seems to be sometimes really

1379
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:05,590
helpful in terms of the optimization but also seems to have

1380
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:07,760
a regular zation effect so actually these

1381
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,300
two problems should necessarily think of them as

1382
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:13,920
mutually exclusive yes

1383
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:47,100
i mean yeah there's definitely evidence the question is when using

1384
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,850
batch norm which are yet to describe but i'll get to

1385
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:54,050
there's you know it some people reported that

1386
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:56,470
you don't this need dropout of this point

1387
01:34:56,470 --> 01:35:00,940
which are cover a huge hits to but and that

1388
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,720
that is seems to be consistent across people's experiences i believe

1389
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:11,030
so yeah ok so say when situation we feel

1390
01:35:11,350 --> 01:35:16,850
queer are overfitting then we need a way of somehow constraining

1391
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:19,450
the effective capacity of our model

1392
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:23,020
and one way of doing ing this is actually have are hidden layers

1393
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:26,770
to do something more than just discrimination something more than

1394
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:31,340
just classifying the data and what option to be to have to do a

1395
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:32,870
form of unsupervised learning

1396
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:36,330
where broadly speaking what we mean by that this kind of understanding

1397
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:39,840
the structure the of the inputs not even the relationship with the

1398
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:44,120
label so that is for instance have a form of network that is able

1399
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:46,510
within its hidden layer to capture that

1400
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:49,780
if i'm doing and to character recognition classification

1401
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:53,460
that this is an image of a character and that's random image

1402
01:35:53,470 --> 01:35:57,340
so this is a valid sample from say my distribution if i'm performing

1403
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:01,010
character classification and this is a valid member of my input

1404
01:36:01,020 --> 01:36:06,550
distribution so here i'm going to so the idea is to try to incurs

1405
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:09,140
hidden layers to capture some of that information

1406
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:13,810
and so what's interesting about this is that

1407
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:17,180
this is this is clearly harder task unsupervised learning

1408
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:21,720
which means that the asking for something more of your model and

1409
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:25,000
thus the effective capacity should be reduced so that will fight

1410
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,440
against or fitting and is an extent to which the part of doing

1411
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:33,000
unsupervised learning should be a form of classification if they

1412
01:36:33,010 --> 01:36:34,780
are separate classes in your data

1413
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:38,960
well learning about the input distribution should involve somewhere

1414
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:42,590
representing the fat that there are multiple classes in your data

1415
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:44,760
so this potentially not entirely

1416
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,850
i'm going against the ultimate goal of doing supervised classification

1417
01:36:50,910 --> 01:36:54,350
so one form of unsupervised learning what to do i'm i'm i'm going

1418
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:57,260
to come you know talk about a very simple form is to

1419
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:00,650
use autoencoders so don't quarter's r just feedforward neural

1420
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:03,420
networks where you feed them as input well the input

1421
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:07,510
and you compute the hidden layer lies we do their transformation

1422
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:10,520
on the activation and we try to reproduce

1423
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:14,680
the input so we do another non linear transformation

1424
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:18,100
and maybe some non linear activation function at the output

1425
01:37:18,110 --> 01:37:22,610
layer and then the objective we're going to optimize is the difference

1426
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:26,550
between or some distance between x at the reconstruction produced

1427
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,250
by my doing quarter and my input x

1428
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:35,420
and so i'm going to say whole lot about autoencoders for lack of

1429
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:38,080
time but clearly dis is a form of unsupervised learning

1430
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:41,250
in the sense that there's no label information being use for

1431
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:45,240
performing this training if the number of hidden units

1432
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:48,710
in the hidden layer smaller than the input you can think but

1433
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:53,550
as doing a form of compression of the input which might require

1434
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:57,660
essentially extracting what characterizes my input distribution

1435
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:01,140
specifically compared to just random inputs

1436
01:38:01,370 --> 01:38:05,230
so this is why you might expect extracting some interesting information

1437
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:09,090
about the input distribution over this will quick

1438
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:15,920
and then the the idea here would be to essentially use my unsupervised

1439
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:19,020
learning algorithms so my training milestone quarter which

1440
01:38:19,030 --> 01:38:23,580
trains a single hidden layer in a greedy layer-wise faction as one

1441
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:26,650
approach in ways of doing this so what i would do is first

1442
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:30,310
train my first hidden layer by having this hidden layer reconstruct

1443
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:33,900
the input doing this for a number of steps than that number

1444
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:37,550
of steps is actually going to be hyperparameter my complete procedure

1445
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:42,450
and then at one point i stop i fix the first hidden layer and then

1446
01:38:42,450 --> 01:38:45,680
maybe i add the second hidden layer and that hidden layer could

1447
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:50,000
be used to train on the first hidden layers representation of my

1448
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:53,960
data so i'm trying to extract iraq a second layer representation

1449
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:56,970
of my first layer representation of the data

1450
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:59,950
and can continue like this one layer at a time

1451
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:02,280
for the number of layers i would like to use

1452
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:05,920
in neural net so effectively can see that this is if

1453
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:09,720
effectively trying to learn features the features of features

1454
01:39:09,830 --> 01:39:11,170
but in unsupervised way

1455
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,950
so you do this gives you initial value for all the weights

1456
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,980
of my neural net at all hidden layers

1457
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:24,780
then you add some random weights connecting the last hidden

1458
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:28,050
layer with the output and then you do when we often referred to

1459
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:31,220
as fine-tuning which is just a regular backpropagation

1460
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:34,760
so really you just use this to casgrain descent procedure are described

1461
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:38,670
so far the only thing that this change is how initial i didn't initialize

1462
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,780
the parameters before i start doing

1463
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:43,960
great in descent on my supervised negative log-likelihood

1464
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:53,020
loss yes so the point quarter dimension is is one

1465
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:54,510
let me turn the volume down here

1466
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:59,230
so this is inverse kinematics and the idea is you got manual constraining them to

1467
01:39:59,230 --> 01:40:02,820
be on a skeleton and if you just pull on him okay it just looks

1468
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:03,790
like an artist stole

1469
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:06,900
because it's on the under-constrained what natural set motions is

1470
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:09,080
but this is a high dimensional data set

1471
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:16,300
um ants what they do is they learn that feel them so that's the latent space for basketball players

1472
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:18,300
and just playing the latent space

1473
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:25,620
what they do is they sort of decide to constrain where you see the white dots they've constraint

1474
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:30,970
the figure and then moving the hand around and everything else moves in the most

1475
01:40:30,970 --> 01:40:32,730
likely position so it's like a missing

1476
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:34,120
variable problem

1477
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:36,710
so you've got a joint density over everything

1478
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,270
going to maximize with respect to the latent point you can then try and fill

1479
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:44,490
in the rest of the data the most impressive example i think they have about

1480
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:46,160
is this walking person

1481
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:51,250
so this is this a graph paper some years ago two thousand seven so

1482
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:53,230
this is a model someone walking

1483
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:55,180
and where you see the whites

1484
01:40:56,090 --> 01:40:58,640
they've got constraints always gonna walk in a moment

1485
01:40:58,870 --> 01:40:59,740
they'll play those

1486
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:02,910
okay so now is i think is moving around the latent space

1487
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:04,440
giving you the walk

1488
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:10,580
now they providing white is constraints so they can take off and on and you can say

1489
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:14,580
remove the are and do what's natural constraints on the on this day was most

1490
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:17,310
natural on the model and you can see the arm moves quite nicely

1491
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,060
and then morosely upper-body

1492
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:24,070
i am

1493
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:29,630
does the same thing his legs please give me the most natural upper body

1494
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,950
and then you removed everything apart from the feet

1495
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,970
and says giving what's most natural with the of body

1496
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,000
it's quite nice it's all being done just by

1497
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:44,560
joint model

1498
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:47,260
over these things they've got some other examples in there

1499
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,190
andy uh

1500
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:54,620
i want to show you what i think some of the movies

1501
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:02,240
well i'm so annoyed about outdoor and one

1502
01:42:04,270 --> 01:42:06,800
so this is recent stuff from a

1503
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:12,360
i'm not very good pronounce his surname free occurring

1504
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:14,230
hand in reach

1505
01:42:15,290 --> 01:42:19,920
it's been published in these years it actually i did some work well let me show you one

1506
01:42:20,790 --> 01:42:22,260
maybe this i see this first

1507
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:25,630
this is our attempt it as non vision people

1508
01:42:26,150 --> 01:42:27,280
with my student collec

1509
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:31,510
so this is there trying to infer pose from

1510
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:33,590
from may um

1511
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:40,710
using models we build joint models over pose and silhouette and then we present the

1512
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,020
silhouette and ask for the post

1513
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:47,820
actually it turns out just over

1514
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:49,740
so the again

1515
01:42:50,450 --> 01:42:54,000
this is actually very innovative and this isn't quite executive helium

1516
01:42:54,770 --> 01:42:56,800
this is our prediction the ground truth

1517
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:58,110
so is there

1518
01:42:58,830 --> 01:43:00,680
and that's our prediction from above ground truth

1519
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:02,780
i do not if you do

1520
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:04,070
motion capture

1521
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,980
do not got one sided figure

1522
01:43:08,490 --> 01:43:11,440
thank you side the figure straight i want you to watch the figure

1523
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:14,210
is what's set figure what what's the ground truth

1524
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:17,380
and you see that something bizarre at some point

1525
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:20,560
it since the turn around what we opposite direction

1526
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:24,120
you see there

1527
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:26,880
why did happen

1528
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:28,630
that's the ground truth

1529
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:30,140
what happened

1530
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:35,830
it's vision problem because if you don't want side when the leg disappears

1531
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:41,980
it's horrible and you don't even notice it when the when you get it selects crossover if the two dots

1532
01:43:42,690 --> 01:43:43,670
riverside the leg

1533
01:43:44,730 --> 01:43:47,000
even if that's so if the two dots on this leg

1534
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,210
smart the web

1535
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:50,000
that's that's

1536
01:43:50,030 --> 01:43:51,970
that's that sense and so on

1537
01:43:51,970 --> 01:43:56,170
and wordnet is a big semantic network

1538
01:43:56,300 --> 01:44:00,460
where various relations are established between the different senses

1539
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,380
we see some examples here

1540
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:05,130
you can have that this is similar to this

1541
01:44:05,130 --> 01:44:12,880
derivational related four billion c and brilliance and member of the set and what's not

1542
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:17,570
shown here but i have an example later is you also have a parent-child concepts

1543
01:44:17,570 --> 01:44:20,840
hypernyms and hyponyms

1544
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:25,460
i think it's of continue pointing outwards here this is called the gloss

1545
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:27,800
of surpassing excellence

1546
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:30,110
and that's just provided

1547
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:33,170
so whoever is used

1548
01:44:33,230 --> 01:44:37,010
it's not actually that this is just a glass to help you see what it

1549
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:41,260
is this is actually the definition of what the senses the set the synsets

1550
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,780
and also

1551
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,510
examples are given

1552
01:44:48,150 --> 01:44:49,260
but you see

1553
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:54,820
that really seems like a very subjective word is brilliant brainy

1554
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:55,710
is wonderful

1555
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:57,780
but it has

1556
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,940
sensors that are not not subjective

1557
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,230
so brilliant a bright shining lie

1558
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:07,240
like a brilliant star meaning it's great to ice about perception

1559
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:11,280
or a brilliant brim rights and the trumpet section

1560
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:17,710
a bright sound of the trumpets trumpets are bright sounding cellos are not

1561
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:24,190
so for example method for identifying brilliant material pay us pattern and opening section in

1562
01:45:24,190 --> 01:45:28,130
the minor mode features are brilliant and the melody and then maybe maybe you could

1563
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:32,710
say mellow don't probably no it's not the case where there a mellow telo

1564
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:34,190
part attack

1565
01:45:34,230 --> 01:45:36,320
so words

1566
01:45:36,340 --> 01:45:39,730
often have mixtures of subjective and objective senses

1567
01:45:39,730 --> 01:45:43,360
so let's think about

1568
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:45,260
how we might assign

1569
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,230
can we assign

1570
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:51,090
subjectivity labels to word senses and what might that means

1571
01:45:53,530 --> 01:45:57,190
we want to say there are subjective and objective you can go further broken down

1572
01:45:57,190 --> 01:46:00,630
by positive negative or neutral balls

1573
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:07,550
well again i think you'd have potential disambiguation both ways and we've done some experiments

1574
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:13,920
well if you if you had these links then if you had sensitivity analysis of

1575
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:19,010
the context that might suggest that sense is more likely to be subjective or if

1576
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:19,860
you knew

1577
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:23,980
the sense maybe a clear case which sensitive that can help you tell you tell

1578
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,500
tell you whether

1579
01:46:26,510 --> 01:46:28,340
whether the

1580
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:31,510
the because the context is subjective

1581
01:46:31,530 --> 01:46:36,480
we've so far we have our group has just one direction where we use the

1582
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:41,590
data the analysis to improve word sense disambiguation and this other groups working on this

1583
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:43,320
as well

1584
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:46,420
so think about what we mean

1585
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:50,340
so here are some examples

1586
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:54,690
i'm showing here that this is a hyperlink a hypernym

1587
01:46:54,730 --> 01:47:01,300
concept this is the parent concept so this alarm dismay consternation obviously that's objective in

1588
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:04,190
the sense that it's referring to an emotion

1589
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:09,130
and that's the type of fear fearlessness fry according to work

1590
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:13,800
and that's subjective and if you're adding polarity tags that would be negative OK out

1591
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:19,300
of all things equal if you expect

1592
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:24,800
you expect that would be negative rather than positive whereas alarm warning device along device

1593
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:29,070
that's just the device itself and its objective

1594
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:32,210
so what is the subjective sense

1595
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:36,010
i look dictionary stuff about

1596
01:47:36,010 --> 01:47:38,920
prior expectations

1597
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:44,170
expectations you have without any evidence from the context so that's how i view lexicons

1598
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:46,190
for my purposes

1599
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:50,440
other people looking for different purposes so in a sense of you have attacked so

1600
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:56,110
you say you it's being used with that sense of alarm fearless fears fearfulness you're

1601
01:47:56,110 --> 01:47:58,380
expected to express subjectivity

1602
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:04,760
OK and you also express expect the phrase or sentence containing it to be subjective

1603
01:48:04,780 --> 01:48:05,960
well that seems

1604
01:48:07,570 --> 01:48:10,340
but i'm going to look at a couple examples of then we have to look

1605
01:48:10,340 --> 01:48:12,190
at the objective case

1606
01:48:13,090 --> 01:48:18,880
we already set his alarm grew he was boiling with anger is another example

1607
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,800
let's look at what's the catch

1608
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:27,730
OK and the point i mean if you if you see if you see cat

1609
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,400
with this and you have to read the subject

1610
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:34,710
similar with the doctors o'clock

1611
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:42,400
as a an untrained person knows the untrained person is not this is not subjective

1612
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:45,940
if you say he's aquatic has negative evaluation

1613
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:47,760
by its nature

1614
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:51,400
well let's think about objective sense now

1615
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:55,010
the alarm went off the water boiled

1616
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:57,940
he saw the statue of the market

1617
01:48:58,030 --> 01:49:00,440
the doctors quack was loud increase

1618
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:04,740
these are from wordnet

1619
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,110
so the problem is

1620
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:13,460
you don't necessarily expect phrases or sentences that contain objective sensors

1621
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:15,210
to be objective

1622
01:49:15,230 --> 01:49:21,480
considering what someone said that dunlop off to even boil water it is a very

1623
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:30,110
even though alarm and boyle are used here with their object with objective sensors

1624
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:33,030
so these are subjective but not due to

1625
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:37,860
the senses of alignment boyle in these passages

1626
01:49:38,710 --> 01:49:43,710
when the senses here's our definition when the sensors used text conversations

1627
01:49:43,730 --> 01:49:48,960
we don't expect it to express subjectivity and if the phrase or sentence containing is

1628
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:52,590
subjective this subjectivity is due to something else

1629
01:49:52,630 --> 01:49:56,050
not to that sense

1630
01:49:56,070 --> 01:50:01,780
i have pretty much in parallel with this there's another group that's been annotating wordnet

1631
01:50:02,730 --> 01:50:07,010
so at all used they

1632
01:50:07,030 --> 01:50:10,590
annotated senses of words from the general inquiry guesses my

1633
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:12,240
slides got

1634
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,690
ended up being ordered i have mentioned this before

1635
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:20,070
so the general inquiry lexicon was published in the nineties and it's a little it

1636
01:50:20,070 --> 01:50:25,050
has word list of positive negative and neutral this and several groups use it and

1637
01:50:25,050 --> 01:50:27,000
it's part of our clique

1638
01:50:27,050 --> 01:50:30,730
it's a filtered version of it is part of a subjectivity lexicon that we have

1639
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:34,310
a way to make sure mention and if you go to the web page and

1640
01:50:34,310 --> 01:50:40,070
you download our corpus part and our opinionfinder system part of that is our subjectivity

1641
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:41,840
that second so anybody
