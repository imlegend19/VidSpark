1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,690
looking forward

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,950
at the same time the important to this twenty four hour CNN effect

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,880
the first gulf war was the first war which was covered real time by by

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,020
and this change the way everything works

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,860
the internet itself then then the internet the growth of news reporting on the internet

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,210
during the nine eleven terrorist attacks a lot of people were looking at the

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,430
the the

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,870
the the internet sites

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,850
because they couldn't get through

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,010
the internet sites actually crash because there was so everyone went there to find what

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,980
was what was actually happening

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,740
so we've got this

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,610
twenty four hour rapid information floating around the world

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,640
and there's no sort of growing group of

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,370
the companies researchers are working in this area which is called you open source of

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,580
open source intelligence

17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,810
and we in europe we're not all these years and for

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,840
just after the end of last year

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,110
which brings together

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,250
government agencies plus

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,680
companies and researchers

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,290
and then the ISI conferences and

23
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,060
the tripoli conferences for intelligence in formatting

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,610
have been running since two thousand four

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,260
and there's even an editor handbook on an open source intelligence

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,590
which i

27
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,490
and they need to themselves run training courses

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,200
on open source for for

29
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,500
for this task

30
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,190
OK so what is it

31
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:44,280
open source information is the is the key thing is is is basically data publicly

32
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,430
it doesn't have to be the internet it doesn't have to be

33
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,040
it needs to be publicly available

34
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,660
so it could be

35
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,290
it could be a subscription service as well

36
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,130
but it's something that any member of the public to get hold of

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:09,080
open source intelligence then is proprietary intelligence recursively derived from open source information

38
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,180
intelligence means an interpretation of the data

39
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,150
collecting open source information which is what

40
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,760
the tools what the list let's say the data retrieval aspect of it

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,560
is to select the true the right information for the applications for the the need

42
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,630
the tagging cataloging visualising

43
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,060
i mean normally open source intelligence is the result of an expert who

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,540
analyzes the data prepared by collection by researchers you like

45
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,820
three areas of intelligence

46
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:56,190
information human intelligence signals signal intelligence means phone taps radio intercepts whatever

47
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,220
and so in principle it could also mean email intersect

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,670
and open source intelligence which is getting bigger and bigger

49
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,150
an important

50
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,990
so who uses it

51
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,280
as i said the security services

52
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,110
police law enforcement agencies more and more

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,060
getting involved

54
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,680
normal government organisations they

55
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,710
having need to be kept up-to-date date informed of what's going on that's why we

56
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,960
believe in and we both for the european commission because they they need to know

57
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:39,670
immediately when there's some critical report about some commissioner or when the

58
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,290
what if there is some

59
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,360
crisis brewing they want to know immediately

60
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,890
then the situation centre the a lot of organisations and for a

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,550
african union this is they have a situation centre and they're very interesting using our

62
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:01,240
software basically to keep them informed about developments news reports in africa

63
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,560
then the unit the united nations in

64
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,240
in new york got

65
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,810
twenty four unmanned

66
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,170
crisis room which is continuous in motoring news reports news wires coming in

67
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,840
the world health organization we can hear later about metastasis which is a let's a

68
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,350
medical intelligence system trying to pick up the first reports about disease outbreaks

69
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,570
NGO's and relief agencies they need to know

70
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,120
when there's an earthquake they want to be prepared for so this can growing need

71
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,110
for live information

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,690
targeted information to be brought to the right people

73
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,370
and large companies the big business

74
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,440
if you oil companies they

75
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,310
all of them have a team

76
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,820
o twenty up sometimes up to twenty people who are continuously monitoring

77
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,620
what's happening in

78
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,840
wherever they have oil rigs where they have

79
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,940
where they have their main offices but also

80
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,600
they want to look at what the competition is happening

81
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,060
they need to be kept continuously up today

82
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,690
and this is normally the report straight to the board so the writing daily reports

83
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,480
multinational companies the same thing

84
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,070
and then business intelligence things that can affect stock prices

85
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,150
so what is this thing intelligence it's is just the work but

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,890
in reality

87
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,200
intelligence is always

88
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,040
a report some sort

89
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,670
it could be classified but it's a report

90
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,490
now that is derived from the information is collected and the tools that help them

91
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,050
can make that life easier and it can handle more information

92
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,580
the point is is not just a text report it's just like i was just

93
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,320
as important as the math

94
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,600
or image imagery or data

95
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,180
and of course intelligence

96
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,210
it will be

97
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,010
from classified and open source information

98
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,310
the big advantage of open source

99
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,370
intelligence is that

100
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,610
you can share with other people

101
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,900
because it's not

102
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,090
and this is a big boon for inter-agency collaboration so if your

103
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,550
the police force in the UK

104
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,640
you can share this information with the french police force because it's not

105
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,860
classified or let's say the security services so one one other parts of the open

106
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,320
source intelligence is that you can actually share with other people

107
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,670
is this this closed down

108
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,390
i need to know doesn't really apply

109
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,430
although of course the report might end up being classified even if only depend on

110
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,640
on open source information that's not problem

111
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,210
a typical agency

112
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,890
or company

113
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,440
what do they do

114
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:57,810
so they have they have standard open source product

115
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,230
the first thing is

116
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,970
something happens and everyone in the company or everyone

117
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,570
who needs to know

118
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,640
should be informed by

119
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:13,200
email or SMS messages so we have for example system in in brussels which does

120
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,190
this so there's someone there

121
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,540
the checking the news wires as they come in it's not being updated like if

122
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,660
there's something

123
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,830
particularly in crime important for commission

124
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,730
all or

125
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,040
something that affects the commission in some way

126
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,400
then they send an SMS message immediately

127
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,160
newsflash so that's the sort of standard thing which have which companies and which

128
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,840
organisations have

129
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,360
it's always the case it and the daily briefing so there's a standard product which

130
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,890
is like a daily update on what's happening on what you're interested if you work

131
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,170
for the pharmaceutical industry this would be like saying daily updates on

132
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,640
the miracle of this method is happens to be

133
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,980
it turns out to be very good the average case

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,040
the worst case the algorithm the for the worst case also good the average case

135
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,230
why that's the case we don't know

136
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,620
we were just we just very lucky

137
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,080
so what

138
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,580
we did

139
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,730
you can find

140
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,690
what we did so far is sort of linear models

141
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,730
inputs linear weight vector

142
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,210
w dot x

143
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,190
and in our transfer function as a linear function in other words we didn't do

144
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,890
anything linear regression but now let's put in the transfer function thinking on networks

145
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,480
the sigmoid function

146
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,890
c h i transferred the dot product

147
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,580
into something else i turn the dot product which has range

148
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,420
are into of probability between plus and minus one

149
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,330
when i started teaching on networks

150
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,560
i saw that people were doing this and actually what they used as a loss

151
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,540
function very often the square loss

152
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,210
there should be references aren't you

153
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,520
which drove me crazy

154
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,850
it because it turns out that if you take a bunch of instances and you

155
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,870
look at the total square loss as a function of w

156
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,370
you can have exponentially many many many my space picture of this

157
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,080
wrote a paper on

158
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,460
with peter auer and

159
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,850
you can pick your examples

160
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:47,480
such that you have exponentially many minimizes log scale so it's very unusual example admitted

161
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,410
it but it happens

162
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,750
it means that somehow

163
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,670
when you have this kind of transfer function and taking this kind of loss

164
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,270
this is the thing to do

165
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,540
so what you should do

166
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,250
take the loss function

167
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,000
intuitively that matches

168
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,670
the transfer function

169
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,150
this is how actually i discovered bregman divergences

170
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,150
what happens is

171
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,750
if you draw the sigmoid

172
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,520
and then you take these kind of areas underneath the sigmoid

173
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,690
it turns out that they become relative entropy is

174
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,830
and i

175
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,040
notice this once and i

176
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,650
i had on the page and i

177
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:47,960
kept it around one ran into and eventually generosity bregman divergences and started all of

178
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,500
so let me show you in a moment

179
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,730
this integral here underneath

180
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,910
what you can write this way

181
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,810
has sort of these brakeman side form

182
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,870
if you integrate this out you get a capital h

183
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,420
corresponding to the integrand of the

184
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,190
the potential function of of little age

185
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,080
w that x minus again h of this minus this kind of linear term and

186
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,980
it looks

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,640
it's a bregman divergence well i

188
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,920
it's just a bunch of other things that happened as well because you're

189
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,440
two arguments one is the dot product and the other one is the h one

190
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,370
is one of the label but this

191
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,270
happens to be a bregman divergence

192
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,670
this is how i discovered that if you take this kind of loss

193
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,250
the bad thing to do is

194
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,890
you know what the transfer function is it takes some kind of other loss

195
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,230
but if you take the areas that underneath this your loss

196
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,190
which would you call which we call the matching loss

197
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,750
there's only one minimum

198
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,790
and it's not convex

199
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:13,230
so let me give you an example given is some some examples of these things

200
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,210
so we want to use

201
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,000
this loss

202
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:22,440
so loss of the instance because the match the matching is convex in your parameter

203
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,020
what is this well typical things if you transfer function is the straight line

204
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,460
then you can

205
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,270
this kind of

206
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,520
convex function and the square loss is the natural off

207
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,410
if you take the sigmoid function

208
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,920
then this is your convex function it looks like

209
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,690
the sigmoid function looks like this this is a convex function

210
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,600
and the corresponding loss is the logistic loss

211
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,730
if you take the sign

212
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,420
which is

213
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,850
this kind of transfer function is an increasing function

214
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,640
the corresponding h is this function itself

215
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,020
paint function

216
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:12,100
the corresponding loss is the hinge loss

217
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,890
OK so let me go a little bit more

218
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,120
on what happened with the update is

219
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,640
if you take the gradient of this

220
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,370
matching loss

221
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,350
remember in our data will always have the gradient of loss

222
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,920
that is very simple form now

223
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,440
has this form

224
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,350
so now

225
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,940
the update

226
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,750
kind of the

227
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,150
the frequent updates

228
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,560
it also

229
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,230
the gradient has this very simple form

230
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,520
kate has his age function and so this is the sort of and generalisation

231
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,640
this kind of the delta rule this can be

232
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:05,440
exploded now approves

233
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,750
again let's talk a little bit about

234
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:15,350
sigmoid transfer function if you have a slow parameter making steeper and steeper eventually becomes

235
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,920
the sign

236
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,520
and if you take the sign the new convex function becomes this and the matching

237
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,750
loss becomes this kind of hinge loss

238
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,790
it's zero here on the right side but increases on the wrong side

239
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:36,920
it's convex but not differentiable anymore in the limit

240
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,460
so why is this interesting well if you take gradient descent and use on the

241
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,500
loss side the hinge loss

242
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,750
then you end up the perceptron algorithm

243
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,500
which was one of the simplest algorithm first applied to learn

244
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,290
to learn in this tutorial i applied to learning

245
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,000
if you take

246
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:07,190
the exponentiated gradient algorithm with the hinge loss up with the winner out of the

247
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,650
i can motivate

248
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,910
all of these algorithms using these frameworks

249
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,150
in the case of normalized winnow i took of my parameter divergence my divergence that

250
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,710
motivates the updates the relative entropy and as the

251
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,350
as the loss function also one of those in tropical motivated what i took as

252
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,560
the loss function the one that corresponds to the

253
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,190
link function the function being the sine function then i end up with the hinge

254
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,870
loss and the combined thing gives me

255
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,760
embodied by this

256
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,550
code here is comparable to what you are expected to adhere to in your professional

257
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,660
they don't publish

258
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,560
results that you faked

259
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,790
you know publish results that you stole from others and represented as your own

260
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,130
so don't start here

261
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,500
and you know

262
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,590
it happens infrequently but i've got to tell you a few years back on the

263
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,230
final exam

264
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,370
a couple people

265
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,770
we're involved in passing information back and forth they got caught you know why they

266
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,120
got caught because for the first time you're being taught by people who are smart

267
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,970
as you are

268
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,100
so you're going to get caught my TA's are really smart

269
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,470
so i don't think it's like back in

270
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,000
place i could find somebody who it's not like we're back in

271
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,910
the whole country has that that's right

272
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,030
so don't try to

273
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,560
going to get cut these guys got caught i had to press the case the

274
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,240
committee on discipline

275
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,030
one of them did not return for his sophomore year

276
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,570
that's the crazy thing to do

277
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,500
huge price to pay

278
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,510
in the past no record first semester class

279
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,540
you know its most severe on the committee on this what it's made of faculty

280
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,630
administrators and students and guests with the most severe members of that committee are

281
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:11,470
it's the students your peers who are outraged that kind of behavior

282
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,160
springer behaves

283
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:19,320
i have to maintain for learning environment here we've got round numbers in excess of

284
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,020
four hundred people sitting here

285
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,890
so i expect certain things here

286
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,990
that's not going to go on

287
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,320
first of all

288
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,050
no conversations no talk

289
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,460
the conversation here conversation their heads

290
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,020
so i insist

291
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,540
no talking

292
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,900
please no food or drink

293
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,100
no food or drink works were ceded sheet to gel here somebody opening up the

294
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,740
clamshell with some hot food and it's not right

295
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:52,370
right places all kinds of trash left around nobody picks up stuff now this is

296
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:56,290
an exception this is

297
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,000
for medicinal purposes

298
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,000
it can make sure that my throat doesn't get dry

299
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,790
and i swear it really contains frescoes

300
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,860
and of course no disruptive behavior

301
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:16,630
no disruptive behavior are wireless communications devices must be silenced

302
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,770
OK so

303
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,340
from this moment for

304
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,650
there's some stuff will offer earlier but i let it slide because i haven't had

305
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:26,820
much chance to explain what my expectations but from this moment forward

306
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,480
cell phone goes off

307
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,300
leave the role

308
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,960
lord help the cell phone goes after an exam

309
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,700
because those things have text messaging capabilities

310
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,050
if your cell phone goes after exam

311
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,270
i come up there

312
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,050
grab paper by terence happen i give you zero

313
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,600
i am teach teaching professional behavior it's unprofessional

314
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,010
you can say that i

315
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,570
over the top on this

316
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,550
i got four hundred fifty people here

317
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,350
i want to maintain for learning environment you walk through that door it's an act

318
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,330
of free will

319
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,950
so that the free will

320
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,120
somebody's leaving

321
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:15,010
the school is getting get started right now please

322
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,740
it makes life insurance

323
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,950
you all these gals dinner i tell you

324
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,640
all right turn off

325
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,100
they have to make noises you term after my but that's it

326
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,430
when you walk through that door

327
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,560
it's an act of free will

328
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,510
and we enter into a contract

329
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,470
you walk in here you have certain expectations

330
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,700
you expect me

331
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,970
to conduct myself professionally

332
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,580
expect me to respect you expect me not to use foul language expect me not

333
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,700
to say

334
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,410
offensive things to you

335
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,620
expect well-prepared lecture

336
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,260
you know what i have expectations of you

337
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:06,370
i expect you to come to class prepared i expect you to sit there quietly

338
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,970
respect your neighbors

339
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,100
i expect you to contribute to the learning environment

340
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,990
that's the reason

341
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,930
course will tell you what this is

342
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,680
this is a listing for three online one

343
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,430
five zero seven

344
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,350
five zero seven five hours is contact

345
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:37,560
three hours here two hours recitation structures zero there's no lab seven one seven

346
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,120
that must be the time you spend

347
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,720
to proceed well applied let's look at the total

348
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,480
amortized costs

349
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,470
of an operation

350
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,980
that's just

351
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,120
the sum

352
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:01,100
i called one and c so i had

353
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,220
that's the total amortized cost

354
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,330
and that's equal to

355
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,060
by substitution

356
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,600
just to see i had for this formula

357
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,870
that's the i

358
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,850
was the

359
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:26,720
the i minus e

360
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,160
the i minus one

361
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,750
that's cool too

362
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:41,970
see i

363
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:49,620
and now what happens by some of these terms

364
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,370
what happens rise some of these are what's the mathematical

365
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:57,120
the term we use for

366
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,560
OK every term on the left

367
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,700
is an indian once one if xi

368
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,350
and subtracted it out when it's

369
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,870
i minus one

370
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,080
except for the first and last terms

371
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,390
the term for an

372
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,330
is only added

373
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:24,000
and the term for zero is always attracted out

374
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:34,250
cases because it telescopes

375
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:40,310
OK so this term is what

376
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,390
property we know this

377
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,600
gradient equal to zero

378
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,520
and this one

379
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,520
because there

380
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,910
so therefore

381
00:22:51,930 --> 00:23:03,480
this is greater than equal to c i

382
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,500
and that's

383
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,890
we ties costs

384
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,220
are an upper bound on the true cross

385
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,750
is what we want some of the advertised cost is an upper bound on some

386
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,140
of the true cross

387
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,240
but here the way that we define the amortized costs

388
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:25,040
it was through by first defining the potential function

389
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,470
OK so the potential function is is sort of as i said the difference between

390
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,220
the accounting and the

391
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:36,080
potential method is to specify the bank account or you specify the cost

392
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:41,520
specify the potential energy at any point for you specify the cost in point

393
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,500
but in any case you get

394
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,240
this panel also this methods

395
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,580
i somewhere

396
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,430
like telescopes

397
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,240
the ties cos upper bound to

398
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,430
leicester table that way

399
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:36,080
so to analyse this we have to define our potential

400
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,870
anybody can get this off the top of their head

401
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,790
they're are better than i am

402
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:48,290
i struggled this with this for probably

403
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,520
easily a couple hours to get it right

404
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,700
OK because i'm not too smart

405
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:03,790
has the potential function to do this

406
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,810
two i minus two to to the

407
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,540
the ceiling of logie

408
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:19,290
that to the ceiling of log zero

409
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:22,740
this called the zero because that's what it is known

410
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,970
so i take

411
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,270
the limit

412
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:31,370
the log zero this becomes minus entities easier

413
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,770
so that's just a mathematical convenience

414
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,600
so that

415
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,160
what i get this from

416
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:48,980
i played around try look at look that sequence i raised my sort of chaos

417
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,020
what's the

418
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,930
reversing there are some problems forced to find a potential function is fairly easy

419
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,080
defining the amortized cost is hard

420
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,000
OK to define counter so for this one here the accounting method is

421
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,270
i would say no easier method use

422
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,640
however show you still can do with potential method if you come up with the

423
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,540
right potential

424
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,290
OK so intuitively

425
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:16,640
this is basically what's left in the bank account at the i th operation

426
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,680
because i've got put into why things into the bank

427
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:25,040
subtracted out this many essentially from table problems

428
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,930
OK up to that point

429
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,720
so first let's observe

430
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:43,220
what is the d zero

431
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,600
that's good

432
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,750
the idea i

433
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,930
it's critical to zero why is that

434
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:19,350
why is that

435
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,270
so what's the biggest

436
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,660
the ceiling wall guy

437
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:30,330
could be

438
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,520
so in of organise either logi

439
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,000
what i

440
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,640
twenty plus one

441
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,290
so the biggest it is this log i plus one it's log plus one

442
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,910
two to the

443
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:49,700
logie plus one

444
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,980
it's just too i

445
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,020
that's the biggest could be

446
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,600
one of my

447
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,620
plus one

448
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,500
it's just

449
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,100
it's just too

450
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,240
this is just

451
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,830
this other ways i tend to

452
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:17,270
OK i for that part two for that port

453
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:20,290
so that's the biggest it could be

454
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,810
o for its

455
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,290
just logo by

456
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,640
so this is going to be too on my side

457
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:31,200
or two i minus

458
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,370
two on

459
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,770
in either case

460
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,560
bigger than zero

461
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,840
selecting t but it doesn't have to be

462
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,370
and finally you can also use the idea of reproducing kernels to come up with

463
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,850
a much more general

464
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:54,800
formulation namely the class of admissible kernels that you can use are functions that are

465
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,230
symmetric in their arguments and the positive definite in the sense that for any collection

466
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:05,570
of n samples this gram matrix k i j is symmetric positive definite

467
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,220
so if you design a k in this fashion

468
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,710
it doesn't have to be either the minus something it's generally going to be valid

469
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,220
and in fact if you designed if you have two

470
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,710
admissible kernels then you can have an enormous number of new constructions by doing things

471
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,940
like a positive linear combination of these two kernels are the product of two kernels

472
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,980
are not any number of different things

473
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,710
so the reason i'm bringing all this up is just to put in perspective the

474
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,900
idea that things like the bilateral filter in the non-local means and so on these

475
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,360
are tiny tiny special cases

476
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,500
of some something very very broad that can be done

477
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:49,510
OK so before going any further let me sort of back off

478
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,820
the the equations a bit and show you some examples

479
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:58,350
we have applied these ideas to a lot of different applications

480
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,810
i'm gonna show you some examples just for denoising for focus stacking

481
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,990
we've also applied it to interpolation and super resolution in the blurring in these two

482
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:11,580
things in fact we've commercialized in a company that we started five years ago which

483
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,350
produces software for doing

484
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:17,000
video enhancement for lots of different applications

485
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:21,830
OK so for denoising let me give you an example so here's a photo of

486
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,090
of JFK

487
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:29,040
this is actually a real thirty five millimeter photo that's been scanned to a digital

488
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:36,480
was certainly the noise in this image is not gaussians is that even uncorrelated

489
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,380
it's in fact the combination of film grain noise and

490
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,780
scanning artifacts and so on

491
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:48,160
so here's the noisy image and here's the denoised version using our algorithm which uses

492
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:52,650
locally adaptive regression kernels let me just go back and forth as you can see

493
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:58,450
the fidelity is very very high you can hardly tell the difference you have to

494
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,870
look at this image for fair amount of time to see the difference and in

495
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,300
fact it's interesting if now you kind of scan the literature and look at the

496
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,220
algorithms that sort of state of the art

497
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,210
so here's the plot shows the mean squared error for that is i could show

498
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,400
you mean squared error causing the images just given to us i don't have the

499
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,650
ground truth but if you do a bunch of monte carlo simulations you can look

500
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,100
at the mean squared error versus the standard deviation of the noise added to the

501
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,020
image and you see is that sort of the top

502
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,500
few algorithms that are out there for

503
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:35,870
denoising are sort of clump together in a very tight band

504
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,590
and we've also done a paper called is denoising dead which came out in few

505
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:47,900
months ago we computed lower bounds kramer lower bounds and what we've noticed is that

506
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,220
all of these algorithms are very tightly bunched but there is still room for improvement

507
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,410
depending on the type of image that you have

508
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:59,050
and also later on was now let's talk in this session

509
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:04,100
well also give another perspective on these ideas as well

510
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:16,340
we actually transfer the image to why CBC are

511
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,250
do it there and then transfer back to our genes

512
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:25,000
well yes so so what you want to do is to be much more careful

513
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,550
about the the luminance channel the chromosome makes

514
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,420
much less difference so we can you can be more aggressive in denoising in the

515
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,460
chroma channels

516
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:40,890
OK so another quick application and this is something that is common problem that's been

517
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,850
around for a long time when you have limited depth of focus one of the

518
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,680
things you can do is take multiple images with different

519
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,890
for links and then combine these images together in these ideas this sort of regression

520
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,140
weighted least squares you talked about doesn't have to be done just for

521
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:02,370
it just in space if you have multiple images can also be done it multiple

522
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,930
times images same time can also be done in time or in any other dimension

523
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:10,420
in this case perhaps the focal so we've also use this these ideas to

524
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,610
combined these images together to get one fully focused image and this is the idea

525
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:19,060
that's been around in microscopy for for a long time with a very simple solution

526
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,450
to the works really well

527
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,240
it's just the extension of so the algorithm i showed you

528
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,160
with the proper weight selection

529
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,850
be energy is the energy of a spin system

530
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,710
some overload

531
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,670
cross has been

532
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,950
and then they will be

533
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,230
local field age and it could be

534
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,840
in and where x

535
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,840
and dimensional binary

536
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,280
that's an example

537
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,070
the problem we might want to solve the sort of thing

538
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,130
you might want know if you're not a magnet

539
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,640
what is it

540
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,830
average energy

541
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:19,460
what these fluctuations in the energy which you get if you know the mean squared energy

542
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:20,620
and the mean energy

543
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,750
what that mean magnetization which is

544
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,660
these or

545
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,910
maybe what i mean squared

546
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,720
about because the entropy

547
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,380
all which is which

548
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,770
is the average of all

549
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,370
love will be

550
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,760
a bunch of things you might want to

551
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:53,050
and magnet and you probably won't want to know although at the range in temperature open

552
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,320
from the beta

553
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,040
like this

554
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,880
local identity

555
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,320
and then got

556
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,680
and what people not depend on

557
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,970
in the temperature data

558
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,410
o inverse temperature

559
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:09,800
so there

560
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,190
example the things might and

561
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,130
am i emphasize last time when we do monte carlo methods we are not trying

562
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:25,220
to find the most probable date of that we're not trying to minimize

563
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:27,860
we would only be

564
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,800
doing at if we set the temperature

565
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:38,160
in the temperature very large value weight is very cold then it will be on land that's not

566
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,810
the goal of the month and we're not quite we're interested in sampling from the all

567
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,830
distribution seeing what a few samples from that what look like

568
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,800
and we're not trying to be all the people affected by the

569
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,380
easily be bigger

570
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,060
than the number

571
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,780
electrons in the universe

572
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,960
raise bring about our

573
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,690
okay so that's the rules of the game and an example of what we're doing

574
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:09,620
and last time we discussed the importance sampling rejection sampling

575
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,400
the sampling and the properties methods

576
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,940
the problem is that it is actually a very general

577
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:22,200
actual because many other methods are examples the problem and that when i say that the property that today

578
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,750
and quite often using it shorthand or

579
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,500
metropolis methods with a simple proposal distribution of the height i showed

580
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:32,750
little show

581
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,400
let's repeat the show now

582
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,610
just to remind you what we're doing

583
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,250
so we have a nasty probability distribution in red

584
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,850
have functions whose average values

585
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,460
during the then

586
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,090
look at simple

587
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,640
sampling from a uniform distribution

588
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,860
and then reweighting points

589
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,050
we look at

590
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,480
sampling from a different distribution

591
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,410
which you could draw samples from shown in

592
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,990
green easy distribution to the new reweight point that

593
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,560
all the importance sampling new reweight

594
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,580
the why values

595
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:16,310
to take account of having used the wrong distribution

596
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,310
and we didn't grow variety of distribution will here

597
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,710
then we look at

598
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,890
rejection sampling which is the way that

599
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,940
sampling from the red distribution by throwing away

600
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:29,980
some of

601
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,720
sample you grew from

602
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,050
the green distribution

603
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,480
and rejection sampling

604
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,040
doesn't work if you do wrong

605
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,130
and what they were doing i dimensions

606
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,160
but it

607
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:47,490
often the bible technique in small numbers government the first one dimension

608
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,880
and there are high dimensional

609
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,600
methods the sampling which a new project to bring the component to make them go

610
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,840
the reject something being used in one dimension

611
00:37:59,330 --> 00:37:59,750
the time

612
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:04,110
so good heuristics for this is to

613
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,590
to be a prime

614
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:13,030
not too close

615
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:17,130
two of power

616
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:22,530
or ten because those are the two common bases that

617
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,230
see regularity in

618
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,920
in the world

619
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,570
prime sometimes inconvenient

620
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,980
but but generally is fairly easy to to find primes and there's a lot of

621
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,860
nice theorems about primes

622
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,770
generally what you do if you're just going up something and you know it is

623
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,550
in the prime out of

624
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,000
no textbook around of

625
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,840
you know looking up on the web or read program whatever

626
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,480
the prime not going to close to paris to attend probably works pretty well

627
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,360
i worked pretty well

628
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,110
so this is a very popular method the division method

629
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,780
but the next method we're going to see is actually usually superior

630
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,510
the reason people do this is because

631
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,170
they can write it

632
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,050
right in line in the code

633
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:19,340
OK but is not usually the best method and the reason is because the vision

634
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,550
one of the reasons is that division

635
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:26,420
tends to take a lot of cycles to compute on most computers compared with

636
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,570
multiplication or division

637
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,880
in fact it's usually

638
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,860
and several applications

639
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,750
so the next method

640
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,500
actually generally better but

641
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,880
none of the hash function that we're talking about today are

642
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,690
or in some sense probably good hash functions

643
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:57,320
so for the multiplication method the nice thing about it is just essentially requires multiplication

644
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,610
to do

645
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,320
for this

646
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,420
we can assume that

647
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,010
number of slots is power of two which is also often very can

648
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:14,730
and for this we assume that the computer

649
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,770
i w

650
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,840
the convenient on a computer with

651
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,550
with thirty two bits

652
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,300
or sixty four bits for example

653
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,190
this is very confusing

654
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,480
so the

655
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,460
this function is the following each OK

656
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,340
is equal to

657
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,340
eight times

658
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,630
two to w

659
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,840
right shifted

660
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,780
i my so

661
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,530
the key part of this is a which is chosen to be in

662
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:04,420
in the range between two to w minus one

663
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,460
and two to the w

664
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,820
so it's an odd integer the full with the computer work

665
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:20,590
what you do is you multiply it by whatever by this

666
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,800
for any integer

667
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,530
and then take it to the w

668
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:31,400
and then you take the result in right shifted by the fixed amount of human

669
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:36,340
so this is a bit wise

670
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:47,610
so let's look at what this does but first let me just give you a

671
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,340
couple of

672
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:53,070
tips on how you pick what you don't take for

673
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,920
for a topic

674
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,860
two close

675
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,170
two power of two

676
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:14,730
and it's generally if pretty fast map

677
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,230
two w

678
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,300
i think the right shift is that

679
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,280
especially because this is known shift

680
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,440
you could you know before you computing the hash function

681
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,900
w and are known to the compiler can often do tricks there

682
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,590
to make it going fast

683
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:51,290
a short latencies and accuracy

684
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:54,480
so and this tutorial on

685
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,690
the can

686
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:03,360
learn more

687
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:09,860
i look like

688
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,020
so it knows

689
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:24,130
this section and so this

690
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:25,060
of my

691
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,040
my course of the last source

692
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,420
i hope i

693
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,080
convinced that machine learning

694
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:37,210
good reasons can be very useful in single trial EEG analysis but

695
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,880
there's also

696
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:46,000
problematic parts and this is the validation of the methods and unfortunately

697
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,710
i can see in many

698
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,670
manuscripts that i submitted to journals and even in

699
00:43:53,690 --> 00:44:00,000
published articles that many many groups are not there are not many who some research

700
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,190
let's not available

701
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,270
problem set

702
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,400
one is to take care of the validation rules that

703
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,170
it's trying to

704
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:13,090
give some some advice to make the problem

705
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,480
validation so the

706
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:21,040
the principle of validating this method is quite

707
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,770
quite obvious so

708
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:28,190
what is machine learning methods to typically require one training data set

709
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:30,790
to tune you all your parameters

710
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:32,900
and the test dataset which

711
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:38,150
then in the real applications the feedback data is

712
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:42,130
you of course don't know in advance what looks like

713
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,420
so it

714
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,560
validation can only be proper if you don't use this test set in any way

715
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,400
determine some some of the parameters

716
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:56,000
and also in the

717
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,770
tests are independent from the same person

718
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,210
training set

719
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,810
this more concrete

720
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,210
problems that male

721
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:13,560
that is the problem then if preprocessing methods use statistics of

722
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,080
o datasets

723
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,580
example so

724
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:21,650
validation typically take one dataset want to validate the message on that

725
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:26,380
and if you first use of the whole dataset to compute some statistics

726
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,540
and pre processing then to the

727
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,440
validation afterwards

728
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,020
so that

729
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:35,960
that's wrong and that that's the problem so for example if you apply

730
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,480
i see a to the whole dataset in the beginning and only do the cross

731
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,190
for for the classifier in the end

732
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:47,670
so then you can use some statistics the test set

733
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:49,860
four preprocessing and what you

734
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,230
should i feel

735
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,920
normalize the future based on

736
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:01,580
samples from the from the test and this is particularly severe problem

737
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:07,170
if the pre processing methods used label information for example the csps i'm showing you

738
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:13,350
if you calculate CSP first on the whole dataset and then to cross validation only

739
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,350
for the classifier part

740
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,790
he was severely underestimated the arrow

741
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:20,860
so in particular we have

742
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:26,590
on several datasets if you do that you would get like zero percent error because

743
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:29,360
it's better if it does some overfitting

744
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,400
and if you do a proper validation

745
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,810
you get a chance

746
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:34,750
so in

747
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,360
so that means either you do

748
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:45,310
this preprocessing within the cross validation which is very time consuming or your

749
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:51,580
don't to cross validation but just data once the training and test sets

750
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,040
so in which is

751
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,500
one is the same so if you do feature selection

752
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,270
on the whole dataset

753
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:04,310
and only validates the classification this also the

754
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,210
completely under-estimating the

755
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:10,440
perform over estimating perform

756
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,690
must be selected only based on the training

757
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,150
then if you

758
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:23,210
if you select some some hyperparameters slide

759
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:27,750
the come offering which if you don't have to automatically but if you select the

760
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,790
also a problem if you do

761
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:34,560
for each common proper cross validation

762
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,350
and then say oh i see

763
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,130
i got my first point two

764
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:42,230
it's the best best value and report this error is you

765
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,830
generalisation performance

766
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,130
so as an

767
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,540
the selection of the game are dependent on the test set for you

768
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,190
to select all these parameters also hyperparameters

769
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,710
based on the training set

770
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,040
another problems

771
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:06,330
artifacts are outliers are removed from the whole dataset then it will cross validation because

772
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:07,790
when you make

773
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:12,750
tests easier so to say so you're also excludes

774
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:16,230
artifacts from from the test

775
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:20,710
so of course you can have a method for on line detection of of artifacts

776
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,110
and reject them

777
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:26,920
but then you need to different performance measures

778
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,520
i hope that these points for

779
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,560
what is clear from

780
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,770
so audience and one point i want to focus on

781
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,210
in the remaining parts

782
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:44,790
and this is an unselfish and validation in

783
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,810
paradigm is blocked is

784
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:53,310
and this is what i mean by that so the task is to discriminate between

785
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:59,290
mental state in two different conditions and core

786
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:01,250
the design of block design

787
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:03,900
periods for which there is no

788
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,790
our generation between

789
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:09,090
two conditions is much longer than

790
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,420
the switching

791
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,480
should be in the

792
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,810
we performance in the online situation

793
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:17,580
so this can be maybe best explained the

794
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,170
so here we have different blocks

795
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:24,580
seven seven blocks in the first block

796
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:29,330
we only have tried according to condition one in the second globally

797
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,540
according to condition two

798
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,690
and so on

799
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:37,250
so this might be that the subject is continuously in one condition and

800
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:39,670
here you're just cut out

801
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,750
smallest thing try

802
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,250
i like this

803
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,250
separated single

804
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,090
so these

805
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:51,460
kind of design so

806
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,360
sometimes use the

807
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,580
condition is one that you can

808
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,980
it's it's more easy to

809
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,860
keep keep up for a long time so for example if you want to

810
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,860
driver BCI this

811
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,750
so a

812
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,770
doing mass or

813
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:16,380
mister thaksin mentally augmented mental arithmetic o composing a letter

814
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,170
the stick

815
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:21,690
and then if you changes i mean what is

816
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,230
is that because

817
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,920
whatever we play we you meet this

818
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:31,020
black circles

819
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,190
you can you can have a look

820
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:36,250
players zero

821
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:40,110
choose its rules so that whatever rules

822
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:42,310
player wants to play

823
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,770
we meet infinitely often

824
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:46,380
black circle

825
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,730
number black's position

826
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:53,270
maybe also squares that are black thing like you

827
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,020
i mean

828
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,520
on the other hand from here

829
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,400
if a one

830
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:02,730
besides two

831
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,840
so when he's here he phrases

832
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:11,480
here we present

833
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,150
whatever plan zero

834
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,670
and that

835
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,420
because he is the way to

836
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:24,070
two this parts where nothing is colored black

837
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,840
so you have an ocean of

838
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,790
winning play

839
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,710
positions were

840
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,900
i have a strategy to apply

841
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,310
i we

842
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:43,320
whatever the other one wonders

843
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:47,750
so what is very is that

844
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:49,770
so that's the

845
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,190
one player sigma law is the other player

846
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:02,040
so i called wlg of sigma the set was

847
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,380
well i have a winning strategy

848
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,790
to win

849
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,650
whatever the other one does

850
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:14,820
so again is that the mind if

851
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,250
like to be in the position

852
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,340
we know that

853
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,440
one of the two

854
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,320
o has a winning strategy so it means that

855
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,590
there's always

856
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,170
from one of them

857
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:32,290
two of the policy

858
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,860
in order to it

859
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,840
we turns for one player

860
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,000
and winning positions

861
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,630
for the other player for

862
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:48,550
in the summer of what i mean by winning what do i have a strategy

863
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:51,250
so that whatever the other one place

864
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:54,460
o winning strategy

865
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,630
and this is really about

866
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,900
you have this was

867
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,380
which tells you that

868
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:06,730
i think in the the mind it means that if i choose initial positions

869
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,090
i the wins

870
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,940
the show

871
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,960
hopefully what sure

872
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:19,770
provided he chooses good strategy and of course but that is can agents can't help

873
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:24,610
with the way to play a role show whatever the place

874
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,070
can be

875
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,170
to his

876
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,340
and something also very important

877
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,770
is that this is an example is given to you here that i wrote

878
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,790
i will honestly this

879
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,540
whatever his story

880
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,460
as long as i might play a

881
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,340
so cut passes the technical condition

882
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:55,940
might replace that by stochastic continuity it's not really very

883
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,090
very relevant for us it's sort of means that we can look at the random

884
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:03,850
function as well as the collection of random variables

885
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,350
so we want right continuous and pass pass with left limits

886
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,650
just to be to be definitive

887
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,840
i haven't said what the state space is well

888
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,100
this definition makes sense in very high generality

889
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:24,280
if you have something like a locally compact topological group then

890
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:29,340
this is a meaningful definition but of course we're going to focus on on real

891
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,780
valued processes and

892
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:37,670
one possible extensions to k dimensional euclidean space they can have two or three dimensional

893
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:43,200
processes you think of financial applications and you may just have lots of assets and

894
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:48,460
you want to study their joint evolution and we can set up levy

895
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:49,770
process models

896
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:53,340
in that space which has the dimensions

897
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,700
as the number of as

898
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:58,650
many examples

899
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:00,410
that you

900
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,010
well i have come across i i suppose is brownian motion

901
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:09,220
well we have normally distributed increments

902
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:14,960
and the pos on process where we have also distributed increments notice that

903
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:20,090
the properties of the stationarity and independence of increments are related to the fact that

904
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,330
we we have in the parameters to be

905
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,220
and linear

906
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:26,460
in t here

907
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:31,100
so i've got two simulations of brownian motion and opossum process

908
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,570
for you to look at here

909
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:39,790
what we can do is is calculated moment generating functions that characterize these distributions is

910
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,200
is something

911
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,460
because very very elementary here

912
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:50,360
nevertheless leads to a form that we are going to see in the more general

913
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,440
case of

914
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,160
of an arbitrary

915
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,440
lady process

916
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:56,550
later on

917
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:06,040
next main example to construct lady processes is going to be the company was sold

918
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:12,000
process component for some browsers is built from a platform process and as we've just

919
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,930
looked at

920
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:19,590
and a number of independent and identically distributed random variables so we sum up

921
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:25,720
have many of them by time t as the plus on process tells us

922
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:30,610
the evolution of this process is then to start from zero

923
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,870
and then make that jump a one

924
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:39,390
then do nothing until the possum processes

925
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:43,970
jumps to two in by which case we add the

926
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,020
random variable eight to twelve

927
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:49,310
process and we get this evolution

928
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,370
so to calculate this moment generating function

929
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:57,590
and we need to do a little bit more work and one way of doing

930
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:58,590
it is to

931
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:02,710
the condition on on the value of NT

932
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,420
if we do this then the random variable that we have

933
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:12,920
looking at is just the sum of n independent identically distributed random variables

934
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:18,700
and the moment generating function of of one of such a sum of random variables

935
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,410
is just the end power

936
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:24,120
of the moment generating function of the random variable

937
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:28,730
and what we're looking at here for our moment generating function of the interested in

938
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,860
an exponential serious

939
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:33,620
that we

940
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,580
can right

941
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,580
as exponential

942
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:39,330
and then we get this

943
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:42,080
this may be slightly strange time of

944
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:46,500
t lambda into expectation e to the gamma a one minus one

945
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,350
well that minus one

946
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,350
and we can actually move that bracket over here

947
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:54,250
because the expectation of one is one

948
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,510
and what we're looking at here

949
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:58,210
is an integral

950
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:02,430
of e to the gamma x minus one

951
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:04,810
integrated against the distribution

952
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:06,510
of the random variable

953
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,690
a one

954
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:11,090
and this is the key observation that will

955
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,210
get back to

956
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:18,470
lady processes are

957
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:24,970
o processors with with some strong properties and one of them is infinite divisibility

958
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:26,590
the definition is that

959
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:29,140
a random variable is infinitely divisible

960
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:34,970
if you can write it as the sum of n independent identically distributed random variables

961
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,260
for all n

962
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:38,630
greater than i equal to two

963
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:41,370
the meaning of this is that the distribution

964
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:44,300
of y j and will depend on n

965
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:45,930
but not on

966
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,670
so such a property you can sort of cut down your random variable and consider

967
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:55,590
it as the sum of smaller pieces

968
00:58:55,590 --> 00:59:01,750
that's the property that all of processes have because if we look at xt

969
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:08,660
we've got that stationarity and independence of increments so we can actually take as y

970
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,160
j n

971
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,350
increments of lag

972
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,220
t over n

973
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:17,240
and if we take the consecutive increments here

974
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:22,670
then summing over these we get telescoping sums which means we are left with the

975
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:28,680
first term for j calls and and the second term for j equals one

976
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,210
and that means we fall back on two

977
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,920
well but we know that these random variables here

978
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:39,190
are identically distributed and independent so

979
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,450
this is showing

980
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:45,190
infinite divisibility of

981
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,580
the processes distributions

982
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,850
OK well this is

983
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:57,670
probably the most technical part of the talk infinite divisibility had been studied

984
00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:02,420
the structural rules which can my afterwards

985
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:05,080
there's something different this rule

986
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,320
then the conjunction

987
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:11,210
tation rule

988
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:12,660
and that is

989
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:14,960
that the action goes on

990
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:17,700
inside of the track

991
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:25,150
something else looking at this matter and have

992
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:27,970
a complicated

993
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,380
or a special

994
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:33,320
variation of the cat world

995
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:56,960
and the rest of cultural much like the cut earlier

996
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:02,070
i realize that you can prove cut

997
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,340
in the system you know

998
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,930
there are induction

999
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:15,350
on the on line procedure need is four line inference derived cut

1000
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:20,570
and here

1001
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:24,150
also give us a little bit practice

1002
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:26,770
doing the mission

1003
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,090
so what we want

1004
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:39,230
what we want is we want

1005
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:42,360
x turnstile a and y

1006
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:50,810
a day

1007
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:55,630
how do we get this into the same form well we need three premises

1008
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:01,150
and one of them has to have a distraction and

1009
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:06,650
use the disjunction elimination rule

1010
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:09,150
and here we go

1011
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:12,990
and it looks horribly treat cheating trivial

1012
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,690
is that

1013
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,880
from here with a gives us a or

1014
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:20,440
and then we were key to this

1015
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,170
and now

1016
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:26,650
we have the distraction over here can be written backwards sorry

1017
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,980
over here we had one of the disjuncts and y here and the other distance

1018
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:34,340
to be the same

1019
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,590
OK so it's

1020
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:42,960
disjunction introduction

1021
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,870
she nomination

1022
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,290
of all

1023
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,320
that's kind of cute

1024
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:55,580
cut into the system is a sort of it

1025
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,810
is is a consequence

1026
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:01,130
this is very much between

1027
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:05,370
a natural deduction system in the sequence

1028
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:08,670
but it is very nice

1029
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,240
when you look

1030
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:16,510
learning things called such logics because it has all of the e's it's easy

1031
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,900
monkeys is

1032
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,350
could calculus

1033
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:24,830
it isolates the

1034
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:28,840
the idea of structural rules or structural

1035
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,420
OK let's go on to those

1036
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:34,260
when structural rule is is the way of

1037
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,950
being the premises

1038
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:47,740
the way of manipulate

1039
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,200
the hypothesis

1040
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:50,420
the the the

1041
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:52,680
things on the left-hand side

1042
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:53,660
one of the

1043
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:59,780
so you've seen if you have this kind of very long list

1044
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:03,130
of interacting atoms

1045
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:06,010
again i recommend the book

1046
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:13,990
i recently to just photocopying the first chapter for forrester here is that we don't

1047
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:18,730
to write these notes say usually just teaches book

1048
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,670
the thing that's quite fun

1049
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:24,470
anyway let's right

1050
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:27,740
down three of the rule give us the logic

1051
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:30,630
so far all before i do that

1052
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:33,790
but we also need

1053
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:38,470
in a way of

1054
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:42,920
what if theorem it's OK now

1055
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,330
you can help

1056
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:50,560
and again since he encounters a lot of them when we move

1057
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:01,430
now some of the theorem we just keep

1058
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,860
things through and if at all but this is something like this we can push

1059
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,840
something through intrigue and empty

1060
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:11,810
for various reasons kind of uncomfortable

1061
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,690
to handle and the left

1062
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:18,440
of the

1063
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,660
the systems that work in about

1064
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,320
so instead we come up with a

1065
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:26,020
we need a

1066
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,560
what's called a zero place

1067
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:33,060
structural connected

1068
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,330
it's not

1069
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:38,160
quite a formula

1070
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:46,010
so it is replaced structural connective and it's called it we zero

1071
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:49,930
and we have two rules for that

1072
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:55,920
so be welcome news for we only need to here

1073
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:05,990
OK anyway

1074
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,950
current and then on the name should

1075
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:16,410
the other way around

1076
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:18,510
epsilon one before w one it's zero

1077
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:24,700
and next to got epsilon to before w two it's zero bit epsilon lose way

1078
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:28,470
smaller than epsilon one so w two it's zero first

1079
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:34,140
and so

1080
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,660
w two is mainly variable and i do the pivot fourteen here

1081
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,070
and i think i show the next slide

1082
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:43,700
forty here now i looked down and i have

1083
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:46,280
the mind to and the minus one here

1084
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:48,620
this act

1085
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:50,300
x one

1086
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:51,470
can go up

1087
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,240
rate two has got abseil on one minus epsilon two

1088
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:59,220
the plant is tiny compared epsilon one so

1089
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:03,240
this is this basically epsilon one whereas this one

1090
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:08,840
can go up to epsilon two plus epsilon three was tiny so basically epsilon two

1091
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:13,970
o yeah and that's the right ones the right to that doesn't really matter

1092
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:19,590
so the fact that there's this one can only got to and that's why small

1093
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:22,990
someone tells the w three must be the leaving variable

1094
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:24,880
and so i do the pivot

1095
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,680
i've solve my problem i didn't do it had

1096
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:31,780
well so whole put the important point here is

1097
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,490
at every iteration now

1098
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,430
even i'm doing degenerative it's

1099
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:40,410
my symbolic object function is strictly increasing

1100
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:44,390
because with epsilon inner i never did generative it

1101
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:49,320
and furthermore you'll never

1102
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:51,720
that's a wonderful

1103
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:54,570
you'll never get a role with only excellence

1104
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,470
having coefficients are zero

1105
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:01,360
because all are pivot operations are reversible

1106
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:04,590
and this is and then we started with an identity matrix here

1107
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:08,510
if you think this all matrix here this is a full rank matrix

1108
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:13,720
it's not possible to do a pivots and reduce the rank of this matrix

1109
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:20,680
and so you always have some epsilon you'll get a rule zero coefficients in this little three by three matrix

1110
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:25,610
you will always have some maps lines you always be doing non-degenerative

1111
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,010
not the

1112
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,700
the objective function in the right hand side is never zero

1113
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:34,840
with the excellence

1114
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:39,160
but they were just symbolic parameters and so once you are done once you've gotten

1115
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:44,130
these are solve the problem once you've just got now the degenerate situation you can

1116
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:48,450
throw away the epsilons and say i don't care about them myself my original problem

1117
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,010
so the perturbation methods very

1118
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:53,410
useful technique for

1119
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:56,910
problem of cycling

1120
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,430
there are other rules that one can talk about

1121
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,410
there is the smallest index rule

1122
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:04,720
which is uh

1123
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:05,680
choose the

1124
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:13,640
variable with the smallest index so entering very blessed be choose entering choose they

1125
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:19,610
very well the positive coefficient that has the smallest index rather than the largest coefficient

1126
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:28,450
so if you pick both entering and leaving variable using the smallest index rule that's known as blanz rule

1127
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:31,660
and blanz rule has been proved not to

1128
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:37,510
you can also select at random

1129
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:40,950
and that's a good thing because

1130
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:41,930
then the

1131
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,510
probability that you may cycle

1132
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,930
this is just like the things around but the next time just like things around

1133
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:50,590
you know you make different selection and you want cycle

1134
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:53,950
so so random selection is also a good rule for

1135
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:56,840
avoiding cycling in practice on a computer

1136
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:59,700
people are also considered

1137
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:05,390
the greatest increase rule actually figure out which are the possible entering variables given me

1138
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,090
the biggest increase in my objective function

1139
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:09,160
but actually if you think about it is

1140
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:10,220
doing a lot of

1141
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,510
numerical linear algebra

1142
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:14,070
purpose that and the

1143
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,990
it is the expense prepare goes up quite a lot and there

1144
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:20,450
and so the rule is actually not competitive

1145
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,610
okay so brief a few words about the geometry of degeneracy

1146
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,360
so i really qualitative scores are

1147
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:32,050
are hyperplane are

1148
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:35,090
perhaps spaces and we are certainly is half spaces

1149
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:39,200
in an dimensional space and so are feasible set is

1150
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,160
in two dimensions is a polygon in higher dimensions is a polytope

1151
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,200
multi faceted

1152
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:47,660
convex object

1153
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:51,780
end the simplex methods going from

1154
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,680
from vertex to vertex so

1155
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:56,030
we started zero zero zero

1156
01:10:56,510 --> 01:11:00,590
and when we increase just one variable at a time so if i pick x

1157
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:06,800
one is my first entering variable when i'd dictionary corresponds to a vertex basically and

1158
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:10,680
offered the first order that's when entering our activity here

1159
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:14,660
if i did the second pivot with say x to be monitoring variable

1160
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,410
i would go to this vertex

1161
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:18,610
if i take my next to that with

1162
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:22,430
with x three is very well go this vertex

1163
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:24,610
and so on

1164
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,570
you'll notice each vertex here has a

1165
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:34,470
it this vertex is the intersection of three planes

1166
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:37,140
and there no in which the three planes

1167
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:44,550
determines the vertex also determines which variables are the three basic variables for the problem

1168
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:45,530
those are the

1169
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:50,320
well no actually tell which ones which variables are zero so it tells me

1170
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,010
it tells you which are the non basics

1171
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:57,890
look at this

1172
01:11:58,390 --> 01:11:59,640
corner up here

1173
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:03,160
when you look at this example in this example

1174
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,410
the corner here actually has

1175
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:09,590
four hour faces defining it as the three colored ones

1176
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:14,910
but then there's the backplane the x two x three plain so there's fore faces

1177
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:18,860
making this single vertex but the vertex is defined by just three

1178
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:24,030
so there's multiple ways of expressing the same geometric point

1179
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:26,360
i pick three if the

1180
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,490
the faces of

1181
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:37,180
i said apparently the termite basic

1182
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,570
variables those available

1183
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:46,050
anyway so

1184
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,120
i have

1185
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,760
multiple ways of representing this vertex here

1186
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:55,990
i could say that

1187
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,010
i could say x two

1188
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:05,510
so this this point here has x to equals zero x one equals zero

1189
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:07,660
it has

1190
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:12,570
this inequality is zero slack so that's

1191
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:14,340
the first and second one is the

1192
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:18,010
as the second one w two is equal to zero at this one

1193
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:20,110
and w one is equal to zero

1194
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:23,970
at this one and so on

1195
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:27,360
i've those four things i pick

1196
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,360
three of them

1197
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,840
to be non basic and one the basic

1198
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:33,840
and so there's

1199
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:40,300
four different ways of doing this is four different dictionaries that represent the single geometric vertex

1200
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:44,280
so that's what that's what the degeneracy is

1201
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:47,550
geometrically it's too many faces coming together

1202
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:49,300
at a single vertex

1203
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:53,890
another thing is

1204
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:57,590
and probably the most important thing is efficiencyof

1205
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:58,970
these algorithms

1206
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:02,050
and the simplex methods are very efficient algorithm and that's

1207
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:05,810
the density

1208
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:14,730
the of the question is not something I have spent habitat have N and so

1209
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:21,070
I can read sigma here you

1210
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:30,640
this you a have a lot of things that you have already talked about it

1211
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:36,110
already is that the quality of

1212
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:51,150
maybe with that later but where we use the properties of the Gaussian kernel here

1213
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:53,370
and there may be a little

1214
01:14:53,380 --> 01:15:00,110
want to mention that because of the way people just started to from the stadium

1215
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:08,670
for Australia and all of the of the of the theorem is not specific enough

1216
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:12,420
of it

1217
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:17,850
but the reason why I'm taking the Gaussian kernel is that we use it in

1218
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:24,930
practice in England and that's for sure each miniature work with the more general kernel

1219
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:33,880
so it was the verification of the elements loss of all of them would have

1220
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,640
issues with so many the other problem is that the

1221
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:48,110
maybe there's nothing wrong with that of the of the of the of of the

1222
01:15:52,810 --> 01:16:00,850
went on with this site in and out and so the that earlier I prefer

1223
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:11,100
and conceded those this result has no more and no more than the consistency results

1224
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,020
in because there

1225
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:17,090
I really don't know if this convergence rates is optimal

1226
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:20,810
I have no lower bound for the moment and so on

1227
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:29,310
I can say that we have stated the consistency of the algorithms

1228
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:38,350
Conseil these are fast rates for 1 class a 2nd remark is that from this

1229
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:45,330
as to convergence from similarity to the target and 0 it can be due right

1230
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:48,670
that's the

1231
01:16:49,150 --> 01:17:00,810
but the real sense of signal had been greater than 1 might expect that converges

1232
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:04,890
to the success

1233
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:16,070
so with respect to for instance the criterion that I have described before

1234
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:22,960
so far from the lens to convergence we can derive the following convergence between sets

1235
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:32,490
I can't well this set is precisely so by definition of of 0 this is

1236
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:37,650
administrative said that evolved to them that times 1 minus the

1237
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:46,790
so from this result we can derive the consistency of 1 class SVM for density

1238
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:53,530
level set estimation

1239
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:57,790
1 of the 20

1240
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:10,790
so we can move to the pool so the proof begins with the as usual

1241
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:13,630
which produces some of the risk

1242
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:19,750
in different terms that we we've separately bound

1243
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:26,300
so I want to enter into details well I don't have time for but I

1244
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:30,550
just like to mention that we need really

1245
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:36,150
introduced so that excessive passing marriage because we know that we can say something on

1246
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:43,730
because the world by definition of s sigma have we know that sigma hat minimizes

1247
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:49,310
by recall version of our sigma so although we would have things to say to

1248
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:54,770
control this term and well then that you have to

1249
01:18:55,150 --> 01:19:04,520
1 OK so the good thing is that uh there are 2 terms that are

1250
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:15,130
negative so we can go there and finally there remains returned to bound for so

1251
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:21,950
the first one is the 1 that we wanted to introduce its referred to as

1252
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:23,250
the estimation error

1253
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:30,960
uh and the 2nd 1 is the funny ones so this is the regularisation error

1254
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:33,870
and to control the tool have to

1255
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:39,070
you can enter their data about yourself your affiliations the paper written stuff like this

1256
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:44,300
you can if you are in charge of an event you can make sure that

1257
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:48,300
it has deadlines proper inside and stuff like this it's because one of the nice

1258
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,800
features is that

1259
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:56,400
if the state is or is available there list of upcoming events automatically created will

1260
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,700
you can download them if i kill you can put in them in you cannot

1261
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:07,070
directly and all this kind of of goodness

1262
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:08,580
editing the wiki

1263
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:16,330
is pretty simple said space the media wiki so it's mostly the same interface and

1264
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,100
the same way you just you can just go to your own page for example

1265
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,290
click on edit

1266
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:24,950
and the idea is that double square bracket

1267
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,900
mark link

1268
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,860
and the type of feeling

1269
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,550
it's giving the first

1270
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:35,390
you have to stop the columns separating the property from the object and then comes

1271
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,610
well you asked for the property

1272
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:41,000
this is i've for another page

1273
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:46,540
or it may be some way depending on the type of the property

1274
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,770
so in both cases here

1275
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:51,010
affiliation nationality

1276
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,250
type of the

1277
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:56,130
of the property is another wiki page

1278
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:58,700
so there will be also wiki page about the

1279
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:04,630
and there will be a wiki page about gracia because both entities by himself and

1280
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:07,660
will probably happen on page in wiki

1281
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:14,260
the other hand if you for example would like to say that you hate to

1282
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:17,170
see you had for example in this case i would say OK then he has

1283
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:19,560
to hate one meter seventy five

1284
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:23,470
so in this case i wouldn't have the page but i would say OK itself

1285
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:28,830
hey type parts of the length of time and then i can add things like

1286
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:33,710
second to things like insurance or whatever i want to add it's able to translate

1287
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:38,110
one to the other in the background for you

1288
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:42,160
but you wouldn't have the page that's called one meter seventy five usually new wiki

1289
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:45,530
so you don't want to have to link to a page but rather to where

1290
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:48,650
you really and then this value is added to europe

1291
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:53,300
and it in this case

1292
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:57,480
so i was expecting actually did all if you would get some print out of

1293
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:58,380
the slide

1294
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:02,180
so these are are created to actually be a quick she'd she'd to look at

1295
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:02,840
and how old

1296
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:09,000
the wiki markup works to live in during hands on presentation so you can easily

1297
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,430
enter then you have all the slides on the USB stick

1298
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:17,800
so you can just take a look at them and their and then you come

1299
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:22,180
back you can also open to modify like this kind of changes are actually done

1300
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:26,030
much better she cheats on the web if you just search for them is that

1301
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:30,310
whenever you have the media wiki cheatsheet it's basically the same thing because it is

1302
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:31,980
based on wiki

1303
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:37,500
so just go quickly so things like three apostrophes make it both actually to work

1304
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,510
and to make it italic

1305
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:43,220
that was a link

1306
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:47,280
that then you can also given a chance to text links

1307
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:53,940
so then it clings for example two cr but it's the text risk ratio and

1308
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:59,350
because you have a case the world which is much more important in other languages

1309
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:03,050
than english english doesn't have his that much but

1310
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,840
slavic languages for example

1311
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,970
very nice to have this kind of paternalistic

1312
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:13,080
and the week is basically case sensitive

1313
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:15,070
besides for the first letter

1314
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:19,510
the strange that in the media wiki architecture you can switch it off but in

1315
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:21,050
the usual setting

1316
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:24,490
i it is fully case sensitive

1317
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:28,590
but for the first letter which is always treated as a capital letter

1318
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:31,770
and there are things in unicode so you can use are

1319
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:36,090
all the funny that as we have in slavic countries all the funny as we

1320
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:40,220
have in spain or in france and all the

1321
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:43,910
the numbers of characters you can you you having an asian countries in arab countries

1322
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:48,150
and so on to this there should be no problem using unicode they actually a

1323
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:54,870
number of semantic mediawiki installations running on a red chinese so we know that

1324
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:01,750
this work and forty arabic one we had no opensource developer sitting in israel who

1325
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:06,860
made all the changes for right to left text for the thing it

1326
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:11,000
really we are actually two edits right left text in the wiki

1327
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:14,840
because it feels so very different but i think it's very useful use user them

1328
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:16,970
but just when you try it out

1329
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:22,370
the cursor jumps all over time value typing especially if you make something things that

1330
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:26,600
partially left to right and partially right to left because then you have text then

1331
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,640
you have number which goes the other direction then jump back to the beginning again

1332
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,420
a lot

1333
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:38,560
so what is semantic markup that is two

1334
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:39,730
two weeks

1335
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:45,270
you can say the the page belongs to a category is already able to store

1336
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:51,370
possible in media wiki just put in category colon into to it and then this

1337
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:53,340
page belongs to the category

1338
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:55,350
we interpret this

1339
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:56,990
as RDF time

1340
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,530
which means that

1341
01:24:58,540 --> 01:24:59,810
the page

1342
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:03,580
due to the topic of the page you are on

1343
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:06,270
belong to the category

1344
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:12,260
are pointing to in the sample of wilson was for example say the category city

1345
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:15,120
which means that wilson is the city

1346
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:17,830
so that we can now it's OK

1347
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,460
this page is talking about the city

1348
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:23,040
the second part is

1349
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:27,560
the titling of a certain type of

1350
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:31,780
from page one to page to go to the page p one

1351
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,710
the subject of the triple

1352
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:36,720
and you have this is

1353
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:40,660
w two double at two college

1354
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:41,930
and then the

1355
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:44,290
link then do well you after

1356
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,280
triple or the object of a triple

1357
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:51,190
so for example was on left is located in

1358
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:55,260
callan callan career so i'm saying the city was

1359
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:57,720
it is located in korea

1360
01:25:57,730 --> 01:26:01,270
and the same thing values the city was

1361
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:04,440
has a population of three million six hundred thousand

1362
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:09,140
it's basically it with

1363
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:14,520
annotating to wilkie

1364
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,640
should go ahead

1365
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:26,620
there may be some interest the first place this year i

1366
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:30,760
you get in your eye for the city so you may always have an external

1367
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:34,470
ontology that just you're reusing your eye display

1368
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:38,480
so it is that we are providing a URI

1369
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:39,900
the semantic wiki

1370
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:43,950
so it's just like well OK be doing beginning in the fall URI so you

1371
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:49,200
don't have to worry about this which is about the linked data things and documentation

1372
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,070
and so on and so on

1373
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:55,230
but you can also decided you actually don't want to use the you're right it's

1374
01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:56,950
automatically created by the wiki

1375
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:59,510
but you already have a good you're eyes cities

1376
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:03,500
have to look in hindsight and compare myself to the best single stack whatever and

1377
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,450
the problem is

1378
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:08,100
i guess the problem can be best described by

1379
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:12,020
but i call my uncle made to me last

1380
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:15,750
last year when he commented i lost two million dollars in the stock market is

1381
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:19,180
really what happened said well if i had invested my money here

1382
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,360
and then i move my money here

1383
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:24,380
and then i move my money here and so on i would have made two

1384
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:25,890
million dollars

1385
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:28,660
and if that's how you're gonna

1386
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:31,990
measure your performance you have a lot of regret so

1387
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:36,720
so so that's kind of why we measure performance after the fact to the to

1388
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,780
to the best single function and that compared to

1389
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:42,960
the best of changing function although you can get these nice

1390
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:45,160
changing function bounds

1391
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,950
other cool things you can do it

1392
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:51,580
article things you can do in this setting

1393
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:55,330
i have the so-called multi armed bandit problem it is a nice paper about this

1394
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:57,930
called how to gamble in a rigged casino

1395
01:27:57,990 --> 01:28:02,870
OK and this is a classic problem going back to statistics

1396
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:05,800
from a long time ago and the idea is a multi armed bandits

1397
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:09,750
o sorry the the multi armed bandit you have several

1398
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:13,230
slot machines each one is one armed bandit

1399
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:17,710
you have to decide which machine to pull

1400
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,530
and each time he possum flemish and you get some money

1401
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:23,770
you don't know how much you would have gotten from all the other slot machine

1402
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:28,530
so it's kind of one of these classic problems in exploration exploitation trade-off how do

1403
01:28:28,530 --> 01:28:31,930
you decide which one machine the poor so they make as much money as possible

1404
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:35,970
and what they give their actually algorithms for deciding which slot machines to pull

1405
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:40,100
using randomness that will guarantee that are making almost as much money is if they

1406
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:44,770
just sat and played the best single slot machine in hindsight

1407
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:47,970
trying to take this back to the learning setting

1408
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:49,840
the learning setting we have these

1409
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:52,870
functions which were compared herself to

1410
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:57,180
i want to point out that these functions can also be they can either be

1411
01:28:57,180 --> 01:29:01,940
you know linear separators but they can also be just some other weird class of

1412
01:29:04,290 --> 01:29:07,020
that also are learning algorithms themselves

1413
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:09,480
that look at the sequence of data you can think of them like experts they

1414
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,110
look at the sequence of data and make a prediction in the future so these

1415
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:13,460
functions could be

1416
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,960
decision tree learning and neural nets

1417
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:21,550
you know an SVM and you want to get the best performing best of all

1418
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:25,350
three worlds you want to get an algorithm that when you use it online will

1419
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:27,360
make a few mistakes is the best

1420
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:28,970
of the three

1421
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:31,520
so in the in this setting

1422
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:34,040
in the multi armed bandit setting not even trickier

1423
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,390
you only have to essentially yesterday

1424
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:39,580
commit to one algorithm before you even

1425
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:42,180
i know what's going on you have to actually choose one of the functions before

1426
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:45,240
you see any of the predictions you choose the function

1427
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:46,870
you run your algorithm

1428
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:49,850
whatever you find out its prediction you go with that you have no choice

1429
01:29:49,870 --> 01:29:53,680
you go with now we majority announced the band would you go with prediction we

1430
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,660
find out i got

1431
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,930
maybe then you move to another function

1432
01:29:57,950 --> 01:30:00,640
you go with its prediction

1433
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:01,700
you see that

1434
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:05,200
i had to go with conservatives minus you see that right

1435
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:07,760
you so stay there

1436
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:10,430
OK and you keep going and so on

1437
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:17,200
this repeats OK so actually hear the nice thing the nice thing is that you

1438
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,410
don't have to run all other algorithms each time

1439
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:20,470
the only run

1440
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:23,370
each each time you only one round one of your predictors to see what to

1441
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:25,830
and still you get to guarantee

1442
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:30,390
unfortunately the guaranteed that is now linear in the number of

1443
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:32,200
functions you have

1444
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:37,350
but still you can actually do better than that in this very difficult

1445
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,970
any question here

1446
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:49,200
so you

1447
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:52,950
again we're comparing ourselves

1448
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:54,240
so should be

1449
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,350
i regret

1450
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:59,790
i'm sorry but bunch of mistakes my slides i had a talk with many more

1451
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:03,180
formulas and then i was kind informed that there were too many formulas in the

1452
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:08,180
toxic so i kind of last night i went to try to take on many

1453
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:12,580
anyway this should be the regret saying expected regret that compared to again compared to

1454
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:14,580
some class of functions f

1455
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,870
and here this capital after

1456
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:18,580
represents the size of the

1457
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:24,180
number of functions in the family

1458
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:30,560
it's easier to compare yourself

1459
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,990
in a large window

1460
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:33,200
to the best

1461
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:35,350
function because you don't have to adapt quickly

1462
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:37,430
now i'm comparing myself to

1463
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:38,970
five large windows

1464
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:42,870
that's a hundred or you know ten thousand comparing myself to the best algorithm in

1465
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:45,060
the last ten thousand

1466
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,240
examples only after that myself

1467
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:49,160
so once every ten thousand

1468
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:52,560
steps to the best algorithm

1469
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:56,680
to the best function sorry in the family lived him

1470
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:58,490
if the window is one

1471
01:31:58,490 --> 01:31:59,940
such as one wants to

1472
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:05,630
that's said idea

1473
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,150
i took helps was trying to kernel

1474
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:12,870
talk transformers as they say let's start to work on

1475
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:14,360
the idea of

1476
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:16,470
a computable

1477
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:17,930
function k

1478
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:21,360
functional computable by an algorithm

1479
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:26,730
this is the approach to trying to formalize

1480
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:30,780
you know in real life in finitistic y

1481
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:35,270
what you what you mean by carrying out calculation or something like that

1482
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:36,830
so you say

1483
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:40,130
his this computing technique is the cell group

1484
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:46,630
this mechanism which will produce the ants outside value of the function

1485
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:50,320
as few different ways we can see to do that

1486
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:55,750
informally and say here for a function of a whole bunch of variables

1487
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:59,780
in place typeface function f

1488
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:05,930
is compatible with this procedure algorithm which the which can compute its value value y

1489
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:12,920
we've got an informal idea of what it means to calculate effectively to compute things

1490
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:14,570
that algorithms

1491
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:17,960
but some of those things of course might involve us taking a very very very

1492
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,650
long time to do stuff

1493
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,350
do we care about that

1494
01:33:21,370 --> 01:33:23,100
as mathematicians we die

1495
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:28,120
there's also can be done eventually in a finite number of steps you don't mind

1496
01:33:28,170 --> 01:33:31,490
and there's a few other simplifications of that sort that you see on

1497
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:33,840
i just stream coming up to second

1498
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:39,040
there's lots of different things we might say can computable but we're abstracting away

1499
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:44,680
specific things like we have time or you know electrons to park in the universe

1500
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,940
and this kind of thing in our calculations

1501
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:51,180
so in a sense since the computability is not human ones

1502
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:54,100
but it's just effective it's fun

1503
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:55,380
it's concept

1504
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:02,000
what happened in the thirties the people kept for putting forward some different approaches computability

1505
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:07,730
in an attempt to understand these issues around kernel theorem around the building program

1506
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:11,890
but what turned out was that the various techniques for

1507
01:34:11,930 --> 01:34:15,520
saying what it is for have effective computability

1508
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:18,360
alternatively assign

1509
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:20,200
what we're not going to do today

1510
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:23,680
set up three different approaches

1511
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:27,760
three different approaches to computability

1512
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:30,670
and start on the arguments but the

1513
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:33,150
would lead us to sign the viral side

1514
01:34:33,170 --> 01:34:34,690
the different enough

1515
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:37,300
that it's it's non-trivial

1516
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:39,280
i will see what they are

1517
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:42,000
keep that in mind got about three

1518
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:44,330
techniques of computability

1519
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:49,680
is this full concept we can calculate the value function by some of the algorithm

1520
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:53,500
and let's try to formalize what that means

1521
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:57,820
his these issues what about what would be the computability

1522
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:00,680
they have taken be if it must be fine arts

1523
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:03,920
the instructions themselves must be fine

1524
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:08,780
OK the agent carries out the instructions meaningless here machine

1525
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:10,420
just is steps

1526
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:11,950
you can check what you've done

1527
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:15,490
the agent carries out the instructions discrete stepwise manner

1528
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:17,150
my fuzzy logic here

1529
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:18,100
you can't say

1530
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:20,290
we're not going to say that it's by the

1531
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:21,870
or somehow

1532
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:24,530
not clear whether nice carry step

1533
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:27,750
each one does occur doesn't occur and so on

1534
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,200
so here's a bunch of

1535
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:33,940
of principles around what we're trying to achieve

1536
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:37,030
the site will move to pretty quickly is

1537
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:44,670
is an idea of calculi of having three different approaches

1538
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,120
of these sorts is here

1539
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:50,180
OK only number ten is contentious

1540
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:53,330
OK well have to look at what that's about

1541
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:55,950
because i don't have an intuitive feeling that

1542
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,440
it's contentious

1543
01:35:57,490 --> 01:36:00,410
but some people do some putting in that

1544
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,070
you want to look at

1545
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:05,980
rogers rogers book on recursive functions

1546
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,800
which is in

1547
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:09,480
which is in the

1548
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:17,180
bibliography references

1549
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:20,760
so i want to make any comment and we're going to satisfy all happy just

1550
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,650
receiving this place i go along

1551
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:30,280
in order to even start one of the things you've got to colourlayout hold

1552
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:35,610
core beginning ideas much less actually never developed the idea is that we're trying to

1553
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:46,950
alright let's keep going

1554
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:53,900
the three methods we can look at cold

1555
01:36:53,930 --> 01:36:57,400
recursive functions of partial recursive functions goes

1556
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:02,360
sometimes when you apply the results from the up partial function didn't start one

1557
01:37:02,430 --> 01:37:04,680
part of techniques

1558
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:08,880
and i'm going to call that this is my formal idea i'm going to call

1559
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,130
this an axiomatic approach

1560
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:14,680
so someone says what do you mean by the algorithm will follow an algorithm or

1561
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:17,900
something it's constructive by procedure

1562
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:19,600
one approach is

1563
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:22,580
this is of things called recursive functions

1564
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:24,570
and the way they defined

1565
01:37:24,650 --> 01:37:29,700
is by setting up some of the axioms so all these functions are recursive functions

1566
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:33,110
if you apply these rules these other ones will be to

1567
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:35,020
and therefore the cosine

1568
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:38,920
continues on its merry way the only thing is it might be a little more

1569
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:41,970
or it might be

1570
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:44,040
four might be very

1571
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:49,580
let's go back four

1572
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:54,260
this will be the case in a question one well of course the most interesting

1573
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:57,570
cases what happens there is exactly one

1574
01:37:57,570 --> 01:38:01,550
partridge is exactly just write phrases

1575
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,350
two active goal

1576
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,360
just right

1577
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:07,950
when a is equal to one

1578
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:16,800
so you start service cosine he gets to the design ever there

1579
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:18,540
the function zero

1580
01:38:20,780 --> 01:38:22,730
i have a

1581
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:25,510
visually for the only time this

1582
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:30,420
it was it didn't work at all but on the other hand the data for

1583
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:35,950
the last hour the people who worked there were not intrinsically baseball players

1584
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:41,570
since will use the equation of the pendulum instead

1585
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:47,790
that's a lot easier to match the the pendulum itself

1586
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,840
it's on them because i declare today

1587
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:53,050
and it swings back and forth

1588
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:58,250
and here i am really sick when the the angle the variable is not x

1589
01:38:58,250 --> 01:39:03,030
or y but they the angle to the data is one let's say about race

1590
01:39:04,110 --> 01:39:08,090
and starts there and it swings back and forth

1591
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:10,130
it's not them so it

1592
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:13,140
never loses amplitude particularly place which

1593
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:15,030
i would like

1594
01:39:15,530 --> 01:39:21,330
so i want someone with who knows how to better baseball that was the problem

1595
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:23,230
last hour

1596
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:24,730
two people

1597
01:39:24,740 --> 01:39:29,520
one two release all stand up and try to hold somebody releases

1598
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:32,580
and then somebody who actually very skillful

1599
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:37,630
i should apply the impulse unit balls of exactly one when it gets to the

1600
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:38,880
equilibrium point

1601
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:40,550
so can that

1602
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:44,060
you can look like this one

1603
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:52,950
OK somebody like that

1604
01:39:54,490 --> 01:40:07,050
right now

1605
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:10,470
OK so we really to OK

1606
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,020
somebody told handle

1607
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:14,340
all i could be

1608
01:40:18,770 --> 01:40:23,100
OK so just call it what you take to be one gradient

1609
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:27,400
when it gets

1610
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,690
he really said what it gets the value of the get down way down

1611
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:32,380
and they on this side

1612
01:40:32,410 --> 01:40:34,370
OK you left the right

1613
01:40:34,370 --> 01:40:37,430
OK better with that part

1614
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,820
mean this work

1615
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:43,340
it's also set prior to help

1616
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:45,950
i'm not very stable

1617
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:02,550
OK for you gotta be see where it's going

1618
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:07,220
but you stand so guys can want to send you the right

1619
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:10,240
so that's ghostwriter

1620
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:13,370
i believe that the world

1621
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:22,140
i have a false alarm or

1622
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:26,260
the red sox have child

1623
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:40,950
if did harder

1624
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:45,100
you even harder it would have reversed direction going that way if he had not

1625
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:49,140
quite as hard it would have continued on but more

1626
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:53,300
with less still the cosine t but with less amplitude of but if you get

1627
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:55,720
it exactly right it's fun to try to do

1628
01:41:55,780 --> 01:42:01,710
so really in our department is necessary this but in practice in the years you

1629
01:42:01,710 --> 01:42:05,710
so these content of course and instances of

1630
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:11,170
methods that are used for us logical patterns in the domain dependent because they

1631
01:42:11,180 --> 01:42:14,990
allowed to use specific vocabulary

1632
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,310
examples include

1633
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:22,480
but to suppress part of general participation to an event in any event or how

1634
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:26,920
to model plan or medical guidelines or essays order

1635
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:33,970
all research topic or legal contract or inflammation situation timeinterval so meets of so suitable

1636
01:42:33,970 --> 01:42:38,430
solution that could be very general but also quite specific to domain and can be

1637
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:40,090
organised into

1638
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:45,190
this could be collected this the first kind of pattern and is being collected in

1639
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:48,970
the ODP portal that i've already mentioned and that has

1640
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:57,240
some function arising in between to submit to evaluate to contribute to organise this domain

1641
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:04,770
based representation of this part is also an annotation schema that allows you to label

1642
01:43:04,770 --> 01:43:08,190
parts of aspects of the pattern and as you can do in software engineering for

1643
01:43:08,190 --> 01:43:14,560
example so i mean altering ten pros and cons and so on

1644
01:43:15,050 --> 01:43:18,930
one example is a gentle pattern

1645
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:25,200
so you have here the representation the semantic wiki plus semantic forms plus semantic workflow

1646
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:29,380
representation of this button on the on the fourth of

1647
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:33,260
and so this is due to the metadata schema

1648
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:37,590
and you have also the visualisation of some of the characterising elements of the pattern

1649
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:38,610
the graph

1650
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:43,850
by the way means that you can express i just the temporal

1651
01:43:43,930 --> 01:43:47,200
and you can have sensation of it for example i can

1652
01:43:47,290 --> 01:43:53,040
the role of the research but also farther north south player with it and can

1653
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:55,780
use to use directly these and simply

1654
01:43:55,790 --> 01:44:00,570
so the simplest time interval in which you can use the property to express the

1655
01:44:00,570 --> 01:44:05,230
fact that the interval date has a beginning and the start date and end date

1656
01:44:05,370 --> 01:44:06,330
and then you

1657
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:13,760
can use these for it is something that for example implements kind of an mission

1658
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:18,930
logic part but applied to a content aspect which is pressing time intervals

1659
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:25,170
another example is part of which you can display space for example transitivity of part

1660
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:28,340
of in you that you made by the way we may want not to you

1661
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:34,160
was in one context in which the seed is is also could be problematic

1662
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:39,000
in this case of course this is always a plus extensive you don't spend time

1663
01:44:39,010 --> 01:44:40,820
of these

1664
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:45,770
this more complicated if they want to suppress the top the fact that i'm participating

1665
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:51,010
in these events in this talk today and not and when you go that symbols

1666
01:44:51,010 --> 01:44:56,120
and for example doing very similar one i have to use DNA logical pattern but

1667
01:44:56,160 --> 01:45:00,060
can also use these content oriented aspects so i can reuse the fact that they

1668
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:01,060
can express

1669
01:45:01,150 --> 01:45:07,580
things related to the personnel two objects participating in events sometimes by using this is

1670
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:11,350
like having a template OK in the sense but you can be used directly in

1671
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:16,350
your ontology editor and then you can specialize it by renaming the elements of subclassing

1672
01:45:16,350 --> 01:45:23,140
them or instantiate them directly for suppressing the time war situation

1673
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:29,370
was included centroid war and some time ago

1674
01:45:30,330 --> 01:45:33,160
another example is rule based on you can have rules

1675
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:35,980
indexed by some examples

1676
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:41,010
aspects so i can participate in i can have the role of to tall tutorial

1677
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:44,850
this time but possibly not in one hour

1678
01:45:44,910 --> 01:45:49,610
and then you can be other domain oriented and so on

1679
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:55,140
so i can specialize things for example when a about support to participation of an

1680
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:59,560
object in an event but also taking part in a public enterprise activities are found

1681
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:04,190
the semantic web project so on so you can have a partial order of

1682
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:09,020
this content patterns or can compose them for example i can create apart like by

1683
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:11,640
chemical treatment by using the

1684
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:16,750
content patterns and create links between them

1685
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:21,010
so let's use it how much time they have

1686
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:24,020
the image

1687
01:46:24,030 --> 01:46:29,840
OK i tried to be to give you some examples and of course

1688
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:35,010
it is important for testing ontologies and for use in the article unit test based

1689
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,730
in this case i have the semantic web conference ontology the

1690
01:46:41,210 --> 01:46:46,250
users already some patterns that can be recognised that is not species that it uses

1691
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:50,440
it so one point is that if you explicit the fact that you're using best

1692
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:58,340
practices is that we make evaluation additional by anyone easier for any ontology so in

1693
01:46:58,350 --> 01:47:04,270
product class they typically use an entity relation patterns and in the topic but they

1694
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:06,460
do use some

1695
01:47:06,490 --> 01:47:07,980
comm department so

1696
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,810
this is topic models asking destructive and

1697
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:15,260
represents the fact that they want to have

1698
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:18,300
or uncooked spaghetti

1699
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:25,550
electricity very well we call those insulating

1700
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:29,240
porcelain is a very good insulator

1701
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,800
three electrical wiring in your house

1702
01:47:31,870 --> 01:47:33,100
is made of copper

1703
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:36,430
because it is such a good conductor

1704
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:38,340
dry air

1705
01:47:38,430 --> 01:47:39,840
is very

1706
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:45,890
you would air is a lousy insulator that's why

1707
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,270
we have problems in september

1708
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:49,530
and not

1709
01:47:49,540 --> 01:47:53,210
in february

1710
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:58,170
it is not dangerous to touch at home your electric cords

1711
01:47:58,230 --> 01:47:59,500
the reason is

1712
01:47:59,510 --> 01:48:00,810
that the outside

1713
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:03,710
is properly protected was an installation

1714
01:48:03,730 --> 01:48:09,020
but if you cut the wire you strip of the ends they use copper

1715
01:48:09,070 --> 01:48:11,100
that is really

1716
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:13,100
twenty electric current occurs

1717
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:16,660
but there is no danger because it's properly protected

1718
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:18,520
this piece right now

1719
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,900
it's potentially very dangerous

1720
01:48:21,150 --> 01:48:23,950
we're going to be ten minutes break you can be sure

1721
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,210
i will remove this piece

1722
01:48:26,270 --> 01:48:32,270
and why do you think i will remove this piece

1723
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:34,340
because some of you might just

1724
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:36,530
plug it in

1725
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:37,990
and then

1726
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:41,840
what do you think someone touches that that is very nature

1727
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:43,890
so we're going to remove that

1728
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:46,340
but you have to be seen the idea

1729
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:49,190
of an insulating on the outside

1730
01:48:49,210 --> 01:48:57,380
and conducting copper on the inside

1731
01:48:57,460 --> 01:48:58,560
you see here

1732
01:48:58,610 --> 01:49:00,180
the helium balloon

1733
01:49:00,270 --> 01:49:03,230
balloon filled with helium

1734
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,540
suppose we have this belong here

1735
01:49:05,590 --> 01:49:07,180
and the building

1736
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:09,440
is not positively charged

1737
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:11,440
and the balloon is not negative

1738
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:13,150
recall that neutral

1739
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:16,730
there's no net charge money

1740
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:18,430
but i approach it

1741
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:19,880
glass rolled

1742
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:26,320
and the glass rod has been raw silk positive charge

1743
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:29,150
will come

1744
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:30,690
two to run

1745
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:32,290
even though

1746
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:33,800
it is not for

1747
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:35,630
why does it do that

1748
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:42,730
electrons are being attracted by the positive charge and they can move very easily

1749
01:49:42,770 --> 01:49:48,040
and so electrons will move to this site some electrons move to the site of

1750
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:50,010
the book

1751
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:51,750
but you can create

1752
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:56,890
try out of nothing so the other side automatically becomes a little bit positive

1753
01:49:56,950 --> 01:50:02,070
because the whole thing is still neutral for no net charge on the so now

1754
01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:03,100
you get

1755
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:07,160
separation of charges in the balloon

1756
01:50:07,170 --> 01:50:08,820
the negative charge

1757
01:50:08,850 --> 01:50:11,340
is attracted by the positive charge

1758
01:50:11,410 --> 01:50:16,680
the positive charge is repelled by the positive charge but these are closer together than

1759
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,420
these are and so on

1760
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:22,340
the attractive force wins over the republic four

1761
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:23,790
and that is called

1762
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:28,450
and i will demonstrate that

1763
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:31,460
before i demonstrate that i must be sure

1764
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:35,750
that that balloon is completely neutral that there no chart on the board

1765
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:37,240
in order to do that

1766
01:50:37,250 --> 01:50:38,770
i will have to touch it

1767
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:40,480
i will have to considered

1768
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:43,610
i will have all kinds of things to make sure

1769
01:50:43,650 --> 01:50:52,330
that whatever charges on it has been removed otherwise it's not fair experiment

1770
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:06,540
from now on

1771
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:07,700
what will

1772
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:12,920
you just guess and it so i could anticipate

1773
01:51:12,950 --> 01:51:15,060
because it

1774
01:51:15,110 --> 01:51:20,900
that's what do you think this is finer space

1775
01:51:20,930 --> 01:51:24,780
we're looking at functions of finer scale and we're

1776
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:26,670
this is it

1777
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:29,310
multiresolution solar

1778
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:33,110
power is to come and so

1779
01:51:35,210 --> 01:51:39,170
this space on the same thing

1780
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:40,850
when he

1781
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:43,080
finer scale scale

1782
01:51:43,090 --> 01:51:44,840
shifted by two

1783
01:51:44,850 --> 01:51:46,930
dilated by two

1784
01:51:47,010 --> 01:51:49,220
refined by two whatever

1785
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:51,560
is that good for

1786
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:54,800
key is that

1787
01:51:54,830 --> 01:51:56,470
refinement OK

1788
01:51:57,970 --> 01:52:03,460
many many papers about wavelets

1789
01:52:03,490 --> 01:52:05,810
will begin with

1790
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:08,710
these assumptions

1791
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:17,020
well i think it was the first to write down to put my stuff

1792
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:21,280
often what i'm hoping to was like save you the trouble of going through the

1793
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:26,530
assumption this is essentially what's going on we have a sequence of more and more

1794
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:28,190
refined spaces

1795
01:52:28,250 --> 01:52:31,690
and we have a function with this translates

1796
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:33,410
it spans the zero

1797
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:35,170
and then scaled to

1798
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:39,490
here the scale would be for the the scale would be eighty be feared eighteen

1799
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:41,780
months and it's shifts

1800
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:45,060
and everybody recognises five

1801
01:52:45,070 --> 01:52:48,020
OK so you have to do that

1802
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:50,790
squeezes the function

1803
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:52,480
by a factor of two

1804
01:52:53,910 --> 01:53:01,490
of course the model problem he always are

1805
01:53:01,530 --> 01:53:04,550
one or fifty

1806
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:07,430
box function

1807
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:10,410
and then we said what be zero

1808
01:53:10,540 --> 01:53:13,390
we describe these are last time

1809
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:18,630
if if this is the box functional roles are one

1810
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:24,760
i heard it described yesterday as the boxcar function so maybe that's also useful word

1811
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:28,120
what's in the zero

1812
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:30,820
take that function

1813
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,070
they call it shifts integer shifts

1814
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:38,130
the color combinations and what have you got

1815
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:39,840
step function right

1816
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:41,620
piecewise constant

1817
01:53:41,630 --> 01:53:45,320
so piecewise constant

1818
01:53:45,390 --> 01:53:49,300
on the unit interval

1819
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:52,050
you know it

1820
01:53:53,910 --> 01:53:56,630
let me ask about the one

1821
01:53:57,900 --> 01:54:01,090
you withdraw we those pictures just

1822
01:54:01,110 --> 01:54:04,780
just constant every interval but jump between

1823
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:07,130
OK what about the one

1824
01:54:07,170 --> 01:54:10,810
two what's the graph of f two g

1825
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:12,170
it's of course

1826
01:54:12,190 --> 01:54:17,590
the same thing but only going to a half

1827
01:54:17,650 --> 01:54:21,650
what's in the space the one that

1828
01:54:21,660 --> 01:54:25,180
if i take all combinations of those guys

1829
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:26,450
the shifts

1830
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:27,630
that's what i mean

1831
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:31,640
of all combinations of this and all its

1832
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:34,780
it's half integer shifts

1833
01:54:34,830 --> 01:54:37,840
i can get piecewise constant

1834
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:40,690
but the pieces of the half

1835
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:42,380
after you know

1836
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:46,690
so it is piecewise constant

1837
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:53,160
on i say at intervals

1838
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:55,840
you can imagine

1839
01:54:55,860 --> 01:55:00,490
the next extraordinary piecewise constant quarter rules and then

1840
01:55:00,510 --> 01:55:04,160
smooth function

1841
01:55:04,170 --> 01:55:10,110
whole function our whole space like whatever like that
