1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
now the algorithmic framework for all of this

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,870
has tended to have the following high-level picture

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,580
OK so there is some manifold

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,750
OK sitting in a high dimensional space

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,430
i don't know this manifold

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,980
i get a bunch of points on the manifold

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,410
so what am i to do

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,890
OK i have to recover something after recovery the maps from the manifold to some

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,250
low dimensional space to learn some function whose domain is the manifold and so on

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,960
what people do is well i don't know the manifold i have a bunch of

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,270
points let me actually make some kind of formation like structure of the graph like

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,310
structure by compared to combine could by a

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,620
connecting nearby points to each other

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,020
and i make a graph like this and this is my approximation to the manifold

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,390
and who the hell knows whether this is good or bad but this is what

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,390
people do a literal actually prove some theorems about this

17
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,460
kind of construction

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,430
but this is what people do the bayesian framework is i connect nearby points to

19
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,290
each other and nearby means nearby in the euclidean space in which the points are

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,520
embedded because that's the only distance that can measure

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,890
all my points are living in a euclidean space given any two points they can

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,660
measure the euclidean distance and that in fact the only thing i can do

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,730
OK so i make this nearest neighbour graph

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,930
so it's common to many of these methods and that's going to be my approximation

25
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,000
to the manifold and so if i wanted to do something on the manifold i

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,730
will do something on the graph instead

27
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,020
so let's discuss the first of these schemes OK this is isomap

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,620
is an algorithm i'm good now go through several algorithms most of these are the

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,410
terms do not come with its

30
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,520
proofs of the correctness of any sort

31
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,080
and then to give you a sense of what motivated people to think of algorithms

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,370
of this sort

33
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,810
and what would be more precise versions of the questions

34
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,980
these are the terms were trying to

35
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,410
sort of

36
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,160
so this is an algorithm isomap and this is what it does

37
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,120
you construct the nearest neighbour graph from all the state of data

38
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,980
you find the shortest path distances between all these points along the graph

39
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,600
OK you can use like stars at the time was something to find the shortest

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,620
path distance between all points

41
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,430
on this

42
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,580
so now i've got this set of distances d i j

43
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,600
this is already becoming somewhat intrinsic object because notice that d i g is not

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,950
simply the euclidean distance between the points x i and x j

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,310
OK so you made a graph where every vertex is identified with the data point

46
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,890
and between them

47
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,180
hi it's data point six i and the g data point six j

48
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,330
that is the euclidean distance between them but you made this

49
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,960
nearest neighbour graph and that is the shortest path distance between them and i've got

50
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,790
this this

51
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:19,730
new distance metric and this distance metric is trying to simulate the geodesic distance between

52
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,830
those two points if you are trying to go along the manifold

53
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,910
so the natural question is is this the idea close

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,640
to the geodesic distance

55
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,370
between x i and x j

56
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,020
and that i think under certain circumstances it is true

57
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,020
but this

58
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,110
sort of distance

59
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:46,320
distances between points and i would like to embed it into a low dimensional space

60
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,290
and embedded using this scheme called multidimensional scaling

61
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:57,150
so what is multidimensional scaling

62
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,900
multidimensional scaling is the following idea

63
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,440
i give you a matrix of distances

64
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,820
you go from that

65
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,280
two matrix of inner products somehow

66
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,810
and then from a matrix of inner products you go to an embedding

67
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,680
in two vectors whose distances

68
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,030
with will correspond to the distances that you've been given

69
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,660
by this distance metric

70
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,410
so how do we go from distances to inner products

71
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,000
you just make use of this identity

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,930
that if you take two points x and y two two vectors x and y

73
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,310
which are identified with point

74
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,110
then this is just

75
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,680
the distance between x and y the euclidean distance can be expressed in terms of

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,870
the inner product that gives you a relationship between inner products and distances and this

77
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,310
relationship of course is true only if

78
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,070
the distances are consistent with the inner products

79
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,830
this is actually not the case if the distances were actually distances geodesic distances on

80
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,620
the manifold

81
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,600
so multidimensional scaling says you give me a distance metric distance

82
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,650
a matrix of distances

83
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,330
if there is a set of points

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,110
in a euclidean space

85
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,500
from which this distance matrix could have arisen

86
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,580
then i can find those points for you

87
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,790
so if indeed there were a set of points from which these distance made this

88
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,460
distance matrix rows

89
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,370
then the inner products between those points which satisfy this relationship

90
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,740
and you can actually solve this and see that to call from d to d

91
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,560
which is the matrix of inner products is given by this

92
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,540
OK this is a little bit of linear algebra

93
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,320
last time we did

94
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,910
we discussed

95
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,110
the interference pattern of

96
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,560
two openings in the screen

97
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,820
which established the wave character of light

98
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,810
today i'm going to expand that

99
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,580
two and

100
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,680
capital and we will make and thousands of openings in the screen

101
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,140
when it comes to optical light we call those gratings

102
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,650
suppose here

103
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,780
each one of those dot

104
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,100
is a small opening in the screen

105
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,110
we all could be split perpendicular to the black

106
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,600
and imagine that plane waves are coming in

107
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,320
so each one of those openings

108
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,610
going to be

109
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,690
organ sources

110
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,740
and they're going to

111
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,780
radiates always

112
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,690
the the question now out we want to answer

113
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,770
if we

114
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,660
look in the direction theta

115
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,190
one way from the normal to that

116
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,960
screen what is then the light intensity that you will see a result of the

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,110
interference of all these

118
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,940
oregon sources

119
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,910
suppose that the separation between two adjacent sources

120
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,240
is d

121
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,180
words you is one

122
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,800
and here is the

123
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,890
this is a blow up

124
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,100
of what you see here

125
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,720
you see hundreds maybe thousands i have only two

126
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,270
and if that separation is the

127
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,860
then i can calculate

128
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,830
the phase difference between those two

129
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,580
this is the data

130
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,550
this is no different from

131
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,720
what we did

132
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,780
last time for the double slit

133
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,780
the past difference

134
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,940
this spherical wave to appoint far away

135
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:53,160
and an angle theta and this spherical wave that difference is this

136
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,720
and this is the

137
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,780
sin theta

138
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,470
so we will introduce just like we did before

139
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,750
the phase angle delta

140
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,480
which is the phase between the true away from this point and that point two

141
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:15,130
neighbouring points and here are thousands of these only between the two neighbouring sources

142
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,220
so first we want to know

143
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,970
how many times

144
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,410
can we fit wavelength on this path

145
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,420
and for each time that we can

146
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,150
wavelengths on their

147
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,280
we have a case different parts of the delta

148
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,670
is the phase difference and we had the same equation last time for obviously no

149
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,310
and if this delta is the multiple times two pi

150
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,350
then you will

151
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:41,950
i have

152
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,000
constructive interference michael today is way more ambitious i want to know what the light

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,530
intensities for any angle theta

154
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,590
have been extremely cool headed from

155
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,880
i first want to revisit some of your high school geometry

156
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,350
if you ever triangles

157
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,090
and this site is a

158
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,350
and this site is also a

159
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,530
the length of the triangle

160
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,950
the length of the sides

161
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,780
and if you want to know

162
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,690
what this one is

163
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,630
and if this angle is delta

164
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,100
on this side here

165
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,590
two a

166
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,780
the cosine

167
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,400
one that

168
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:29,470
we can revisit that your high school geometry but i need that today

169
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,950
and now i'm going to

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
due to superposition in vectorial superposition of capital and

171
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,820
he vector

172
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,660
that come from these various sources and the neighbouring ones

173
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,720
i doubt that's the phase angle between

174
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,410
i would

175
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,170
raise later but i'll first one

176
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,850
we're about to see what i do

177
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,230
i start with a

178
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,610
a circle

179
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,860
you will see shortly why i do that

180
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,720
radius of the circle is unimportant you'll see that

181
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:12,790
will cancel

182
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,470
so this radius

183
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,540
arbitrarily chosen

184
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,930
these are

185
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,280
this line here

186
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,730
it's also are

187
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,450
all these points seem

188
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,890
this point o

189
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,110
and this point p

190
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,660
and i'm going to

191
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,560
at three factors which are all set relative to each other over an angle about

192
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,700
that but i will make the calculation is if they were capital and

193
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,580
capital and could be a million

194
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,470
but i'm going to make the drawing only for three

195
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,920
this is one factor

196
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,510
that's a thousand ninety eight really the electric vector that's going to be

197
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,720
and in fact relate to the unelected vectors

198
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,980
so here's is the other

199
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,100
the second one

200
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,170
here is the third one

201
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,120
so the angle between

202
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,900
the second and the third one

203
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,280
this angle here

204
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,930
is delta

205
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,810
and this angle here

206
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,420
it's also delta

207
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:23,600
that's the delta between the neighbouring sources which we just right

208
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,870
it follows from the geometry of circle

209
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,780
this angle here is well

210
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,480
this angle here as

211
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,200
and this angle the also the

212
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,660
what that means

213
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,790
if i have capital and of these vectors

214
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,930
that this angle here

215
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,640
is then and times delta

216
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,990
and that means

217
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:54,650
of the sky taken with five or six for LSST  I think it's twelve different filters

218
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:02,230
different passbands and rather than a continuum of a spectra you get snapshots at

219
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:10,330
different passbands so it's a crude spectrum is this crude spectrum good enough to use to

220
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:19,010
get information about supernovae this is something that is not known yet it's it's a

221
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:26,990
it's a subject of ongoing research s s let me turn  now to baryon acoustic oscillations and

222
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:33,150
how we get information from baryon acoustic oscillations about dark energy again we have

223
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:39,890
talked about recombination I think in every lecture before recombination the universe was ionized the

224
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:47,610
photons provided enormous pressure and restoring force and perturbations were frozen they just oscillated like sound

225
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:53,970
waves after recombination the universe was neutral the photons travelled freely they were decoupled

226
00:12:53,970 --> 00:13:00,010
from the baryons and perturbations grew so it's very easy to know what happened

227
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,470
in the tightly coupled limit and in the decoupled limit but this is a very interesting

228
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,880
and I wanna turn again to this movie that I've shown a couple of

229
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,190
times in these lectures this movie from Dan Eisenstein showing the evolution of dark

230
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:22,530
matter in black gas in blue photons in red and neutrinos in green so this is

231
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,950
movie showing what would happen to a density peak so you gather up

232
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:34,190
dark matter gas photons and neutrinos and make a density peak a very small one and then how

233
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:42,610
that spreads out over time the dark matter has if it's cold has no velocity

234
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:49,670
or very small velocity so it's just going to stay there the photons are going

235
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:55,390
to want to stream out of this over densit region however if the photons are

236
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:01,370
coupled tightly coupled to gas it can't stream out until the universe starts to go

237
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,970
through recombination so don't worry about the neutrinos the important thing to look here is

238
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,970
what happens to the gas and the photons so the ga the photons are going

239
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:17,590
to start to stream out but they're going to drag the baryons along and

240
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,430
then recombination will occur the baryons will stay behind and the photons

241
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:27,490
will continue propagating I just love this movie there's a lot of physics there so

242
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:33,690
there you see the gas and photons coupled then about three hundred thousand years every

243
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:39,830
combination occurs the pho the baryons are left behind  and the photons travel to us

244
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,840
the baryons are left behind in a little bump there the dark matter falls

245
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,470
into the baryon potential wells here the baryons fall into the dark matter potential

246
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,270
wells there and you end up with a power spectrum that has a memory

247
00:14:54,270 --> 00:15:00,290
of the initial perturbation but there's a feature on the power spectrum a feature in

248
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:07,970
the inhomogeneity of the universe at a distance scale of about a hundred and fifty megaparsec so the

249
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:17,610
photons drag the baryons out to a hundred and fifty megaparsec so each overdense region is an overpressure that

250
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:23,610
launched a spherical sound wave the wave travelled outward with C over the square root of three

251
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:31,170
then the photons decouple travel to us observable is the CMB peaks then the sound

252
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:37,450
speed plummeted the sound speed of the wave plummeted because there was no pressure and

253
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:44,460
the wave stalled and the total distance travelled by this bunch of baryons was a

254
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,620
hundred and fifty  megaparsec so there's a bunch of baryons at a distance scale of a hundred and fifty

255
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:55,650
megaparsec that dark matter and they'll be a feature in the power spectrum

256
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:01,710
of density perturbations at a hundred and fifty megaparsec and that was first hints of this

257
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:07,870
were fir st seen in the two degree field survey and it was I believe convincingly

258
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,450
demonstrated by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey so this is a data from the Sloan

259
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:19,650
Digital Sky Survey  and here you see the feature of the acoustic peak so

260
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:26,830
there is  the I feature in the universe in the distribution of matter on a distance scale

261
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:37,870
of a hundred and fifty megaparsec and the exact size of this depends upon omega matter omega baryon cosmological

262
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:45,710
parameters but they are determined by the microwave background radiation because it's this the same parameters

263
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:54,690
enter in determining the position of this peak which is accurately determined now the feature

264
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:00,150
is a small effect because it's do originally to the baryons  and we know

265
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:06,570
that the baryons contribute only a small fraction of the total mass density so

266
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:10,810
there's a feature out there and let's make it simple here's a typical observer looking at this

267
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:16,470
feature that's a  hundred and  fifteem sper  spherical feature that's a hundred and fifty  megaparsec in this direction in that

268
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,730
direction  of course it's nevers  one feature you look at you look at

269
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:27,030
the statistical ensemble  but you can if you know this distance you can

270
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:35,210
measure the angular diameter and dark energy enters through the angular diameter distance relationship you

271
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,530
can also measure  by measuring the distance and the redshift the difference in the redshift in

272
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:46,630
the front of the feature and the back of the feature H here so dark

273
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:52,050
energy enters through D A and H and we can get information on dark energy from

274
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:59,330
baryon acoustic oscillations there is a tremendous virtue  on this technique it that it's

275
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:08,430
just geometry it's free of many of the systematic effects that are in other methods

276
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:17,410
so you don't have to worry about magnetic fields evolution metallicity reddening it's just geometry there

277
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,890
are problems to this technique one problem is that the amplitude is small so you

278
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:29,630
have to require you require large-scales and huge volumes you have to look at thousands

279
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:37,030
of hundred and fifty megaparsec cube volumes if you're looking at many many many objects perhaps

280
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:42,130
the ultimate is we'll be using photometric redshifts and we don't know how well that

281
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:48,250
works there's also an issue that there are nonlinear facts in the evolution

282
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,830
and you want to see anything

283
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,180
the naked eye that looks like anything has happened

284
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,660
in between you wanted the piston moving the gases turbulent

285
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,380
the pressure to find some reason law in some regions then it's stuff

286
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,910
this is the notion of systems in equilibrium

287
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,030
and in between the stage

288
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,940
the system which are not in equilibrium

289
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,290
but the system is in such equilibrium

290
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,540
we can assign to the temperature

291
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,250
that we call p

292
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,670
right now we don't know anything about this step has to be going to build

293
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:28,490
it up from scratch rather than your instinctive feeling for what happened to this

294
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,350
one of the loss of the more dynamic scholars zeroth law

295
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,010
is it a lot because they wrote on the first law

296
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,160
and they went back and had an idea what is even more profound

297
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,540
and they so we call it

298
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,390
zero line

299
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,780
zero total losses

300
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,730
if a and b are the same temperature

301
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,110
in b and c are the same temperature

302
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,510
in a and c are the same temperature

303
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,730
i see

304
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,040
this believe

305
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:00,140
the audience when called the and i think that is the key to i would

306
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,270
being able to speak about temperature globally is the assumption that the fact that the

307
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,170
monitor measure something there

308
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,430
they come back in the thermometer here

309
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,440
and agreed to same number then i may conclude these two entities which never made

310
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,590
it to the directly are also the same template

311
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,690
it's not

312
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,340
that seems pretty obvious to you but that is

313
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,940
the whole lotta countries is predicated on the fact that you can define an attribute

314
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,320
called temperature

315
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:30,140
that can be globally compared between two systems that never met directly but met the

316
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,740
third system

317
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,790
so once we hate once we have some idea of hot and cold

318
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,720
it was decided not to be more quantity

319
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:44,840
it's like saying you somebody solid shot is not enough we go into how tall

320
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,490
harmony harmony society millimeters

321
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,400
so we want to get quantity

322
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,070
all we have right now is notion of hot and cold

323
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,040
so what we try to do

324
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,970
is to find some way

325
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,380
to be more precise about how hard and how cool

326
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,790
what people said is

327
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,430
let's look at some things in the world that seem to depend on temperature

328
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,530
one thing that seems to depend on temperature is the following

329
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,830
you take this stick

330
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,070
the national bureau of standards kept some glass case at some temperature

331
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,010
you pull it out

332
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:22,390
make duplicate effort put it outside leaving the rule

333
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,810
what you may find this in the room was harder than the glass case

334
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,610
this rather than expand

335
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,080
two a new like

336
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:33,850
one runs outside the case when drug inside the case so the comparison is meaningful

337
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,380
nothing has been done this guy

338
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,550
in the condition glass case but this one is expanding

339
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,610
so one way to define temperature is to simply ask

340
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,120
how long is this rock and somehow

341
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,010
currently the length of the rod

342
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,670
with temperature by some fashion

343
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,730
so you can do that so what you need to do that what you need

344
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,710
to do first is to define

345
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,360
but some markings on it so that for needs extra something grows we get to

346
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,400
the temperature has gone up by some amount

347
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,650
so then we need units for temperature that's completely arbitrary

348
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,240
and you need some standards

349
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,880
this leads me to speak to you know not

350
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,070
at the intrinsic nature water meter we just made it up and so let's call

351
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,680
them either

352
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,870
in the case of the media the zero applies

353
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,660
if you bring me to stick next to mine and we agree

354
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,940
you can take the me to stick somewhere else

355
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,910
and find that to be the mean

356
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,610
because of the stickers as long as that one and this long is that one

357
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,540
of those two equal in length

358
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,820
the temperature you similarly going to use the rod

359
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,430
and say this rather settling and then kept on top of this bucket of some

360
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,760
and the same length but to keep it on that bucket

361
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,970
then the two buckets at the same temperature

362
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,220
so we can use

363
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,540
on this rock compared to the

364
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,760
on expander like this to measure of temperature

365
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,770
so what people do is to pick

366
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,590
something a little easier than this right

367
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,130
in know the liquid expands

368
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,550
when you heat that's why you know somebody if you your gas tank

369
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,920
you have to leave some room at the top

370
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,420
overflow can come out of the time

371
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,190
you should fill it completely

372
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,500
otherwise it first attack

373
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,070
so liquids expand

374
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,300
so one way to measure temperature maybe

375
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,870
take some liquid

376
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:23,740
put it there

377
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,490
and then

378
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:32,680
put it on hard rules and maybe what's the liquid expands the new high

379
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,720
and thence across the markings

380
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,450
need marking can be a certain temperature

381
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,980
but people have a better idea than this one

382
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,770
they have the following idea thermometer where

383
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,670
you have a lot of fluid in the reservoir

384
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,700
a very thin tubes

385
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,560
back way to the top

386
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,940
the fluid then

387
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,280
this year

388
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,310
so what's clever about this

389
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,550
is that

390
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,110
this expands by one percent year i should be good enough to see one percent

391
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,210
increase in

392
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,270
this fluid expands one percent in volume

393
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:13,170
that one person in volume in the planes of this nanotubes can play quite a

394
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,050
because the extra volume you get by expansion

395
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,910
it will be the eighty of the stu

396
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,380
times the extra delta x we would expect

397
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:28,580
your magnifying the expansion by making all the expander fluid climate is extremely narrow two

398
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,480
in fact the tube so narrow

399
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,620
you cannot probably even see well which is why there no prison that magnifies the

400
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,000
the mercurial alcoholism on

401
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,890
OK so we have some

402
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,020
we're falling temperature

403
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,550
we can draw some lines arbitrary doesn't matter that can be zero that can be

404
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:52,430
applied in nineteen is going to make sure is monotonic

405
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,640
then whenever

406
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:59,000
it's on twenty one b argue that twenty one is now part of the ninety

407
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,470
what you want to better skilled than that even though that's mathematically adequate in practice

408
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,960
what people decide

409
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,460
it is to do it as follows

410
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,240
this be one is that the thermometer so that people all over the world in

411
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,730
different parts of the world different countries different labs can all agree

412
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:18,060
so we will make it possible for everyone to make their own thermometers

413
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,050
by the following recipe

414
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,970
we will that this guy

415
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,070
in a bucket

416
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,970
it has got some i sent some water

417
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,830
called the melting point of water

418
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,680
so that

419
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,970
of the freezing point of water a melting point of ice to the freezing point

420
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,180
of water doesn't matter

421
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,070
we notice that as water cools down the world and suddenly i see he was

422
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,210
begin to form we go to the temperature at which that happens for the first

423
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,250
and we the the moment there

424
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,600
and what they were reading we get we will possibly to be

425
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,430
zero degrees centigrade

426
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,750
that is just a definition

427
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,320
we believe that's a good definition because people all over the world

428
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,010
you can do that cause if you live in kuwait

429
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,530
it's not going to work for the noise

430
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,670
but the

431
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,560
figure out when part the world when you had to use this is very good

432
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,480
you get eyes

433
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,000
you've got zero degrees

434
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,140
they said let's find another

435
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,100
accessible thing which as you all know is the boiling point of water

436
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,060
to put water on the stove which heats up and he his up and suddenly

437
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,740
begins to bubble and boiling evaporate

438
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,540
the that temperature is going to be called a hundred degrees

439
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,630
he is also the internal point here that kind of

440
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,090
it up here

441
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,600
now that i've done this this is this is so i know how each of

442
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,700
these individual points match so when actually updating still altarpiece on updating the individual points

443
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,800
this sixty point some not worrying about the mesh at all

444
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,030
the mesh is very important when when i'm doing the

445
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,080
the model synthesis but it's also very important when i'm doing in this composition

446
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,460
because what i can do

447
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,540
is i i will the piecewise mesh is not composed but each of the individual

448
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,610
triangles inside the mesh for

449
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,330
so what i can do is i can work out how what's find what between

450
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,740
here and here

451
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,650
delta p one

452
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,740
i want to find what

453
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,250
between here and here

454
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,540
delta p two

455
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,460
so and so forth

456
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,210
what i did then

457
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,940
to p three

458
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,360
each of the triangles

459
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,060
and what amount to do then is that i can

460
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:36,130
in terms of the source image so source image here

461
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,190
so the source images or larger

462
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,120
and this is my current guess

463
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,550
where where the triangle of with a with the triangular meshes inside the image so

464
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,660
this is my update with respect to the template and now i want to try

465
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,410
and apply this update two

466
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,650
the source image here

467
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,790
so what i what ends up happening

468
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,900
is that

469
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,960
i have a shift so i say actually apply

470
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,500
delta p one inverse here

471
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,400
delta p

472
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,000
three inverse here

473
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,310
delta p

474
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,250
two invest here so i do that

475
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,290
and i might end up

476
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,560
with this

477
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:23,450
that's the problem

478
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,260
when i invest close

479
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,820
i lose the thickness of all the points so so everything is not connected so

480
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,690
what i then after the approximation is is what i then do

481
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,700
it is i just take the average of all these things

482
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,870
and assume that this is one point seven here take the average of these two

483
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,850
points is one point here

484
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,460
the average here

485
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,170
and here

486
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,060
so mathematically

487
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,000
for the piece was the final it's not technically correct but the inverse copied this

488
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,790
sort the trick this approximate three tends to work very well and that and that's

489
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,290
what we so we actually do the inverse composition

490
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,750
on the actual triangles in the mesh

491
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,190
and then run reconstructed

492
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,750
that's a little bit too much detail but that's that's that's that's how we do

493
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,550
and so this is an example

494
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:20,040
another example of a running this was this is this super souped-up fast whatever so

495
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:20,960
they used

496
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,350
everything in the book to try and speed this up and

497
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,780
the nice thing here is that the go back tracking and also

498
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,850
this is the reason recent pieces of the phi space purely on the i competitions

499
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,760
and you can kind of see that it's actually rather than regular iron which is

500
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,000
kind of blocking does a bad job sometimes of representing different shapes and expressions because

501
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,740
with the coupling shape and appearance separately we actually a really good job of synthesizing

502
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,760
the facts so this is purely synthesized just from the linear model of appearance and

503
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,950
same here in the black

504
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,900
and yet we spoke about the high speed and then you can you might be

505
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,730
asking well

506
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,620
and this is an argument that kind of

507
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,960
so many in like a bit more on common not so hard but what i

508
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,790
say that the inverse composition makes it useful

509
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,880
is that if an editor it's a two hundred frames per second i could perhaps

510
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,540
have because this is the gradient descent top approach i could perhaps have ten different

511
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:28,280
within within the frame within within the frame of trying to align the facts so

512
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,530
it kind of talking about solar project how perhaps doesn't always work well but if

513
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,870
i do it fast enough i could have saved

514
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,990
ten different ten different tries to trying to get alignment

515
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,090
and so

516
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,700
this is this is kind of an argument for the two but i still like

517
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,250
to think that

518
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:50,030
i'm not a big fan site because it still tends to file sometimes the project

519
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,640
find you know

520
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,490
so we use

521
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,370
i don't know

522
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,850
the same time

523
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,850
that's what i think

524
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,680
you know why

525
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,260
in core

526
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,120
and this is very dangerous

527
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,910
at the moment

528
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,660
we can

529
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,760
so the

530
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,820
the document

531
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,820
they just happen

532
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,490
he has this

533
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,950
two one two

534
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,450
we call on

535
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,780
so that here

536
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,300
in the first place

537
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,820
you have to this is not

538
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:07,140
there's also these two put emphasis on what was the time

539
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,140
the station

540
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,930
so that's the

541
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,700
the weighting scheme of news

542
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,970
we can see a number of problems because

543
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,240
and you can

544
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:34,760
none of the world because of what we have

545
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,890
as you go away

546
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,510
effectively used

547
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,160
it was

548
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,370
you get

549
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,590
i think is full

550
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:53,590
talk critical

551
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,760
it's three

552
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:03,760
and the what she wants it is representation of

553
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,910
i think still not as far as

554
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,490
right to make it when your

555
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,320
you do

556
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,910
i really

557
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:37,330
so i think it's time to

558
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:40,510
well we talk about it

559
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:48,220
looking at with this idea

560
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:57,450
hi you have to present you have to

561
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,260
o thing

562
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,720
rules all

563
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,050
were you to think this is you all

564
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,320
so think

565
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,720
if there is if you want

566
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,280
forty seven or

567
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,330
we already

568
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,200
the idea

569
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,700
let me

570
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,450
so feature

571
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,600
is that

572
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,680
also in things like

573
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:48,280
i can see from six to five

574
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,430
you were

575
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,640
this is a region where the

576
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,280
she has subsequently

577
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,120
in the sequence

578
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:07,950
the reason for this sequence and use doesn't necessarily have to be used

579
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,680
in the use

580
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,620
the particular

581
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:21,990
one who is going to whatever it is nice to get the final

582
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,700
two hundred is always true

583
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,720
that each

584
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,930
we should

585
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:48,070
so this is not

586
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,010
example you know what we we have

587
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,930
this is looking at all

588
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:00,070
two two CA

589
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,260
please see

590
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:11,100
o two which is where

591
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,470
slightly more white

592
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,410
down by the

593
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:21,660
we to this is a so when

594
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,970
q such that we have to

595
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,280
he is going to do this

596
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,120
this is

597
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,640
she was the one that

598
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:51,720
imagine we find that if i can't just fall

599
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,320
in part three

600
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,780
that for

601
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,910
well thanks to

602
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:07,000
class being suitably rich

603
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,520
OK so

604
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,650
if found

605
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:18,330
if the infimum over as as n gets large we like you know the infimum

606
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:22,320
the union of these things so the overall of f of the of the virus

607
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,980
should be equal to the be the optimal fire

608
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,150
OK so this is just the dense this property for

609
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:34,660
we wanted to be to be similar which what the span in adaboost case span

610
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,540
this class of functions

611
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,030
to to

612
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,730
approximate the

613
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,120
the optimal

614
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,540
as accurately as we like

615
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:51,880
so that would take care of the approximation error term and you know i'm not

616
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,510
going to go into any details there there are there are simple

617
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,760
there are many examples where this is the case

618
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:05,300
right where where the approximation error term is asymptotically zero in the

619
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,530
reproducing kernel hilbert space

620
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:12,140
setting for instance all the euclidean space the gas in kernel has the property that

621
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,620
the you know the the RKHS

622
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,730
can can always give you for any probability distribution can give you the optimal fire

623
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,230
so it's universal in that sense

624
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:29,550
in finite dimensional girls don't have polynomial kernel trick

625
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,850
the other

626
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,580
two to ensure that the other terms

627
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,910
goes to zero

628
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,880
we need to

629
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:49,130
to worry about the regularisation either through the choice of of this this hierarchy fn

630
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,090
right by

631
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,610
the the well defined only if ten was

632
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,450
we weren't using these

633
00:39:54,470 --> 00:40:02,840
these classes to grow suitably slowly or through the the explicit regularisation right so the

634
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,200
the regularisation term needs to go to zero

635
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:11,570
so that we do exercise the full classes but it should go to zero suitably

636
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,150
slowly so this term

637
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,280
the estimation error term goes to zero and then

638
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,340
under these two conditions then we can hope to have the fire escape approaching

639
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,550
the optimal fire stuff i start these two terms are going to both go to

640
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,110
zero and you know and when when the

641
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:38,990
phi is classification calibrated then we'll get some sort of consistency result right

642
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,990
but the risk actually approaches the bayes risk

643
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,840
which is the nice thing is the first thing that you might the first to

644
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,320
guarantee that you might want to have a better method of this

645
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,900
this kind

646
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,590
OK and the course

647
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:57,650
you might also be concerned with with rates

648
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,470
you might also be concerned with with help

649
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:03,150
rapidly the risk approaches the

650
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,840
the optimal bayes risk

651
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,110
i was a little bit about

652
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,360
about that

653
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:20,380
and about getting some kind of an oracle inequality i'm gonna skip now from

654
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:26,150
from talking about excess risk to talking just about to fire OK so let's let's

655
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,990
you keep in mind that we have this relationship between the two

656
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,010
focus on just the excess risk of a and c are rapidly that goes to

657
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,550
zero so

658
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,240
you know we will ignore this

659
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,920
side related to the quality really care about the the excess risk

660
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,800
OK so

661
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,180
let's think now

662
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,550
about a regularisation kind of approach that involves some sort of penalty

663
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,530
OK so once again i'm splitting things up into a hierarchy

664
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,740
if f one f two and so on

665
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,110
and i'm considering within each class k if k

666
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:14,440
and defining OK and is the minimiser of

667
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,280
they are the

668
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,440
which his words

669
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,930
provides a means to construct

670
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:23,070
from twenty five thirty sounds

671
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,470
that's the expressions

672
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,120
that enable us to

673
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,550
reveal everything everything

674
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,970
all movements all

675
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,850
right characterization rare

676
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,220
recognition using

677
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,110
on the

678
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,410
characters language

679
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,510
he said much

680
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,000
so really

681
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,750
created pair

682
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,300
normal use

683
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:50,630
and was

684
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:56,820
core features these ants you've lost

685
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,330
coming recently

686
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,510
a century ago prominently

687
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,060
raise question

688
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,340
how the elements of language

689
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,610
come into existence my speed

690
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,940
on the basis of his

691
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:19,560
from the position

692
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,070
and that's processes

693
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,620
in the solution

694
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,410
you've somehow

695
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,160
structure the

696
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,150
is definitely not

697
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,900
inference the

698
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,230
free expressions

699
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,770
there are typically the space

700
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,360
o that's

701
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,950
and it therefore follows that you test sounds like

702
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,490
it discovers evolutionary

703
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:53,220
his on

704
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,990
two hundred yes she calls

705
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,720
the very principles

706
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,600
underlying the original languages

707
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,710
the game u

708
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,020
so it make

709
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,740
these are ideas that

710
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,230
it was a strange day

711
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,510
then they

712
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,650
it it science here that

713
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,650
came dominate the field

714
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,260
then marginalize the destinations

715
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,440
in science fact this for years

716
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,850
he was same starting

717
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:45,670
six years

718
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,500
poking around like

719
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,350
and along with

720
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,720
this all the

721
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,350
behavioral science

722
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:07,160
well reformulating as

723
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,210
program which is right

724
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,480
the basic task is

725
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:12,940
to be

726
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,600
true nature interfaces true

727
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:19,820
so pragmatic

728
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:30,560
the for

729
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,820
should actually be

730
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,880
free expressions

731
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:41,200
along with questions

732
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:45,920
the solution

733
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,500
generally have

734
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,150
it is what

735
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,400
which is that he

736
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:01,450
the major is simple

737
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,280
it used to be easiest and simplest

738
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,220
and the test centers

739
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:10,500
then is to try to

740
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,910
and fact is full is possible

741
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,470
and should be

742
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:18,700
right in the

743
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,050
the is superficial

744
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,120
the station

745
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,740
these principles we

746
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:26,960
so the

747
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,450
this is

748
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,010
john is

749
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,020
the largest city

750
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,460
the central are science

751
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,870
it's actually

752
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,410
complex also the symbols in the world

753
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,700
find useful i

754
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,990
the task is to determine

755
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,380
how closely

756
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,950
language approximates well all know

757
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,750
refers to the

758
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:08,120
do any boundary conditions

759
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,700
what we can show is that you can really express this

760
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:18,940
the sum of the variances discarded columns so you want to minimize the sum of the variances

761
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,940
the discarded columns yeah

762
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,550
so that makes sense actually when you think about it

763
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,540
it also shows that this is a very interesting algorithm

764
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,360
so actually go much further

765
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,910
the algorithm is saying

766
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,270
the in order to match those distances in the best way

767
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:41,970
i should extract

768
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,640
the dimensions which have the largest variance

769
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:52,210
what is i mean rotated six it kinda makes sense because it means by rotated

770
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:55,630
six it will be the columns they're turning on and off in terms of pixels

771
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:56,120
the most

772
00:47:56,550 --> 00:48:00,260
yeah so if there is a wide will be white columns which just stay why

773
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,010
because no pixel-level lands on a new discarding those

774
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,390
and we're retaining

775
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:10,200
pixels from representation where the variance is largest as it spins around

776
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:13,520
okay so let's do not

777
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,750
this is a two-dimensional visualization

778
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,100
this is now

779
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:21,800
the distances in latent space using the algorithm

780
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,610
okay what she is

781
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:25,490
not very good representation

782
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,520
you can see that these guys are completely similar completely severed completely similar

783
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,790
annotates triumph approximating what we saw on

784
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:37,700
in the diagonal yeah

785
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,610
but you can't see any serious features

786
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,830
and the mean absolute error is point two one five quite large

787
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,090
this is ten dimensions okay

788
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:54,960
hey you couldn't even see the similarity between all three sixty hey you can

789
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:58,220
stop trying to merge so this is like

790
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,030
ten pixels about data

791
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:02,940
so this discussion you do want to retain

792
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,040
quite a lot of your data you don't i throw away

793
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,740
all the ten pixels

794
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:10,060
but a hundred dimensions

795
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,700
small a mean absolute error

796
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:16,110
not all features item at a thousand dimensions

797
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,240
now we're really starting to see something with scientists e

798
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:23,990
on structure hear with those squares yeah

799
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,130
we're seeing

800
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:29,450
i mean this this band isn't quite tight enough that's pretty good approximation

801
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:36,380
so great job with reduce the dimensionality from three thousand six hundred forty eight dimensions two thousand and

802
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,290
not really very good

803
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,350
so this type of algorithm is not gonna work but there's a nice reason for

804
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:44,790
introducing it because there's a trick

805
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:49,180
what are we doing here when preserving interpoint distances

806
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,060
we are actually

807
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,420
taking a data set like this and this the two dimensional data set we want

808
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:00,410
to preserve interpoint distances in this two-dimensional dataset

809
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,310
we're projecting

810
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,910
the largest variance dimension on

811
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:06,470
x axis

812
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,120
and that's a reduced dimensional representation

813
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:10,360
yeah fair enough

814
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:19,100
but you can rotate the data set and preserve all interpoint distances so as far as our algorithm is concerned

815
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:23,390
a rotation and this data not an image rotation

816
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:25,530
but rotation of the actual

817
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,880
um vector space

818
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:32,520
in terms of like multiply why by a rotation matrix

819
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,470
doing this

820
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:36,980
doesn't actually affect

821
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,090
interpoint distance matrices at all

822
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,960
so if replace rotation

823
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,400
now what happens

824
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,740
now we project onto the x axis

825
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,740
we've got a much better representation about data

826
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,280
so what is that's

827
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:53,920
that's says the

828
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:58,470
why don't we insert just selecting columns why don't we rotate

829
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:00,430
the data set

830
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,640
once we rotated the data set

831
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:04,480
throw away

832
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,270
the columns the rotated data set with the smallest variance

833
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,430
yeah retain only those with the largest variance

834
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:14,810
so this algorithm is saying rotate dataset

835
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,230
and retain

836
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,320
the columns from x with the largest variance

837
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,950
here's what happens if possible that have little or

838
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:27,450
but happy

839
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:29,420
let's have a look at how

840
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:33,310
we can do about because it should be also does anyone know

841
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,770
what operation

842
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:43,780
you applied to data set

843
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,740
in order to find the rotation

844
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,460
which leads you which is in the direction of maximum variance

845
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,580
piece e eight

846
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:54,490
principal component analysis

847
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,130
this what person similar

848
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:02,960
it's useful to actually go through this go through this exercise due to the in

849
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,960
a different order and see what happens to the graph

850
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:11,020
what sort of key here you want to be very clear about this is when

851
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,150
you some

852
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:16,590
you end up modifying terms this term changed a bit because of the effect of

853
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:19,340
something this out

854
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,190
right and it it changed bit what's important is that there already was a potential

855
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:24,940
term sitting there

856
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:30,270
it got tweaked a little changed but i didn't add any new potential term nothing

857
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:34,790
new was added this changed this useful to think about what if you some to

858
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,360
the south

859
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,960
think about doing it here what effect would that have on the coupling of the

860
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:45,790
well go into details now but that's that's useful to think about the break the

861
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,310
order in which i did this matters a lot

862
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,090
i was nice to unite shows the good order

863
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:56,880
roughly speaking you can sort of see i was essentially moving outside to in i

864
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,630
was starting the the outside sixteen i got the five and i sort of collapse

865
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:02,000
the graph in word

866
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:06,340
but you can do this elimination in any ordering you want

867
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:11,440
but not order not all orderings are equal some orderings are much better than others

868
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,750
so this is an optimal ordering

869
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:15,900
some orderings can be very bad

870
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,670
so it's useful to play with this example just a little bit on your own

871
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:26,440
to understand why the order in which you do this might matter

872
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,050
right so the sort of summary years

873
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:34,400
the basic step is is very simple we're just distributing sum and product to do

874
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,650
partial some asians in some order

875
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:40,920
so you're fixing an elimination ordering in using distributive law as much as you can

876
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,130
without order

877
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:48,190
what sort of key graphically is that the minute you some over a particular variable

878
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:52,000
you get to eliminate that node and its edges from the graph

879
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,840
that's a good thing that makes you happy the graph is shrinking

880
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,540
but the bad thing that you have to be careful about you have to join

881
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,940
all of its neighbors

882
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,090
with extra edges

883
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,920
so as you join these extra edges

884
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:10,360
for instance one example of where this happened was right here

885
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,920
i didn't have an edge here initially

886
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:16,290
but once i sum over the x four at this point

887
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,920
it's going to be an edge that's added here you can see that it has

888
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,750
to be added because you get a new coupling term

889
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:25,730
and i'm doing that's going to start making your graph more and more connected it's

890
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,150
can actually increase

891
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:34,210
the size of the clique series making actually three clique there that didn't exist before

892
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:40,190
so what it turns out is if you do a bit of algebra to figure

893
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:42,710
out how much did you pay to do all this

894
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:46,960
at the end of the day how much to pay depends very much on how

895
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,320
big the cliques got in this new graph that gets created as you sort of

896
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,310
shrink the graph down

897
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,520
what sort of matters how many edges you have to add as you were eliminated

898
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:02,340
so here i ended up having to actually create a new three clique

899
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,290
only had three clique here but the biggest click that i would have gotten in

900
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:10,170
this graph is actually three clique there's nothing bigger than that there's no four cliques

901
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:16,500
if you choose define elimination ordering you'll see that you will get four clique

902
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,650
so the key thing is that elimination ordering matters a lot

903
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:22,610
there are good orderings and bad ones

904
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:28,710
unfortunately the figure out which is the optimal ordering that's not an easy problem

905
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:32,630
it's actually an NP hard problem in general

906
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:38,230
practically speaking there are a lot of heuristics to find reasonable orderings you might not

907
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:42,020
find the best one but you can certainly find reasonable ones

908
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:50,070
so that's that's elimination algorithm the intuition you want to take away from this is

909
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:56,000
that there is a really nice correspondence between analytically and you sort of manipulating the

910
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,190
or the y axis

911
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:05,230
in the generative frame assassination

912
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:10,100
i mean so if you have the assassination

913
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,310
abraham lincoln

914
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:15,370
i don't know

915
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:18,060
assassination of

916
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:21,730
the noun itself is indicated with now

917
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,710
the thing in the gender

918
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:32,190
it the that's so

919
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,890
these destination of a link

920
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,100
if we can be

921
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:42,130
the victim of this assassination of that

922
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:48,900
so you you could also

923
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,850
five relational nouns like mother

924
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,580
with this kind of

925
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:56,190
template translation

926
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:03,120
verbsemtrans is the prototypical example of these kinds of some transform

927
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:06,750
so here two random example verbsemtrans

928
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:11,420
the word scratches were

929
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:14,040
as it were

930
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,650
the the intransitive verb

931
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:19,670
no action which

932
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,940
which is scratching sound

933
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,940
chance crashed i guess that means

934
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:29,120
anyway that's what this is

935
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:36,080
it was related to the

936
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:39,100
subject of the

937
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:43,120
to the role primary objects moving

938
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:47,130
and i should think about what said

939
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:51,400
in the transitive friend have not only subject

940
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,710
that but also

941
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,690
the action is

942
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:00,170
scratching one's actions keyword

943
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,770
that corresponds to what the

944
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,560
for the first

945
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:07,900
object is

946
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,040
related to the action and its object is to change

947
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,250
and we have

948
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:15,000
the subject

949
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,370
is related to the action being done by

950
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,690
one so

951
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:29,480
you could

952
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:33,520
derived verbsemtrans entries from

953
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,560
from the

954
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:41,890
the other

955
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,350
a collection

956
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:45,650
potentially so give

957
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,920
you know you could say OK

958
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,350
i know that this

959
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,130
kind of actions

960
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,750
is a single participant action

961
00:58:56,330 --> 00:59:00,020
it should correspond to infer that is intransitive

962
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:04,440
and nothing prevents you from inferring that

963
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,690
you can also these verbsemtrans entries

964
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:09,600
by hand

965
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:19,330
oh yes there yes some very good point

966
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:24,480
the show to better i think somebody was

967
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,100
not paying attention when they made

968
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:33,190
yes actually unfortunately copy pasted that from KB but

969
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:41,770
yes i did read but i think it's wrong

970
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,080
i think that's

971
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:45,000
good observation

972
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:51,290
maybe that's what they have in mind

973
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:53,330
transitive and reflexive

974
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:54,690
yes OK

975
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:55,770
i take it back

976
00:59:55,790 --> 01:00:04,730
i'm sorry to whoever wrote that in the next lecture

977
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:11,750
there's sort of a shortcut for writing verbsemtrans entries that are canonical

978
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,940
the kinds of cases that you

979
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,710
right across often so regular transitive verb

980
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,210
have very

981
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,230
you can just use of assumptions not

982
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,290
this one says the word assassinate

983
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,480
the transitive verb means

984
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,710
denotes an event assassinatingsomeone and

985
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:44,890
subject is the perpetrator and the object is at the

986
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:50,350
right so far extremely notation so intense and

987
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:52,330
i'll go over gentemplate

988
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:58,720
of of

989
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:01,370
they well

990
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:24,840
who was

991
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:28,980
o o

992
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:46,580
this is the

993
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:18,180
in the first

994
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:28,370
so all all

995
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:57,390
it's all

996
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:17,770
so yes

997
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,980
this is hard

998
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:29,170
you a

999
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:48,670
this one

1000
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,180
the better

1001
01:04:56,230 --> 01:05:00,860
for this

1002
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:10,040
we're going to

1003
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:11,820
the situation where you

1004
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:27,580
first we need to

1005
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,670
was published

1006
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:34,250
four b

1007
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:38,010
two b and c and d were only three b

1008
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:42,670
and this has happened according and you can prove that if you are using

1009
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:49,240
for the concord every every every character

1010
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:54,410
i have according to be dubious the bias for the distribution

1011
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,640
by the way

1012
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:01,390
we can go not from down to topic and do it from top to down

1013
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:06,390
we can divide simply some them and divided into two into port in two parts

1014
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:09,940
with the same probability characters

1015
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,110
from bottom to top we can do from top to bottom

1016
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:20,730
how we call this called if somebody who is about information theory

1017
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,660
if it if the building from bottom to top

1018
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:24,960
this is

1019
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:31,480
happen because if the building from top to bottom how because such code

1020
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:37,650
because sharon was the guy who viewed all this area

1021
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:43,770
i created this calls what he was not very right about average and so his

1022
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:46,540
first idea was viewed from top to bottom

1023
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:51,360
and there are some bond cases like such called is not optimal

1024
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:53,960
so very good

1025
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:58,360
so we can encode every day but the problem with this recording is pretty good

1026
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:00,810
we can we can

1027
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:02,800
compress out text

1028
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,470
model is very very simple

1029
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:08,930
if you're talking about this

1030
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:10,920
first square compression models

1031
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:16,770
with the competition model was simply that for this character have this probability that's it

1032
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:18,680
nothing more

1033
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,920
and you know that not true for a language because we have different probabilities for

1034
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:28,260
what but also you know that we have a lot of repetitions in in every

1035
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:31,960
string have made a lot of common

1036
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,300
and this simple model doesn't work for

1037
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:41,250
so what we can do can do the this is samples find actually this example

1038
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:45,230
eleven pose even according

1039
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,050
ln pose seventy eight

1040
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:51,330
it's pretty simple type of encoding but it

1041
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:54,440
very fast especially during decompression

1042
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:58,520
and if you're going to use tax and you don't need random access so you

1043
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,200
always the text from beginning to end

1044
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:05,630
on the morning computers it's so we want to keep text compressed

1045
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:08,390
because the compression

1046
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:14,650
four because the compression data is also very simple let's add to all of about

1047
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,250
one additional

1048
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:19,090
one additional thing

1049
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:22,730
and this is case that says that

1050
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,090
a group of characters

1051
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,530
the same characters as

1052
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,450
before with some of

1053
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,980
so for to be or not to be

1054
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:40,320
the to be or not and then we see that we already stored

1055
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:41,600
to be

1056
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:43,590
the output of this case

1057
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:45,690
and that putting that we need to

1058
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:46,640
ford works

1059
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:47,920
it will work

1060
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:49,770
twelve symbols

1061
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:55,240
two four single actually five hundred five symbols from this position

1062
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:01,940
it's pretty simple

1063
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:07,460
it's pretty simple

1064
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,390
it's extremely fast

1065
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:12,000
and if you were compression of

1066
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:14,720
because they always compress that

1067
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,960
maybe four times before

1068
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,910
most of the land

1069
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,510
and if again if your processes

1070
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:24,700
natural that

1071
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,000
you're in the

1072
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:32,900
and the it's always want on on the current hardware if you don't need to

1073
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,290
random access

1074
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:40,320
the compress and process because of the compressed file

1075
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:44,700
and with this we decided for all those search engine that

1076
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:49,110
all collection coming to compress in

1077
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:55,580
as compression or sort of the compression of the samples is another story

1078
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,810
but this is very close

1079
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:02,940
with five string bass compression algorithm

1080
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,990
we don't know that the size of all compress data

1081
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,400
the last hour in that they would be less than uncompressed data

1082
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:17,770
and it's very common situation in modern search engines

1083
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:23,710
if we are talking about local search engine something that you get on CD the

1084
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:27,680
i'm not talking about huge search engines we have another dimension

1085
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:34,010
it's always enjoyable to feed everything inside uncompressed data

1086
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:37,300
so it is very common situation

1087
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:43,780
the data what we have to have flags field called and all other stuff like

1088
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:45,340
this like for example

1089
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:52,800
talk to the first lecture about quality of

1090
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:55,450
syntactic information is no no

1091
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,970
is it no no no so

1092
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:02,770
this is all flags and for all the selected in all the

1093
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:07,440
they all have pretty stable distribution for example

1094
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:13,350
words from title and not very common body the most common type of you in

1095
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:15,600
our toy example so we know

1096
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:21,260
like in this example these according to and all that

1097
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:22,550
why do

1098
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:29,570
they the most common the common situation and that will be and some other other

1099
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:33,670
future where you have the document be

1100
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:37,170
we can for all this data

1101
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:41,410
we can create these have perfect recall

1102
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:43,060
for all this stuff

1103
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,290
and if we are going to

1104
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:51,270
store all the data in our in using this court and that

1105
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:54,310
right now we know that for

1106
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:59,100
flag and all other attributes of feature that we extracted

1107
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:00,840
we have

1108
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:07,110
perfect called that works very well and we are going to use it in analysis

1109
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:10,260
so that you know now how to store text

1110
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,820
and if you know how to store attribute

1111
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,570
and the next module while the system is

1112
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:21,190
and for dictionary

1113
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:24,320
but actually we need to

1114
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:27,320
implement some special structure because

1115
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,280
what is dictionary dictionary is the structure of doing here much

1116
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,650
we are getting really get to work with church

1117
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:39,460
in the dictionary for this road to get some additional information about this work

1118
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,630
and then we going to do

1119
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:45,240
really this addition information something if we for example

1120
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:50,400
already so they were never so that's what we can simply add to put forth

1121
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,280
leased additional points

1122
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,400
if there

1123
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,030
i haven't seen this work

1124
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:57,880
this you know processing you can

1125
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,710
and this what the dictionary

1126
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:04,080
a lot of that stuff to read you know the early database papers they were

1127
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,500
all fairly mathematical ways of explaining

1128
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,120
the really why putting things in these tables matter

1129
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:15,000
right so so one of my challenges to the community

1130
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,190
is there

1131
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:20,770
while may or may not be the necessary is piece of the story well linked

1132
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:25,370
data may or may not be necessary as a piece of the story neither is

1133
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:33,080
for the needs of this community academic community surviving into the future we must find

1134
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:38,980
formalism that sort of our equivalent of a DB calculus or that takes what's going

1135
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:43,600
on in the abox world and models of formally as we can model what's going

1136
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,940
on the but also i want to model

1137
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:49,750
when this began web that there's a whole lot of distributed sparql and all seven

1138
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:50,690
to OWL

1139
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:55,040
what i do is i all that distributed pakistan stuff until the baby is in

1140
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:59,170
a box in the traditional sense and then i can talk about subsuming in various

1141
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:03,040
things but i just want you know the real power stuff which is getting messed

1142
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:05,870
in the first part of the web

1143
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:11,290
i used every time i give semantic web to underline were web lots and lots

1144
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:15,150
of times that's what's new about the way this is not the traditional

1145
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:22,120
in AI experts system vision is embracing all that really powerful web technology

1146
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:25,310
but it's not ignoring the eye vision is

1147
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:28,830
right it's bringing those two things together so this is just one

1148
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:31,810
think at the end of my talk by way

1149
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:34,810
i have some slides and not the shape of research challenges for

1150
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:38,060
propagate two or three years ago i lived there for those of you who are

1151
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:41,670
looking for doctorate topic or something like that and and this sort of built in

1152
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:44,600
the context of this thing is i knew i wouldn't have

1153
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:47,960
so i think we need a sufficient formalism

1154
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,120
that can define what

1155
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,210
ontology is not an ontology really are

1156
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:56,920
so what does it mean to be in the world of ontology is not have

1157
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:06,080
includes all sorts of stuff about linking not external reference that are not find real

1158
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:13,190
link that includes not so traditional ontology languages that these two great big things like

1159
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:18,750
the maximal lyapunov but what i want to stuff and also the together

1160
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:23,250
right one case which is very few very large things but other cases which is

1161
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:29,120
i got three hundred twenty thousand databases literally that we've found from government websites that

1162
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,730
we have put together

1163
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:34,850
absolutely level and we'd like to be able to say something about winding them up

1164
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:38,390
we're using a little bit of vocabulary it

1165
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:43,560
it doesn't talk nice and research paper anything other than we built an nice government

1166
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:50,250
and i think we have to figure out how to bring more and more discussion

1167
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:55,460
of the so called non expressive formalism or in fact real world errors into into

1168
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:56,460
our thing

1169
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,980
as we bring rules and as we do other things and we get this to

1170
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:02,770
famous slide what is an ontology

1171
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:08,120
that we have to stop using likely likely most you have so early on and

1172
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:10,980
i hope i don't see much use in some

1173
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:15,500
but it was an idea to say that there is something that happens in the

1174
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:19,560
form of space but now we need to say can we find an ontology that

1175
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:25,420
in a sense covers all object we find the formalism model that covers all this

1176
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,920
here's an idea about how to get the right i think you reminded me yesterday

1177
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:36,870
but in fact you know you've all seen under the little robotic vacuum cleaners around

1178
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:42,000
according to a recent thing i read write company i that sold a million of

1179
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,080
them last year

1180
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,330
that's a good consumer

1181
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:52,580
once upon a time there were these big fights in the robotics community between those

1182
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:56,650
folks who want everything to refer primarily doing mathematics

1183
01:17:56,670 --> 01:18:00,210
route planning and those people who are sorry using proxy

1184
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:02,850
what happens somebody threw a meaning

1185
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:04,210
in the called

1186
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:06,560
robot vacuum cleaner

1187
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:10,690
and what he did was he said let's ignore your stuff works just show me

1188
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:11,540
one it

1189
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:15,670
and here's some furniture furniture random room

1190
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:17,710
and then show us your coverage

1191
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:21,140
what it is the first one which have got together and said well you know

1192
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:27,310
we covered ninety seven percent of object we cover eighty seven percent with seventeen minutes

1193
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:31,150
and they said well you know we didn't ninety two percent of the room

1194
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:33,420
in twenty three minutes

1195
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:35,370
totally meaningless that

1196
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,830
but then they put up the pictures

1197
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:41,390
and the first one which was a big open space

1198
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:46,190
it was completely evacuated but in your furniture really bad

1199
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:47,680
and the second one

1200
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:51,470
was greeted around furniture when you look at the big open spaces that were sort

1201
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:53,750
you know gaps

1202
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:59,590
the following year everybody had hybrid systems there was starting to get ninety seven percent

1203
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:01,130
of the thirteen

1204
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:03,180
to make everyone agreed was increased

1205
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:09,880
now it improve the formalism but improve performance because they started thinking about common problem

1206
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:14,290
like that shown in the last challenge and finding out today before i get my

1207
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:16,960
summary is how do we e

1208
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:21,180
develop hybrids have the best features of linked data

1209
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:25,420
and the ontology and we started finding some problems that we can try

1210
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:27,190
all of our stuff

1211
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,180
not one piece of the

1212
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:31,840
how do we bring that stuff together as a community

1213
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:34,560
in summary

1214
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:38,650
the infrastructure of say this is my summary this is actually summary slide from an

1215
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:39,840
earlier time

1216
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,840
but i want to point out so this talk was going back to two thousand

1217
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:47,550
one where the agents we started remember this family

1218
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:52,350
it's markup language for agents it was all about things that would help us to

1219
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:54,180
process the information

1220
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:57,600
nowadays when we look at most of the stuff coming out as and what we

1221
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,310
don't see all that much of that that that my other challenges let's bring back

1222
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:02,880
the agents

1223
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,040
why the semantic web will never work no reason at all

1224
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:08,720
the semantic web is here

1225
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,340
it is working and will continue to do so

1226
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,220
but it is not

1227
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:18,680
the semantic web as vision fifteen years ago it's the first wave

1228
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,790
if we want to see the second and third and eventually

1229
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,630
you know the realization

1230
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:25,970
to move to the next level

1231
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:29,880
and to be all that we as a community aspired for nearly

1232
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:33,470
we have to revisit and update the early versions of what we going for the

1233
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:36,960
modern web web is different now now than it was ten years ago

1234
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:39,920
we have to figure out our stuff the news

1235
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:43,970
we must unify these competing models of linked data

1236
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:48,290
machine readable vocabularies and all that and we have to to step up

1237
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:52,300
to some research challenges that face it's not enough to just build a system that

1238
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,340
works for being able to explain

1239
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:57,340
why first four how do we compare

1240
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:59,760
how do we evaluate it thank you

1241
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,460
so when i told them that the were evaluated here

1242
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,590
so the way it was but it

1243
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:10,190
it's got to be evaluating the stuff in the vision and motion towards the vision

1244
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:11,590
not how do we

1245
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,870
how do we evaluate the stuff

1246
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:17,280
message in real time you don't want to speak and then wait for a minute

1247
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:20,470
or so until the message is decoded has to be done now

1248
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:24,810
so this message passing out and we'll talk about let me just demonstrated in in

1249
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:27,560
practice free on one of these codes

1250
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:33,060
so what i'm showing you here it is

1251
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,530
so it's a little demonstration of

1252
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:37,740
how you might clean up an image

1253
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:41,910
so i'm showing your code it has roughly ten thousand bits

1254
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:46,830
so it means that the graphical model that has roughly ten thousand of those circular

1255
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:53,310
and the way built it's got five thousand of those square variables those factor nodes

1256
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:55,120
are those parity checks

1257
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:57,220
right so big graphs

1258
01:21:57,220 --> 01:22:01,580
and what you observe is you observe this image which has been corrupted by some

1259
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:03,260
speckle noise

1260
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:07,100
and what we're going to do is we use the sum product algorithm can run

1261
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:12,740
it on the underlying graph will see tomorrow what it does and you'll see that

1262
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,620
cleans up the image

1263
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,100
so it's running iterations

1264
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:20,030
and it's done

1265
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:25,990
so fourteen iterations there on ten thousand it essentially recovering the

1266
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:37,030
the code word in this case which was the clean image recovered perfectly

1267
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:44,450
no no tree graphs that's interesting things so you'd like it to be a tree

1268
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:49,640
graph because then sum product algorithm would be exact will see this tomorrow but it

1269
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:53,640
turns out that if you use trees to build codes they're not good codes there

1270
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,560
sort of bad codes in the sense that can be made precise

1271
01:22:56,620 --> 01:23:00,780
so all good code things like turbo codes what this is what i'm showing you

1272
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:04,990
is called a low density parity check code all good codes had cycles

1273
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:08,970
and so this is one of the reasons why belief propagation or some product on

1274
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:10,970
graphs with cycles this is probably the

1275
01:23:10,970 --> 01:23:15,490
the single largest success story of it in any application

1276
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:19,010
right because it's it's in all of your devices as we speak

1277
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,510
so it's key that has cycles

1278
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:33,040
any other questions

1279
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:35,870
let's look at this code quickly

1280
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:37,970
i mean just explain what i was doing

1281
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:40,240
so what this means was

1282
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:45,450
when i was generating the noisy version i was flipping six per was on average

1283
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:49,110
o was flipping a coin with the probability point zero six of making it a

1284
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:51,160
bad pixels

1285
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:53,510
so i crafting only six percent

1286
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:57,030
six percent of the pixels

1287
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,600
so you might as well you made it too easy so we can try slightly

1288
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,970
harder problem all cruft about

1289
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:05,160
seven and a half percent

1290
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:09,260
and i don't know what's going to happen because it's random it may work it

1291
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:11,220
may not this sort of

1292
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,560
near the threshold of what this code can do

1293
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:19,760
OK so that worked if i ran it again it might not work at that

1294
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:24,200
if i go

1295
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:28,780
two high i crop something like ten or twelve percent let's do ten percent it

1296
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,410
it will fail i think

1297
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:35,390
almost assuredly and now it's even more corrupted

1298
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:38,890
and we'll see the algorithm because it's on graphs with cycles

1299
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:42,700
you see that sort of partly cleaned up a bit of the image but now

1300
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,970
it's just kind of oscillating it's bouncing back and forth

1301
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:50,240
so the graph is not an actress who can see tomorrow doesn't always converge in

1302
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:54,700
this case the problem is too hard for it it failed to decode properly

1303
01:24:54,720 --> 01:25:01,010
but that's not surprising because for those of you know about shannon theory

1304
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:03,580
the the shannon limit for this problem

1305
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,560
no matter whatever you do can do better than eleven percent so if you have

1306
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:15,370
ten percent this code but eight percent that's that's actually quite good it's reasonable

1307
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:20,580
OK so any other questions

1308
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:32,120
so i took the image and i've had it with

1309
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:38,760
yeah essentially the linear algebraic metric the images some sequence of zeros and ones

1310
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:42,740
by shifting all the words by the image i can make the all zeros vector

1311
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:46,970
are is the reflexive transitive closure of the sigma

1312
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:50,780
and this looks really weird and you should be suspicious of it says if if

1313
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,220
if i stroke

1314
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,840
box five

1315
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:56,560
in five through here and

1316
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,570
in the next day for flies through

1317
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:09,280
box if i is true here

1318
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,160
well then phi is true here

1319
01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:14,910
and in the next day box if five true

1320
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:19,390
sorry in the next eight books if of

1321
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:22,400
five string which means that if phi is true here

1322
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:25,860
and the faces of that means that phi is true

1323
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,590
for five string

1324
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:33,730
which says are five true here

1325
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:35,840
which specifies true and so on

1326
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:36,800
what this

1327
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,270
is actually of fixed point

1328
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:41,650
and that's why

1329
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:44,730
one half of the fixed point equation is that

1330
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:48,410
our is the reflexive transitive closure of sigma

1331
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:54,490
this is our is in the reflexive transitive closure sigma this is equal to one

1332
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,380
you can read this is an induction axiom

1333
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:03,220
say something like this

1334
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:09,070
the induction axiom you know for the integers

1335
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:10,180
it says

1336
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:14,040
if it's the case that all times in the future

1337
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:16,540
five being true here

1338
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:20,810
implies that phi is true in the next day

1339
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:25,430
if at all times in the future it's the case that phi implies

1340
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:27,930
next five

1341
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:29,910
data that's true everywhere

1342
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,600
as soon as five becomes true here

1343
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:37,620
box five string here

1344
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:39,620
i want to say

1345
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,660
if you can

1346
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:43,350
if the induction hypothesis takes you from

1347
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,100
the i state-of-the-art plus first the

1348
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:49,850
if you can do the induction step remained in plus one

1349
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:51,410
starting at zero

1350
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:53,300
it means you can prove

1351
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,820
for all integers

1352
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:59,040
think about it the more it exactly the induction

1353
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:03,200
steady conduction that we do over the integers when we prove the property of the

1354
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,770
this the

1355
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:09,950
says that whenever you find to your site true

1356
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:12,330
ben diamond if size to be true

1357
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:14,840
and if you want to see the intuitions they

1358
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:17,620
it's this park

1359
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:20,030
whenever find two size true

1360
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:24,320
there has to be a future point where size true that's demanded and then something

1361
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:30,660
that's the first time

1362
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:34,760
and this is also a fixed point equations like this

1363
01:28:34,770 --> 01:28:46,820
it says if i until zidane something so let's have a look at that

1364
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:51,330
so this is if i until size true here

1365
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:53,560
well that's the same as saying

1366
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:56,410
that size true here

1367
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:57,230
that was

1368
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:00,830
your case where the q happen straight away

1369
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:04,050
it says well with this i happen straight away

1370
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:07,300
i don't care about the rest of the happy

1371
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,730
there's nothing to do

1372
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:11,990
as far as the five parties concerned because the until

1373
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,170
happens right now

1374
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,480
in the five part is always before

1375
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:18,390
where the until happens so there's nothing to do

1376
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:21,080
or else

1377
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:24,360
size false here

1378
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:27,340
five is true here

1379
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:31,580
and in the next state

1380
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:33,970
the thing

1381
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:36,380
resurrects itself

1382
01:29:36,410 --> 01:29:40,770
right now i suppose the thing resurrects itself then it means that here

1383
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:43,360
five until size true

1384
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:46,590
now you do the same thing again what is that they will either size true

1385
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:48,580
and your home

1386
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,280
in which case we got financial

1387
01:29:51,290 --> 01:29:52,410
or else

1388
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:57,040
not size tree here five true here and the thing resurrects itself is what i

1389
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,220
mean by fixed point

1390
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:02,540
and now you say well if that's true here then fine until size to be

1391
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:04,500
true here

1392
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:08,810
so either side true here in which case we got five until c

1393
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:13,120
or else size falls five string and all that

1394
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:16,170
and you keep going

1395
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:19,580
because of this part

1396
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:22,590
you know that sooner or later you're going to get to a point where you

1397
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:25,310
say size true

1398
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,410
and then you've got to the five

1399
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:31,000
all the way

1400
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:37,020
so five until size true

1401
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:38,390
puzzled looks

1402
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:50,530
that's it that's exactly the same of fleshing out the recursive definition

1403
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:53,880
right because

1404
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:57,580
what i'm saying is that if you flesh out the recursive definition

1405
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:59,970
you don't go forever

1406
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:04,060
fixed point means sooner or later you've got to start fleshing out the

1407
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,220
the nation k

1408
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:07,240
and that's

1409
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,610
this aspect is about

1410
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:14,000
it says you can't delay forever

1411
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,830
right what he says he says

1412
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:21,490
what's that character from pop by the sailor you know there's always prepared pay back

1413
01:31:21,490 --> 01:31:23,110
tomorrow something that

1414
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:26,110
financial so i will not not today

1415
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:32,080
borrows money from you don't pay you back tomorrow right

1416
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:35,170
and the fixed points is not there's going to be a time when you actually

1417
01:31:35,170 --> 01:31:37,340
pay me back right

1418
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:41,180
OK so it's exactly what you said it's the recursive equation so

1419
01:31:41,230 --> 01:31:48,270
it actually defines an infinite formula another way to look at this is actually that

1420
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:53,250
this is effectively the conjunction an infinite conjunction

1421
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:57,390
or an infinite disjunction sorry this one is actually an infinite disjunction

1422
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:03,390
and the fixed points is no it's not infinite sooner or later it bottoms out

1423
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:06,770
all right

1424
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:10,900
now what i'd like to talk to you about these tableau calculus because i just

1425
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,830
showed you hilbert calculus

1426
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:20,510
i'm going to

1427
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:22,370
do it

1428
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,170
you know

1429
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:29,430
algorithm form rather than

1430
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:34,650
you know rule rule based form

1431
01:32:36,270 --> 01:32:41,800
the top thing says if you're interested in sequent calculi for these types of logics

1432
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,220
then you either need an infinitary rule

1433
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:47,240
or you can eliminate cut

1434
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:49,500
and if you don't know what that means that's OK

1435
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:50,940
if you do then

1436
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:54,080
come talk to OK

1437
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:56,150
so what do we do we say

1438
01:32:56,820 --> 01:33:01,680
one example could be the let's try have that if we try to prove box

1439
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,050
if y

1440
01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:06,370
implies box if i

1441
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,150
right so what am i gonna do

1442
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,640
i'm going to negate this

1443
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:12,930
because that's what tableau calculi do

1444
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:14,940
so i'm going to say

1445
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:16,540
so the topics

1446
01:33:16,630 --> 01:33:18,550
one slide there

1447
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,580
just three elections

1448
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:23,680
a little bit about agent agent architectures

1449
01:33:23,690 --> 01:33:24,890
the i

1450
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,170
two hours

1451
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:27,860
the first elections

1452
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:29,550
and then

1453
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:32,760
in the last lecture on talk talking about historical issues

1454
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,160
and philosophical issues

1455
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:38,370
and there's reference to this

1456
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,120
this is the book

1457
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:44,660
i if you're interested

1458
01:33:44,690 --> 01:33:46,490
you have to buy

1459
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:48,980
this is by far the this book

1460
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:50,910
very comprehensive

1461
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:54,160
very modern up to date by two very strong people

1462
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:55,440
and it's got

1463
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:59,160
it's got the market share and they are the reason is because the book

1464
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:01,340
in fact

1465
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,090
much of the material the that

1466
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,520
you'll be able to find in

1467
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:08,810
the first two chapters

1468
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:14,150
there are about

1469
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,690
historical issues and

1470
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:18,370
agent architecture

1471
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:22,550
twenty six and twenty seven that the more about philosophical issues

1472
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:25,820
so if you want to more detail and i recommend you do

1473
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:29,350
this placed

1474
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:33,400
so feel free to interrupt at any time when we got three hours

1475
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:36,770
it's OK i can i try to answer questions about it gets all the slide

1476
01:34:36,770 --> 01:34:38,040
that's fine too

1477
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:40,630
and w chance to talk

1478
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:43,960
so if i understand correctly

1479
01:34:44,010 --> 01:34:45,290
we have a break

1480
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:48,800
is it from two to fifty three three fifteen right

1481
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:53,010
OK so i started the light which should we should elephants three

1482
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:56,180
another break brightness of the break after that

1483
01:34:56,990 --> 01:35:05,100
and questions before we get started

1484
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:09,900
the key idea here is that

1485
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:11,710
artificial intelligence

1486
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,650
is the

1487
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:16,630
the study of how one deals

1488
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,930
rational agents

1489
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:20,350
russian rationality something to

1490
01:35:20,430 --> 01:35:23,360
describing the more detail later

1491
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:25,780
so what's an agent

1492
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,520
it's not affected

1493
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,080
living environment

1494
01:35:31,090 --> 01:35:34,060
it can receive perceptron environment

1495
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:37,110
and they can apply actions to the environment

1496
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:40,770
typically it's got some some goals is trying to achieve something

1497
01:35:40,830 --> 01:35:44,270
and the task of i i would like to achieve

1498
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:48,430
the goal one set for the edges

1499
01:35:48,450 --> 01:35:49,900
what is rationality means

1500
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:53,370
well basically a rational agent does the right thing

1501
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:56,180
and how do you define what right thing is

1502
01:35:56,180 --> 01:35:59,090
you have to have some kind of performance measure

1503
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:01,700
the idea is motivated

1504
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:03,340
but performance measure

1505
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:06,270
it's trying to optimize its performance measure

1506
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:07,310
we say that

1507
01:36:07,330 --> 01:36:09,110
if it does

1508
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:13,280
and it's rational agent

1509
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:15,080
i do not applications are

1510
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:17,020
extremely personal

1511
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:19,020
cover a couple of hours

1512
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:22,470
in later in the afternoon

1513
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:26,740
in fact this the concept is so general that practically every computer system can be

1514
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:28,810
thought of as an agent some months

1515
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:30,120
usefully but

1516
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,710
the ones that doing something more sophisticated

1517
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:37,520
can be thought of any useful as agents

1518
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,270
and i should mention that

1519
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,020
there is

1520
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:42,960
some overlap between several fields here

1521
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:44,740
there's an agent community

1522
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:47,500
and there is an artificial intelligence community

1523
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:50,650
and they largely overlap not completely

1524
01:36:50,710 --> 01:36:52,740
so i'm going to be concerned about

1525
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:58,150
building intelligent systems this afternoon that's what elections at the rest later that

1526
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:01,810
the computers they're intelligent

1527
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:05,520
the other part of the asian communities interested in

1528
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:10,750
that is more concerned directly with software engineering particular

1529
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:16,720
moving software engineering from are into object oriented software engineering

1530
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:18,930
the more sophisticated forms like a

1531
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:20,800
of engineering

1532
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:23,710
so there that we talk about intelligence

1533
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:27,090
talk about building good computer systems the job that you want

1534
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:28,000
and using

1535
01:37:28,420 --> 01:37:30,880
concepts from the agent

1536
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:34,270
they're not directly concerned with

1537
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:37,670
intelligence itself intelligence pass

1538
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,860
the AI community

1539
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:44,590
gets up in the morning because there

1540
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:47,210
they want to solve this problem

1541
01:37:47,230 --> 01:37:49,020
have to tell the machine

1542
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:51,590
and if you can go about building it

1543
01:37:51,650 --> 01:38:00,720
that's what motivates them the idea of building intelligent machines

1544
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:08,660
imagine an environment to just trying introduce some terminology really

1545
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:10,920
so you imagine that

1546
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:12,730
this some environment

1547
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:15,410
in which the agent is acting

1548
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:20,130
and the environment can be many things will see some examples of the latter

1549
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:22,700
the environment send signals

1550
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:23,960
to the agent

1551
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:29,660
and these are called percepts here all observations that equivalent words

1552
01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:31,720
so these percepts received by

1553
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:35,670
the agent

1554
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:38,310
the agent can apply actions back

1555
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,770
to the environment in order to achieve some names

1556
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:44,650
so the bottom of forgive got the inside the top of the the got the

1557
01:38:44,650 --> 01:38:46,400
percepts coming across

1558
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:49,690
the signals that the agents getting from the environment and they can take many different

1559
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:56,630
at the bottom is actions that the agent can apply back to the environment

1560
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,880
in order to achieve what

1561
01:38:58,890 --> 01:39:00,750
it seems that

1562
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:02,700
and those actions

1563
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:07,190
are applied with what i call actuators

1564
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:08,070
so here

1565
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:10,290
the idea is that some kind of

1566
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:14,170
and the actuators around the legs will something but actually they can be much more

1567
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:15,990
of relative entropy

1568
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:20,910
where you take the expectation with respect to the reference measure not with respect to

1569
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:27,380
you can also do it in the original one but is not necessarily

1570
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:34,100
OK so now this especially physicists like to call it keeps inequality

1571
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:38,420
and this is actually the most important inequalities in information theory

1572
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:39,860
without a doubt

1573
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:49,000
use jensen's inequality wants to prove this one and then

1574
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:54,680
ninety nine percent of the time you don't have to use jensen's inequality again or

1575
01:39:54,680 --> 01:40:00,750
use out the lower bounds on the lower them you just use this and then

1576
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,670
i suppose you'll get

1577
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:06,250
conditions under which whatever inequality you want to show

1578
01:40:06,260 --> 01:40:08,910
actually holds with equality

1579
01:40:08,910 --> 01:40:10,440
OK so

1580
01:40:11,370 --> 01:40:19,320
this is as i say here frequently known as gibbs inequality

1581
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:20,480
now gates

1582
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:26,870
it was kind of like the the father of five

1583
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,870
statistical mechanics as we know it

1584
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:33,880
mathematical statistical

1585
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:39,180
mechanics thermodynamics and that's not what he showed

1586
01:40:40,230 --> 01:40:45,700
in in that they among other reasons because our defender b had not been invented

1587
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:47,560
yet this was nineteen o one

1588
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:49,500
this was well before

1589
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:52,000
was actually well before jenson

1590
01:40:52,010 --> 01:40:54,190
it was well before

1591
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:55,910
the definition of

1592
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:57,980
convex functions actions

1593
01:40:58,070 --> 01:41:04,400
of course convex functions have been defined before force a real valued functions and an

1594
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:13,030
functions on euclidean spaces but the modern definition of convex functions in abstract linear spaces

1595
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:15,630
that is actually do to jensen that was

1596
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:16,990
after this

1597
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:21,360
beginning of the twentieth century even though it sounds like a very fundamental concept is

1598
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:24,380
is about one hundred years old

1599
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:31,200
so it's actually what he showed it's in that inequality for forty seven at the

1600
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,430
bottom of actually what he showed was

1601
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:38,610
a special case of the nonnegativity of mutual information

1602
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:42,230
that's what that

1603
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:44,340
inequality is showing

1604
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:50,630
so it's not quite the nonnegativity of relative entropy

1605
01:41:50,650 --> 01:41:52,440
OK so let me show you now

1606
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:53,810
a couple of

1607
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:56,420
and then

1608
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:58,080
are very important

1609
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:03,230
particularly in information theory these are the bread and butter

1610
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:08,300
of all the uses of relative entropy in

1611
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:16,140
the really show why this is connected to the notion of information

1612
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:19,730
so here the idea is that you have

1613
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:23,890
think of this as a black box that has some kind of randomness inside

1614
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:31,780
so we have a black box and then we drive that black box with

1615
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:38,110
random objects that has distribution either px or qx

1616
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:45,340
and of course those distributions then the indus an output distribution

1617
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:49,400
all this is saying is there

1618
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:51,880
relative entropy

1619
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:59,570
at the input between these two distributions is derek well then the relative entropy at

1620
01:42:59,570 --> 01:43:00,960
the output

1621
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:02,640
we quality

1622
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:07,920
when when will quality well a special case that you will have equality is when

1623
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:11,580
i hear what you have is just a one-to-one transformation

1624
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:18,020
right to a one-to-one transformation is not going to change information but more

1625
01:43:18,090 --> 01:43:24,020
more importantly or more generally you're going to have equality

1626
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:28,960
what you produce here is a sufficient statistic

1627
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:31,650
for this pair of distributions

1628
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:35,640
chris immediately you we receive their this notion

1629
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:40,170
all of the information of preserving information is

1630
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:44,110
essentially equivalent to preserving relative entropy

1631
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:52,700
this one is kind of the wall here what we can is to black boxes

1632
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:55,460
but only one input distribution

1633
01:43:57,930 --> 01:44:02,350
depending on the black box we have a different output distribution and what we're saying

1634
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:04,200
is that the

1635
01:44:04,230 --> 01:44:06,100
relative entropy

1636
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,830
on knowing the input

1637
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:11,810
good writer

1638
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:17,160
then the relative entropy not condition on knowing the input

1639
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:21,410
in other words is always better to know

1640
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:23,430
the nocturnal

1641
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:30,030
at least for these purposes

1642
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:31,730
OK so this is really

1643
01:44:31,770 --> 01:44:35,810
all there is here is the complexity of the fact that

1644
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:43,520
a relative entropy is convex in the pair of distributions p and q

1645
01:44:45,690 --> 01:44:48,670
another very important property

1646
01:44:48,670 --> 01:44:49,950
is the chain rule

1647
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:53,800
and no matter how many

1648
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:59,380
random bible you can you have the joint distribution of several random variables but you

1649
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,710
do have to have the same number

1650
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:03,010
on both sides

1651
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:05,680
unlike mutual information where you can have

1652
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:08,250
anything you want on both sides

1653
01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:13,500
here remember that you have to have distributions that are defined on the same set

1654
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:18,670
thanks to the user alone

1655
01:45:18,690 --> 01:45:23,150
the way the

1656
01:45:23,170 --> 01:45:25,000
helper that

1657
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:27,070
well there's a square root

1658
01:45:32,230 --> 01:45:33,760
we now

1659
01:45:33,770 --> 01:45:37,880
we're very quickly with a lot of time but the going to be

1660
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,590
is that what happens

1661
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:46,090
when we think it is sufficiently large so we we get some some into the

1662
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:50,480
on the bound so let me let me concentrate

1663
01:45:50,490 --> 01:45:52,410
we concentrate on the

1664
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:54,640
this is about the whole

1665
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:58,500
for any you offer anything the nonseparable

1666
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,820
if the stream is terrible

1667
01:46:01,870 --> 01:46:06,480
then the this term and this term go away

1668
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:12,130
so we left with the bound of the form

1669
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:16,090
the minus one i

1670
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:21,250
x pp where the

1671
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:26,930
humans where there

1672
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:35,770
the pair of

1673
01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:41,340
and now we look back to see what is the effect of changing the

1674
01:46:41,450 --> 01:46:42,890
the only thing we do

1675
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:47,250
i mean the only our only criteria will be responded

1676
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:50,370
in a separate prisoners

1677
01:46:50,380 --> 01:46:52,860
we can write

1678
01:46:52,870 --> 01:46:56,600
if we can write the because we look at this expression here

1679
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:58,930
and now we can upper bound

1680
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:02,240
part here in the following way

1681
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:04,000
we've been mined

1682
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:13,290
in the

1683
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:15,990
x being

1684
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,190
is created the

1685
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:19,760
now this

1686
01:47:19,810 --> 01:47:23,940
corresponds to to the minus one

1687
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:27,860
are you

1688
01:47:35,190 --> 01:47:35,660
two there

1689
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:40,550
the whole thing but that's all over

1690
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,740
and now

1691
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:45,020
this is the well

1692
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:51,290
the minus one

1693
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:56,100
and then take across the commission here the times the maximum will be

1694
01:47:56,110 --> 01:47:57,120
which is the

1695
01:47:57,130 --> 01:47:59,760
we can write that

1696
01:48:01,090 --> 01:48:04,910
i don't think the math but we understand the math

1697
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:10,320
like to the sea

1698
01:48:10,340 --> 01:48:13,310
if they can do

1699
01:48:15,410 --> 01:48:18,730
been on

1700
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:22,300
of r anything nor would be

1701
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:25,020
but there a lot of the people

1702
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:27,630
i think

1703
01:48:30,130 --> 01:48:32,760
so is

1704
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:34,450
so then

1705
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:36,600
i get

1706
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:41,850
the minus one

1707
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:43,820
infinity norm squared

1708
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:45,750
can pick it up

1709
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:47,380
and i have seen

1710
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:51,770
the that through all of you

1711
01:48:51,820 --> 01:48:56,000
because you can always write for my you which i

1712
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:59,720
recall you're ugly to

1713
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:02,640
if they think

1714
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:12,490
log of d

1715
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:16,060
where d is the dimension

1716
01:49:16,130 --> 01:49:18,640
number of components of a vector

1717
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:22,080
but this choice

1718
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:24,250
this is the most

1719
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:27,770
a i get

1720
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:32,700
ln b

1721
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:34,510
this term

1722
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:41,700
very upper bound to the stake they get x being

1723
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:44,770
if is

1724
01:49:44,850 --> 01:49:46,300
and then this

1725
01:49:46,350 --> 01:49:47,810
it is

1726
01:49:47,870 --> 01:49:49,550
the route

1727
01:49:49,610 --> 01:49:51,880
the power of god divided by

1728
01:49:51,890 --> 01:49:53,810
two lnd

1729
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:55,680
this is actually

1730
01:49:55,730 --> 01:49:57,430
e to b

1731
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:59,600
ln the

1732
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:08,750
between Exxon y all in fact you can move into generalized case that a secondary

1733
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:19,890
that also distracted function is busy tradition only if we give military each between between

the new you've sales that you have

01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:26,280
Hudson of the other data that treats which is also involved in this approach on

1744
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:32,810
the fallible Q. also wanted that size which is dedicated to exponential family alluding to

1745
01:51:32,810 --> 01:51:42,130
the gates of exponential factors in these during value facts and he's delighted to function

1746

1750
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:07,960
also be absolutely inch between and I just want to which we call on the

1751
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:09,650
Commission geometry

1752
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:17,350
what which is cooperating don't go processing the heart we want to computers and the

1753
01:52:17,350 --> 01:52:22,180
Internet to do with the between between 2 and is on the ballot some of

1754
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:31,070
symmetry budget judicial so in fact exuded literature is a different approach to external the

1755
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:39,460
geometric between of 2 computers which imagery commune but much of the Uganda computer intended

1756
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:47,850
to push is a series of so initiates a buy it will buy a busy

1757
01:52:47,850 --> 01:52:57,180

1758
01:52:57,220 --> 01:53:02,260
on the as I committee meeting of on each week on bills to true geometric

1759
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:13,800
power but we use those expression is that fact it's is this week it's a

1760
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:24,460
question of so it's very simple answers the geometric mean of this edition of seclusion

1761
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:30,370
produced just have to to this fate this nitrates and tool to Mitch applied by

1762
01:53:30,370 --> 01:53:36,500
the country's seized on this side on then you could tell that the square off

1763
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:42,350
will you because the square on the text of the square root of this situation

1764
01:53:42,350 --> 01:53:46,830
which is exist because the the system to give the mattress is on the menu

1765
01:53:46,830 --> 01:53:48,060
in which applied by

1766
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:52,610
the square root of aid on each side on you as a final expiration of

1767
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:57,300
the geometric mean 2 mattresses

1768
01:53:57,310 --> 01:54:05,020
on the judiciary could also complicate the GOP is unique in the space between 2

1769
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:11,440
mattresses and even basic expressions so when she is equipped to do all the glory

1770
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:17,280
days when she equal to 1 morning he on 43 . 1 as well as

1771
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:21,780
to exactly the geometric mean between the 2 militaries

1772
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:27,350
you could tell that we use as many times as the squalor defamatory so you

1773
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:34,520
have different NATO to compute description of a film match which but also a radio

1774
01:54:34,530 --> 01:54:40,520
program using MATLAB 2 books

1775
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:50,960
so where Jesus amid ideology inquisitive this terrific space in a case that

1776
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:58,070
suggested that in Atqasuk appeared in geometry affect you have you as you know you

1777
01:54:58,070 --> 01:55:00,760
have this cemetery

1778
01:55:01,130 --> 01:55:08,740
the fastest Dimitri facts admitted communities and I don't believe he speaks is equipped with

1779
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:14,350
to admit a community could be required to guide the souls who admitted communities in

1780
01:55:14,350 --> 01:55:20,940
value and by military on in fact when he walks on own on that fits

1781
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:28,680
of the dictatorship but refused to Cemetery is just like a solicitation has been replaced

1782
01:55:28,690 --> 01:55:36,020
by application on admitting community and replaced by a geometric mean which is owned by

1783
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:39,300
the city which is on the mend

1784
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:43,960
on the extension of of Galileo case

1785
01:55:44,090 --> 01:55:52,030
given by the Commission consoling flights is the existence of a new symmetry which calls

1786
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:56,830
for all those appoint a two-point beat all the invariant point is given by the

1787
01:55:56,830 --> 01:56:08,930
geometric mean between AMD onto dozens Cheerios which space that locality some sources

1788
01:56:09,200 --> 01:56:13,780
so it is

1789
01:56:14,030 --> 01:56:20,910
also related to 2 convicts were in fact the article effective so that the longer

1790
