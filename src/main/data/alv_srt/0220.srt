1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,470
the rental

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,540
values how their fluctuating from

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,200
from a to a to respect for example or you want to see

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,240
the traffic in some places some drastic change

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,410
compared to

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,350
previous months or weeks

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,600
so and when that happens people want to know what is the main reason is

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,540
because of the

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,740
population growth for or some breakdown or

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,040
there are you know rules

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,730
you know somebody the

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,850
being or something and so forth

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,690
and you'll be surprised that you know sometimes you know

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,430
in a large

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,990
you know huge countries you have various

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,600
administrative departments they don't necessarily communicate each other so for example let's say

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,830
somebody digging the road

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,730
probably influenced the local municipality

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,070
but not necessarily traffic control devices for example

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,020
so they want to change the signal and then you come there and then you

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,090
realize are going to morning you try to see which way i can

22
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,920
get out of this place and go somewhere

23
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,090
there was a classic movie thing was done by israeli forces

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,000
most beautiful program and bureaucracy

25
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,390
for this person who comes from

26
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,270
escaped from the mental asylum

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,740
man is defined

28
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,390
you know what they call these digging devices you know that compression one

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,310
goes into the main traffic

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,000
and if the

31
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,440
the police things this is a legitimate one they put barriers to protect it

32
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,960
and then the the the water management people think all we have to stop the

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,520
what this topic nobody knows and this guy seriously misleading the thing

34
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,500
so finally it goes on for a week in the whole film you can't stop

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,710
laughing and you know you can't sit on your journey anymore to what

36
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,170
so it's actually

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,180
marking the government and how they work and lack of communication and finally they recognise

38
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,860
that the lost the patient from the mental asylum

39
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,860
so so it's it's really

40
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,860
the contest mining might help

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,710
you know what this is you know we been missing person year

42
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,770
road is being that there may be you make some connection

43
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,500
OK so

44
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,100
classification association rules

45
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,480
so in this case

46
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,230
i'm not going to

47
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,370
go talk about this association rules this is another very big area

48
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,590
guideline in brackish aggarwal

49
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,140
i think it did this paper

50
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,050
kind number n so

51
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,550
not more than maybe ten or fifteen years ago

52
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,090
this paper is quite simple

53
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,060
you know

54
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,390
you don't need more than a high school education

55
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,600
to understand that

56
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,710
and that is probably cited no more than ten thousand times more

57
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,220
and the guy's not elected to the academy

58
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,350
USA canada national academy which is

59
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,940
very tough to elected

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,700
that it was such an infinite

61
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,190
influential one

62
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,100
he created tool

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,800
two and i was almost

64
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,300
kennedy international conferences of these qualities

65
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,040
and solar cell journals

66
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,050
from that one page

67
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,480
and that's association rules

68
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,060
and basically what the association rules do is that

69
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,120
let's see you you have a relational

70
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,230
that is given to you

71
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,410
and and then you have features so what you're doing is you're trying to find

72
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,520
the patterns

73
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,640
let's say

74
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,460
beta one taking to this value peter to take into this value and so forth

75
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,160
and if you see that

76
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,660
then you say that

77
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,080
you know this is the secret we have the feature that in his context but

78
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,450
here we used

79
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,710
all classifiers as especially tribute but they don't have to be so basically in his

80
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,560
a set of values here a set of rounds here what you're saying is if

81
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,880
i see the set of values

82
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,800
there's is a good chance i will see these values so in some sense what

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,270
he's doing is is doing

84
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,340
between group of values to group of

85
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,310
that that's what association rules and then you give two parameters and one parameter is

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,690
the probability to see

87
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,880
the pattern

88
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,640
of all these values

89
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,640
and the other one tells you that

90
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,580
what is the confidence that means if i have seen the x values

91
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,500
what is the chance that i'm going to see this one you give you a

92
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,610
that means there are cases that x part is true

93
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,540
but this is not his fault

94
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,810
so that gives you

95
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,320
less than one hundred percent accuracy so so basically support means that how many instances

96
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,220
i have

97
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,800
has this pattern

98
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,420
both ex

99
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,670
and c to be true

100
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,710
that's the probability that is that is

101
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,520
and then sees that tracy part of x how many times seized that is the

102
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,960
so one of these two parameters is given

103
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,120
when you meant to find all the combinations of these problems

104
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,750
and and that's what association rules

105
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,960
and in our case

106
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,720
we are not interested in very general

107
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,340
patterns but we are only interested in RDF group of values

108
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,680
all features that tells you

109
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,150
and then also boosting with soft margins i'm going to talk about later so we

110
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,020
have a slightly modified loss function and

111
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,250
and these weights it's actually quite similar to logistic regression

112
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,550
let's try to understand what's

113
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,950
what this level reaching on what is actually doing

114
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,900
i mean this is essentially an optimisation technique so into the optimisation technique which is

115
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,610
already known which has been analysed before was in

116
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,210
optimisation in the field of optimisation was the one of coordinate descent and i'm showing

117
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,910
you that according to send essentially what what leveraging doing

118
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,560
OK let me introduce what call consensus

119
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,150
so this might be negative so you might not you should not use the like

120
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:23,510
the way the classification error but these extract so they use this some of the

121
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,800
DNA label of x and so many use this then these rates can also be

122
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,230
then it's the distribution anymore so this distribution property only comes from the use of

123
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,510
the relative entropy will from the exponential function

124
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,620
so it's a kind of a special case

125
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,130
OK so

126
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,630
gordon descent

127
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,750
let's say we would like to minimize a function that is a function of several

128
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,830
variables let's say b j j variables OK

129
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:03,920
and particularly simple strategy to minimize this function is that we iteratively selecting one very

130
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,960
minimize with respect to that variable and then select another

131
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,120
OK and continue iterating this until you have reached the minimum

132
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,770
there's actually converges when

133
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,500
one historian i mean

134
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,050
under certain conditions the conditions include conditions on the function and also on the order

135
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,710
of selecting these very points when you select always the same variable you probably want

136
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:35,000
to minimize function if the function is not smooth you might doesn't converge

137
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,220
to the minimum

138
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,270
so how

139
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,850
OK so how do you choose these directions so that different strategy you could for

140
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:46,500
instance choose these variables just at random

141
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,740
that already works under certain conditions but made might not be the most efficient way

142
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,990
this something which is called round robin essentially you go you start with the first

143
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,210
variable then the second third and so on you just go over the all the

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,930
there is also not very efficient when you have a very large number of variables

145
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,620
that's another method which is called gauss southwell scheme

146
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,660
so that's selecting the variable which has the largest gradient component so you look at

147
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,940
all the variables sorry

148
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:28,850
you look at all the variables you compute the gradient in in in that direction

149
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,250
and then choose the variable which has the largest gradient component so the largest absolute

150
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,580
value of the great in that direction

151
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,790
OK that is called gauss southwell the message and

152
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,080
the show you will see is actually doing

153
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,280
and then you could of course also choose the direction which leads to the maximum

154
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,670
improvement of the objective so but this is much harder to find k

155
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:58,000
so in this converges under certain conditions i'm going to outline these conditions no

156
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,680
OK so maybe

157
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:05,220
to make it very explicit how this related to boosting OK so i to leverage

158
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,500
its abeid leveraging the only for hypotheses in the hypothesis set

159
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,820
OK now i'm doing three iterations of leveraging

160
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,840
so initially all the rights of the of these poor possesion persisted as year

161
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:24,040
now in the first iteration we just choose one hypothesis which has the largest gradient

162
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,300
component points

163
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,100
that might be this

164
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,000
the second hypothesis

165
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,160
so if two different sets of first one set of others on the hypothesis set

166
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,230
on i mean that we have policies and the hypothesis that has not

167
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,580
and then we have this on which is chosen in the right so this is

168
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,610
the first iteration so i for one is this value

169
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,880
this is associated with the second hypothesis so this up to to

170
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,630
little is equal to this OK in the first iteration i mean this mapping between

171
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,330
these two

172
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,390
OK so the second iteration you might use of this could have

173
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,810
this is the reward is

174
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,330
the escape from water escape

175
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:12,750
that's a rule

176
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,540
the mutant do they eventually acquired memory

177
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,520
right they they do if you know what this is what we call or what

178
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,810
if you

179
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,600
forced them to do it many taken on much longer than one week

180
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,220
eventually they find their way

181
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,470
two to find the proper what they know

182
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,580
if you do that if you look at animals

183
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,160
in some of the activity in the brain

184
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,140
actually campus independent some other parts of the brain is compensating

185
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,160
there is the second backup mechanism we

186
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,310
but we don't usually use

187
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,390
one among the interviews

188
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,290
so we have yes if you look at the

189
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,850
memory which is another

190
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,020
paradigms task

191
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,490
which is known to be

192
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,080
OK with independent you know if you are surgically removing the campus around and then

193
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,790
they can do some kind of task memory task

194
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,430
you know they can do it

195
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,620
and for those kind of task of course this animal

196
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,850
is not

197
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,700
i will try to emphasise different kind of memories i'm only right now talking about

198
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,850
focusing on

199
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,140
this because i will memory we take all the credit memory can depend on the

200
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,720
current web

201
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,160
and the spatial memory is one of those

202
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,700
OK i skip this

203
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,970
that's right

204
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,930
taking longer than i thought i want to introduce you to

205
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,220
just following this question

206
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,060
put a different kind of memory

207
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,660
called working memory that probably some of you have heard of this political phrase

208
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,510
working memory is very crucial

209
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,850
for the data

210
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,560
for me

211
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,660
typical typical approach

212
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,180
although became working memory probably is due to ageing

213
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:18,450
if the old often grace the my grasses i can find way i put the

214
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,410
grasses minutes ago because my mind was something else and i have more of the

215
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,270
we find

216
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,100
to find it so in other words

217
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,970
if you're working memory the working well

218
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,830
can you hold information

219
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,540
of specific information for some period of time while you're doing something else

220
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,220
and then you can accomplish what you have to do

221
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,620
and it is known that the working memory is very

222
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,020
each dependent

223
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,950
so o

224
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,390
it is different compared to their spatial memory where you acquired by

225
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:58,350
many training center and p BP the training and gradually acquired the memory this is

226
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,580
the sort of one short thing and in the short-term memory which is we you

227
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,790
know where i put them in the rest of the here today this morning

228
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,720
it's not going to be used for tomorrow

229
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,290
that information is not useful because i'm putting somewhere else

230
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,560
but this one is different this this one is the testing working memory with the

231
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,160
it's called eight on radio maybe see appendix express

232
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,060
the central area from which the eight arms

233
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,700
the project

234
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:36,510
the residual so this is the difference between the correct output and the actual output generated

235
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:44,390
by the current weight vector the current function so this is a vector of residuals and now we're trying

236
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:50,290
to actually minimize a squared error so these square

237
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,190
those residuals the norm squared of that vector is the sum

238
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:59,390
of the squares of those residuals so this is our error term

239
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,050
and what we do in a ridge regression is actually introduce a

240
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,800
regularization term which is controlling the norm of

241
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:14,170
the weight vector that we use so we trade off we minimize W over a term that

242
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:20,890
involves the norm squared of W scaled by a parameter lambda which is referred to as the

243
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,530
regularization parameter plus this error term which is

244
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,790
dependent on W through that function G that

245
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,390
or through this X W here so xi depends on W as

246
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,990
well so this is our error terms so the choice of W will attempt

247
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,670
to make the error term small but not if that involves

248
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,690
making a very very large norm weight vector so it's

249
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,990
trading complexity of the weight vector with the error on

250
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,850
the on the training data so this is the optimisation

251
00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:01,110
that is adopted for ridge regression so let's just run through it see what

252
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,950
happens well we can explicitly write our xi squared as Y

253
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:15,630
minus X W Y minus X W in a product with itself if we multiply out this in a product we get the following and then if we set the derivative of this quantity equal

254
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:21,050
to zero we get the following equation X X

255
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,990
primed X W that comes from this term here which with a

256
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:35,190
factor two but I've cancelled the two and we take the X primed Y on to the other side and this lambda W comes from the derivative of

257
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,270
this term so this is the derivative of this set equal to zero

258
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,250
and treated as an equation okay so this is what

259
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,150
we're trying to solve and clearly we can solve it by just inverting

260
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:52,820
this matrix and that in the indeed gives us what's known as the primal

261
00:15:53,070 --> 00:16:01,230
weight vector solution so we use the term primal to mean the explicit

262
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,870
representation in the of the weight vector in the feature

263
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,150
space now in this case it's in the input space but if we were doing

264
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:13,070
in a more complex feature space it would again be in that

265
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,630
in that feature space so this is the primal solution

266
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:27,370
vector all I've done is just invert this matrix and apply it to this side here and it's got by just setting the derivative of this equal to zero so notice

267
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,270
because it's a linear function we are optimizing there's

268
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,430
unique solution well and a quadratic loss so it's a convex

269
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,530
loss as a unique solution and we can actually

270
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,610
explicitly write it out and we can find it by solving a set

271
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:47,350
of linear equations is very straight forward and if we want a regress on a new data point we can just

272
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,670
take the weight vector and take the inner product with that

273
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:58,710
new data point and here we have the explicit representation so this is just you know regularized least squares regression

274
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,750
so far it's referred to as ridge regression so

275
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,150
now what I want to show you is that that can now be

276
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,330
actually performed in a kernel defined feature space so this

277
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:15,950
is where we showing the power of the kernel method and how it can be used or this algorithm can be

278
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,410
used in combination with the kernel defined feature space

279
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:25,110
so okay the key idea is that you need a a so-called jewel

280
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:36,710
representation of that weight vector so instead of that explicit vector we are going to express the weight vector W as a linear combination of the

281
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,030
training data so we're gonna express the weight vector in terms of the

282
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,270
training data here is the expression that we're looking

283
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,000
at W is just a sum with weighting coefficients alpha rhi

284
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:55,790
of the training data now that's a you might say well how how do I know that's gonna be the case well in this

285
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,970
case we can actually write that down that equation that we

286
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:05,590
had for W and we can actually express W by taking this on

287
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,270
to the other side and dividing through by lambda we

288
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:20,850
express W in terms of these other terms in the equation and if we bring the factor X primed out front we see in fact W is

289
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:28,730
expressible as X primed time some vector which I'm denoting here alpha so alpha is just one

290
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:34,850
over lambda Y minus X W so we have okay it involves W but we've

291
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,090
shown that the solution does in facts lie in the span

292
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:44,590
of the training data by that manipulation well in a

293
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:51,310
sense that's almost a no brainer I mean in in because what we are doing is computing in a products with

294
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,680
hypothesis they say that well maybe on comparable to by let's try that and they

295
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,870
do chemistry experiment in the revised the hypothesis and so on but this also seems

296
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,690
like something which you could use active learning and that's what that's what these people

297
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:09,980
so in this setting each unlabelled point corresponds to potential compound and it turns out

298
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,790
that the chemist came up with a very high dim dimensional descriptions space for these

299
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:19,020
compounds was literally something like one hundred forty thousand dimensional some incredibly high dimensional where

300
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,310
it captures a lot of the chemically interesting features

301
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:28,720
each point is going to label either active it binds to the target or inactive

302
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,200
and and now the querying process actually corresponds to a chemistry experiment and so they

303
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,160
were able to

304
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:40,800
they were able to some sort of traction on this fairly difficult in problem

305
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,920
using their active learning method

306
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:51,850
here's another example this was from a pedestrian detection experiment that was conducted on the

307
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:58,190
streets of paris i believe in this is by yotam abramson in your freind and

308
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,750
q the setting was the

309
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,260
inside inside a car a camera was placed

310
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:10,060
taking you know images of the of the world in front and the idea was

311
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,250
was to find the pedestrians the hope was that you know this would eventually become

312
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:19,190
part of some cars software and make cars more safe for pedestrians

313
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,180
that kind of thing k so each data point in this case is not an

314
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,640
entire image but simply a rectangle within an image and these rectangles can be of

315
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,830
different sizes and the label is is that of pedestrian or not and using this

316
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,070
using active learning the world they were able to

317
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,640
avoid having to label too much of the data OK so you can collect masses

318
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,910
of data just by having the camera sitting there in your car but but it's

319
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,640
it's really laborious to have to label it so what they did is they developed

320
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,610
a system in which some human beings sat and looked at a whole bunch of

321
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,350
these images and drew boxes around the human beings and they came up with the

322
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:04,790
classifier that basically you know was able to correctly classify those examples anything that humans

323
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,500
had encircled was basically negative example so they were able to come up with the

324
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,580
classifier that with those examples and then

325
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,420
and then they went through some sort of refinement process

326
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,880
you know the classifier was then applied to whole bunch of other images and if

327
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,870
it if there was something was really unsure about human being was asked to label

328
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,330
that OK so for instance if there was something on the sidewalk that was like

329
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,370
a phone booth

330
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,450
maybe that's something the classifier will be unsure about or a fire hydrant

331
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,330
anyway so these are just two examples of

332
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,980
of active learning and it turns out that there's actually

333
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,800
a large number of

334
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,580
with active learning algorithms out there

335
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,870
which which have already enjoyed a certain amount of success

336
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,850
and in some sense you know

337
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,240
since it's in mencap occasions it's really needed to you

338
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,630
you know you have to use something and so on

339
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:04,650
so the whole sort of a collection of of active learning strategies has emerged

340
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,870
and so

341
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,500
i'll start by talking about a certain class of these strategies and and then and

342
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,940
then talk about

343
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,510
what happens when we when we try and get some sort of basic statistical guarantees

344
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,840
for these kinds of algorithms what what what turns out to be the hurt

345
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,130
OK so so there's a lot of strategies to look like this have a bunch

346
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,600
of very natural sort of thing have a bunch of unlabeled points in you start

347
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,480
by just choosing a bunch of them at random to get labels for just to

348
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:39,330
sort of get the lay of the land and once you have that

349
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:44,230
then you do have some sort of candidate or you have some idea of where

350
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,420
the decision boundary is going to be because you have some sort of candidate boundary

351
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,340
and want to look at that boundary you can then

352
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,340
you know decide well you know the point i should queries is the one i'm

353
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,990
most uncertain about there's no point wearing this one since i know exactly what is

354
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,420
going to be so why not choose something near the boundary

355
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,910
OK so there are strategies that for instance

356
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,790
look for the point closest to the boundary

357
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,700
which in this case would be say this one

358
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:18,460
this variant that might look for the most uncertain point where for instance the distance

359
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,380
from the boundary might trends the transformed into some sort of posterior probabilities and in

360
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,590
that case this might also be the most uncertain point

361
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,960
there are some variations in in which the consideration is that well

362
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,000
and although this might be closest to the boundary it's kind of far away from

363
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,540
the other data and so maybe a better point to pick is one of these

364
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:47,610
because if you have the label it would most influence

365
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:55,070
it would it would lead to the largest update it would most influence your your

366
00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:00,750
classifications of the other examples OK so rather than simply being the most uncertain point

367
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,710
it's the most likely to change too or to shrink the overall amount of uncertainty

368
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,490
and there are various ways to formalize this

369
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,730
OK so there's a large class of

370
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,970
heuristics in this form

371
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,120
and actually it seems to me this seems like a very sort of sensible strategy

372
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,070
but there's one sort of basic difficulty that emerges and so let me let me

373
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,150
just outline what that is

374
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,150
basically in you know in this sort of setting we want to come up with

375
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:39,320
the classifier that does well on the natural distribution out there

376
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,500
you know the underlying distribution from which we have a few samples

377
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,790
so in the first step of this process we have chosen a few random points

378
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:52,200
we've got the labels and the labelled points we have because they are chosen randomly

379
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,480
truly represent the underlying distribution

380
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,320
a random sample from the underlying distribution

381
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:05,030
once you start the active learning process however as time goes on the training sample

382
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,510
the i minus one and two

383
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,800
the i

384
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,990
view the

385
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,880
operation the structure is a mapping

386
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,940
mapping one structure to another data structure one from before the one after

387
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:25,010
they form already it's nicely mathematics

388
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,170
and of course the cost

389
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,920
of operation i

390
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:50,090
it means it CI

391
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,920
and now i really do

392
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,990
is defined

393
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,740
the potential functions

394
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:13,170
which means the set of data structures

395
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,340
into the rails

396
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,400
associated with every day structure now

397
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,920
is a

398
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,510
they are real valued

399
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,110
often in potential

400
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,320
such that

401
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,800
the d zero

402
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,960
it is equal to zero

403
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,150
so the initial potential is zero

404
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,970
and the CIA

405
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:56,280
it's great to equal to zero for all i potential can never be nonnegative just

406
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,280
like the bank account because the potential is essentially representing the bank account if you

407
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,200
in the

408
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,130
in the

409
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,760
accounting method

410
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,030
so we always want the potential to be

411
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,880
nonnegative now actually

412
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:17,030
there are time series potential functions we violate both of these properties

413
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:21,530
OK there's some really interesting potential arguments which don't violate this but for the kind

414
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,490
the simple ones were going to be doing

415
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,880
in this class will just assume that these tend to be true

416
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:31,610
but you may find the we will actually see sometimes where the zero isn't zero

417
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,340
but it doesn't matter

418
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,190
OK but generally this is where we're going

419
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:42,010
in the potential type of potential function argument there were doing

420
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,550
OK so i just want let you know that there are bigger and bigger space

421
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,170
of potential function arguments and the one give

422
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,670
showing here

423
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,530
OK so then under these circumstances

424
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,320
we define the advertised

425
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,690
i have

426
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,150
with respect to

427
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,690
as this is one of these formulas that you

428
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,900
stay within your budget

429
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,100
so there was code one hand we have some other ideas

430
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,750
it was code number

431
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,560
was the selection that we made

432
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,460
where was it

433
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:33,790
code to

434
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,600
which doesn't go over budget but it didn't quite is that the whole budget and so noticed we could

435
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,290
make a change in soviet buying that there's a one

436
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,020
could right top

437
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,190
we could look of final one by

438
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,770
the there's are next door instead and then made expected length shorter which is good

439
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,770
and then we look this guy

440
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,370
it was my silly idea

441
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,690
sorry about the wonders on the one zero okay

442
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,080
and i went over budget

443
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,940
and it was a great labour find a proof that when that didn't work

444
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:14,350
we have to think about strings but now the kraft inequality we could demonstrate way up

445
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:20,580
no point even trying this thing it's violated kraft inequality so it can't be uniquely decodable

446
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,310
in blue there

447
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,130
we have to be optimal code

448
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,730
ant is

449
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,460
see seven which i want of

450
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,770
which is why we reverse the services is also uniquely decodable

451
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,370
and you can see the difference between the prefix code in blue

452
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,630
which is sort of sense walk through the supermarket from one side to the other

453
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,000
buying codewords that you were confused with each other

454
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,480
whereas the silly

455
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,310
back-to-front one

456
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,310
see six

457
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,650
bought one one zero one zero zero which are prefixes of each other and are on the same

458
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,620
why coordinate in this in this picture

459
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,230
all right

460
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,580
so that's the kraft inequality

461
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,500
gets right up to the budget that uses the full budget

462
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,900
we will call it complete

463
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,920
a complete code is one has some particular myself i

464
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,210
equal to

465
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,800
if you have chosen yourself a complete code he advises you can probably go back

466
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,810
to the supermarket makes switches and get yourself a shorter

467
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,080
code so is a bit silly not to use the complete code

468
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,270
all right

469
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,290
and as we observed easy to decode codes are prefix codes

470
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,810
let's address the practical

471
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,980
question or not the theoretical version very first practice

472
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,620
two five minutes on each

473
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,540
the theoretical question is how well can we do

474
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,040
symbol codes

475
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,770
so if i give you any ensemble

476
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,250
x and if you come up with the best symbol code by whatever methods

477
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,120
how small can expected length

478
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,540
the definition of the expected length is summarized he i

479
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,650
now i

480
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:39,540
i am

481
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,250
we're not going to show that whatever you do

482
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,040
with a simple code you can't be the entropy and will also identify what you

483
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,370
need to do in order to get

484
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,600
close to the entropy of all the way to the end

485
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:54,920
and it's all about

486
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,170
figure out what these expected length should be

487
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,920
let me give us

488
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,210
a clue

489
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,400
i'm going to define

490
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,730
the ideal

491
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,440
for codeword to be

492
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:12,790
ways to

493
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,650
one over the probability

494
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,170
thank goodness

495
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:17,520
so i'm gonna

496
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,460
introduces the definition

497
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,560
namely the shannon information content

498
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,460
so i say

499
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:28,420
for this thing which are very here namely the square or minus m squared is

500
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,940
given by some

501
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,730
over all the amplitudes of transverse oscillations of this thing absolute value squared summed over

502
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:43,160
all the frequencies and remember was the frequency of this way going around the string

503
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:48,330
and this is true for the left and for that i overstepped

504
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:55,120
one can go on to do similar calculations for the angular momentum one finds for

505
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,300
instance and they want do it here about that this being the angular momentum

506
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,160
is less than or equal to alpha prime m squared it can go up to

507
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,390
to alpha prime m squared for relativistic string

508
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:11,680
this is to be compared to an angular momentum which grows like square root of

509
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,790
the energy for a rigid bar

510
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:19,030
and actually this is the beginning of what you see these edge trajectories

511
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,680
now we don't want to spend too much time here on these

512
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,100
a classical a relativistic strings even though they may

513
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:33,790
play a role in nature as cosmic strings if cosmic strings exist out in the

514
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:41,270
and then they would have very similar properties to this classic relativistic strings but here

515
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:46,320
we are interested in quantum theory right now

516
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:50,880
he is you see that if i go back

517
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,030
the mass

518
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:57,760
like all all other properties of this classical strings are continuous but that's of course

519
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:05,610
natural because the amplitudes are arbitrated continuous parameters here but of course elementary particles have

520
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:11,590
a discrete spectrum of masses in spin and everything else and

521
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,000
this will be automatic upon quantization so quantization first of all it is important

522
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:21,600
because we don't want continues must parameters for our elementary particles they have to be

523
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,770
discrete and that's of course and automatic and quantum theory you know

524
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:33,470
now in practice the way this works is that this amplitude of oscillation squared with

525
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:39,670
appropriate normalisation becomes simply numbers of excitation in the same way that the amplitude of

526
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,700
the electromagnetic wave

527
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,780
becomes in the quantum theory number of photons

528
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:50,940
well in the same way this amplitudes of oscillation are traded by integer numbers of

529
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:58,070
excitations running around this training this will automatically k take care of the discretisation of

530
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,930
these various quantum numbers

531
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,820
what looks harder at first

532
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:09,860
is how to obtain massless particles after all we want this theory to describe photons

533
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:15,100
and gravitons and everything else and if you look at the expression of the previous

534
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:20,740
page it was a positive definite mass squared as you would expect for a relativistic

535
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,820
strings so how on earth what's interesting describe massless particles

536
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:31,880
well this is what get quantum mechanics comes to the rescue nice beautiful way

537
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:37,680
it quantum strain has got out of the ground state energy which could be negative

538
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:44,810
and you can actually compute these very easily what is the this is given by

539
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:50,310
so remember to gain for those of you that a

540
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,960
no this expressions from QED we have here in my squared which would have been

541
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,600
which is given by the sum

542
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,820
of later amplitude square the

543
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:10,190
the classical theory and the quantum theories has become operators they have nontrivial commutation relations

544
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,970
and that is the ground state energy it has energy which comes from the ordering

545
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:19,750
of additional predators and which is simply given by the sum over all frequencies of

546
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,890
the field the one half its bottleneck right that the ground state energy of quantum

547
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:32,070
oscillator when you summit over all frequencies that the ground state energy for quantum field

548
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:35,780
so we just do the same here you know it's one half of the frequencies

549
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:42,440
and have to sum over all land and there are d minus two transverse oscillators

550
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,140
these the dimension of the string

551
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,130
and when you calculate the sum you find minus the over minus two over twenty

552
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:55,200
four basically this infinite sum is minus one of twenty four now you may well

553
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,400
be about these

554
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:02,360
being nonsense how and if it's some minus one of twenty four obviously there's visiting

555
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:10,440
normalisation here namely this quantum fluctuations of the string create an infinite block of energy

556
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,260
density that we have to stop doctor away very much like in the corresponding calculation

557
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,790
of the cosmic force

558
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:24,750
however this subtraction is thought only an ambiguous and the reason is purely dimensionality

559
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:28,100
if we introduce a small part of epsilon

560
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:33,400
to cut off the short distance fluctuations of this training this up fraction of the

561
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,350
energy density can only be proportional to one over actual square there's not the scale

562
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:44,100
around and is uniquely defined for you this number which is minus one of twenty

563
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,220
now that's a bit upsetting because it means that the mass squared off the ground

564
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,860
state the first thing is negative actually if these more than two

565
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,460
and this is called the vacuum

566
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:05,860
so this is this thing in its ground state it has negative mass squared if

567
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:11,650
we think about the first excited states well they correspond to exciting the lowest possible

568
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:15,460
frequency of waves the lowest frequencies one

569
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:20,680
so you are applying one of these raising operators one for the very first for

570
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,780
frequency minus one and and these have been mass which is one minus minus two

571
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,550
over twenty four but you see these are not articles vector particles they have the

572
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:39,780
sure because they have this index j which points around in transverse

573
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:48,050
direction directions now the only massless particles that we know which have only transverse polarization

574
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:54,200
physical states are the massless particles and therefore if this theory is to be at

575
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:00,090
all consistent with this first excited states better be massless and if you check what

576
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:05,280
this tells you this tells you that dimension can only be twenty six

577
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:10,160
so this is the place where you see the first characteristic features of string theory

578
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,370
critical dimension to the dimension cannot be anything it has to be twenty six and

579
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:22,760
it actually on excitation plus muscle estates which are quite an unintuitive from the point

580
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,820
of view of classical

581
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:30,280
theory but which are of varying the quantum mechanics

582
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:35,410
other than the states if you think about the the remaining states they all have

583
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,700
positive mass

584
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,730
that gives me

585
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,410
i can help it

586
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,240
seven percent error

587
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,850
so i have a seven percent uncertainty

588
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,850
multiply by point o seven

589
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:49,110
i cannot trust this any better

590
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,990
and thirty seven centimetres

591
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,710
so now i'm going to put the markers out

592
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:59,880
five metres and thirty one centimeters

593
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,450
this is the five metre mark

594
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,850
thirty one centimeters

595
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:09,730
and i love for thirty seven centimetres on either side

596
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,430
it's here

597
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,710
and thirty seven centimetres on this site

598
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,000
that is you

599
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:23,890
going to set the angle of thirty degrees

600
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,860
i have a

601
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,720
we need a woman power

602
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,000
state here

603
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,590
stay out of the fire line

604
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,560
and when the ball hits

605
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,460
jump on it jump on it

606
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,910
everything under control

607
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:46,600
five make sure market right five meters three one that looks about OK

608
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,890
and now i have to

609
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,480
change the angle to thirty degrees

610
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:03,690
as close as i can do it

611
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,990
you are

612
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:24,630
the things are called

613
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,980
what you can argue now

614
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,170
and successfully

615
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,440
you could say perhaps you have been a little bit too conservative

616
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,970
on the other i admit that

617
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,520
but believe me when i did this morning despite six times at the error in

618
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,620
the zero

619
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,640
it was quite substantially high differences were sometimes fifteen centimeters

620
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,450
and so i had no choice

621
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,130
but it look like we were a bit

622
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,740
on the conservative side

623
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,490
suppose now i repeated this experiment

624
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,120
at sixty degrees

625
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:04,260
what will change

626
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,660
what will change

627
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,450
OS change

628
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,110
no because the size of hundred twenty degrees is the same as the sign

629
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,550
sixty degrees

630
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,990
you have to offer you

631
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,950
the final sixty is the same as the science

632
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,170
one hundred twenty

633
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,790
if you allow for uncertainty

634
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,890
one degree on decide

635
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,200
you'll find exactly the same numbers

636
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,390
because of the symmetry of the sine curve

637
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,140
so again you're of by two percent

638
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,610
no difference

639
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:40,740
so this prediction is unchanged

640
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:44,540
however i want to ask you one question to see whether you are

641
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,760
half alert or half-asleep

642
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,890
at thirty degrees

643
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,960
so this

644
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:57,180
at sixty degrees giving it the same initial speed

645
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,770
you will see this

646
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,750
it will have to it

647
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,840
here within the uncertainty of our measurements at the same location

648
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,990
it will of course

649
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,060
of course go much higher

650
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,790
you can calculate that

651
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:15,010
because you have to use this forty equation for the height

652
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,550
that goes with the sign of all

653
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,210
sign of of four for sixty degrees is way higher than thirty degrees

654
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,280
now comes the question

655
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:26,260
real this trajectory

656
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,810
take longer

657
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,210
then this one

658
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,500
or will they take the same amount of time

659
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,470
was for the same amount of time

660
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,180
it was for long

661
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,180
which for short

662
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,930
i'm happy with

663
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:51,170
one set of fingers and unhappy with another set of fingers

664
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,360
what is the horizontal velocity

665
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,320
of the golf balls

666
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,420
when it takes off

667
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,130
if the velocity is the same

668
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,380
in both cases

669
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:09,750
that this horizontal component is way larger than this horizontal component

670
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,150
and if they travel the same distance

671
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,100
then this trip must take longer

672
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:21,560
because it's the horizontal component in the x erection that determines how long it will

673
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,900
take to go from here

674
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,850
suppose i shall it's straight out how long do you think it will take to

675
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:32,250
hits here

676
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,900
it has no horizontal component

677
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:35,700
all right

678
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,920
think about this this trajectory will take longer

679
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,190
but it ends up at the same point

680
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,540
all right

681
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,230
number three

682
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,910
you come here

683
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,640
so i don't have to change these markers

684
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,910
they are perfect

685
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:57,070
provided that nature is willing to reproduce itself

686
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:04,990
sixty degrees

687
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,990
so we'll go away high

688
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,780
but if all goes well

689
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,530
it two hit

690
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:13,860
within the same marks

691
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,130
you're right

692
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:27,970
thank you very much wonderful look

693
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:30,510
many by uncertainties were not so

694
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:33,800
that we were lucky was the jackpot

695
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,220
comfortably was in the area

696
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,010
close to this one so i'm quite happy

697
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:42,190
that i took the certain because the way i did

698
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,670
can we recover the ball that someone see it

699
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,550
think of you

700
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,050
all right

701
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,420
now we will

702
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:53,950
enter different parts

703
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,880
of this lecture

704
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,220
which is actually

705
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:08,340
very sad parts

706
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,090
you know the people in africa

707
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:15,740
should monkeys

708
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:26,780
there's a monkey unitary

709
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:32,380
very happy

710
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:38,110
and here is the hunter

711
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,210
will never took a to one

712
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:44,860
he has a

713
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,760
a gun which is a golf ball gone

714
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:52,940
any aims that go

715
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,210
right at the

716
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,760
he shoots it with a certain velocity

717
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,860
the golf balls

718
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,050
this b

719
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,610
the horizontal component

720
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,590
going to see that again and again

721
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,300
the zero cosine of

722
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,900
and the vertical component

723
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,940
equals the zero

724
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,940
sign of

725
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,110
this b

726
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,920
by increasing value of y

727
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:31,860
this be my increasing value

728
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:39,860
this global this this goal of god

729
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,910
the set of all theorems of the logic

730
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:45,930
one possible definition

731
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:48,830
let's look at

732
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,830
this definition for this model logic

733
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,060
so model logic model came

734
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,150
we find

735
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,110
as set of theorems generated in the following way

736
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:07,640
all instances of propositional tautologies k

737
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:13,330
and all instances of this true more axioms theorems

738
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,420
we just had made it

739
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,600
this is just syntactic

740
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,480
so no meanings attached to a particular form

741
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,090
we just say that we have a bunch of false positive way to generate and

742
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:27,240
more fun

743
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:31,260
anything that can be generated this way which is called an hearing

744
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:36,710
and the principle of minus one in

745
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:41,770
after at implies she is she is here

746
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,440
and the the substitution principle

747
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,440
in g

748
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:49,340
his appearance and it is obtained from g by

749
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,320
uniformly families

750
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,670
for the last

751
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,410
and this principle of generalisation

752
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:05,890
she is here and then box g

753
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,730
so this is the syntactic where you define

754
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,790
now again come back to this notion of syntax and semantics

755
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:19,260
the questions we ask is whether

756
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,910
all the appearance generated this way out of the different

757
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:34,440
is every valid formula here in k they every form found from can be generated

758
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:37,600
following syntactic procedures

759
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,660
and the second year

760
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:46,980
for this model logic k a systematic procedure show the form

761
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,810
we were not discussed here

762
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,410
again this is this

763
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,400
we introduce the syntax and semantics

764
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,330
and then once we define k we can define

765
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:08,060
the whole family of models you just extending k with some more action

766
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:11,710
so this is usually called no more

767
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,900
most if not all logics using AI

768
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,590
it was a normal modal logic

769
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,860
including his term

770
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:26,090
logics using agency staff

771
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:32,250
so would not not a normal modal logic is defined k with a set of

772
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,340
seven years

773
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:38,870
this extension

774
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,820
it is defined as

775
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,870
except that you had

776
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,180
o point you at all

777
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:52,140
axioms that you're standing

778
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:56,520
some standard access

779
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,810
i just this

780
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:05,130
so there's actually team box like or people

781
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:08,920
which we already

782
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,930
which character well

783
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,950
and there is actually a

784
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,140
x four

785
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,140
diamond dogs by the

786
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:31,560
what why

787
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:36,390
i just called the logic that extends came

788
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,360
OK and putting action

789
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,680
for example

790
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:44,120
OK to form a larger

791
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,150
is obtained by adding to k

792
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,920
p four

793
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,930
this axiom is actually

794
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:59,270
corresponds the shape of right

795
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,950
for example

796
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:02,660
is found

797
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:05,850
the knowledge

798
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:10,560
days of the war

799
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:15,820
we have is related to itself

800
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:20,500
and now what's interesting is that

801
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,700
his car goes both ways

802
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:27,850
it flexes his muscles

803
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:33,220
so the the model action actually characterised precise class frames

804
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,430
for which their

805
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,260
friends reflects

806
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,180
after all this data itself

807
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,080
the next thing

808
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,810
he was related to the

809
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:51,130
the reason

810
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,690
our in our

811
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:01,700
practically is just

812
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:05,560
every feature points in the ground this

813
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,730
is related to a

814
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,580
in the first

815
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,700
so are to

816
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:37,340
that's right

817
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,900
yes and no

818
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,190
i mean because

819
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,770
we end up here

820
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:50,390
metric is also

821
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:51,750
in our going from

822
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:59,440
there's always a successor

823
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:06,350
now the correspondences

824
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,770
correspond to let's train

825
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,730
from the semantic frames

826
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:15,060
or vice versa

827
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,750
by we need

828
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:20,580
again we

829
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,060
for the correspond

830
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:26,810
three classes of frames

831
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,040
for example

832
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,520
another incompressible when you decrease the volume

833
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,850
of the gas

834
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,150
by fifty percent that's no problem

835
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,880
it's impossible to do that

836
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,990
four liquid

837
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,450
in liquids the atoms and molecules

838
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:47,630
effectively touch each other whereas in gases they are very far apart that's why you

839
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,310
compress the gas

840
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:52,570
if you take everyone one atmosphere

841
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:53,840
the density

842
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,140
thousand times less

843
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,200
then the density of water

844
00:54:58,210 --> 00:54:59,800
it tells you is that the

845
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:04,050
much further apart

846
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:05,880
there's an experimental facts

847
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:09,660
that there is a simple relation

848
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:12,090
mean the pressure that you see there

849
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,990
the volume of the gas

850
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,160
the temperature of the gas in degrees kelvin

851
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,340
and the number of molecules that you have

852
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,850
now when you see the word molecules i may often mean atoms i realize that

853
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,280
kryptonite and i on

854
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,890
i atomic gases

855
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:31,080
and that

856
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:33,250
o two and h two n c o two

857
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:39,450
well actually gases so i'll use that word molecules even when i mean atoms and

858
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:41,420
maybe vice-versa

859
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,940
just four

860
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,500
relation that exists

861
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,670
between these quantities

862
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,730
he calls and rt

863
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,840
four volume

864
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,840
is the number

865
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,890
of moles

866
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:04,220
i'll get back to that

867
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:07,470
are is the universal gas constant

868
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:10,140
which is a point three

869
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,420
o degree kelvin

870
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,500
and t must be

871
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,300
in degrees kelvin

872
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:21,360
so what is more

873
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,590
the more

874
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,940
has always about six point zero two

875
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,020
times ten to the

876
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:29,190
twenty three

877
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,520
adams in the case that you have

878
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,730
you call it molecules

879
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:38,240
and this number

880
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:46,520
it's called advogato is not

881
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,930
that's the definition

882
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,450
a more

883
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:55,230
if you take a model of helium or more of oxygen or sio two n

884
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,120
two doesn't matter

885
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:58,520
always has

886
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,760
this number

887
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:02,640
small molecules approximately

888
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:05,450
now each of these substances

889
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:07,770
very different masses

890
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,360
if i take for instance

891
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:16,420
then one mole of carbon would be very close to twelve grams

892
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:17,510
if i take

893
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,600
one mole of helium

894
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:23,300
very close to fourgrams

895
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,890
and if i took

896
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:27,010
oxygen two o two

897
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,650
then one mole

898
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:31,800
would be very close to fifty grams thirty two gram so

899
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:35,300
masses are very different in the mall

900
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:41,550
but not the number of molecules or the number of atoms

901
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,330
when i take a neutral atoms

902
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:48,080
then we have the nucleus

903
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,580
in the nucleus

904
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:51,510
contains protons and

905
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:55,330
it has z protons

906
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,670
and it has and neutron

907
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:02,740
protons are positively charged

908
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,670
and has the electrons

909
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,100
it is a neutral

910
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:12,790
there's almost no weight in the electrons you can almost ignore everything is into protons

911
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,020
and in the neutrons

912
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:17,980
and plus z

913
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:20,390
it's called

914
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:25,240
eight and that's called the atomic mass number

915
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,400
let's look at

916
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:31,700
carbon in a little bit more detail

917
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:33,080
we have carbon

918
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:36,800
and i call it carbon twelve finale doshi shortly y

919
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:41,820
carbon has always six protons in the nucleus otherwise it is card

920
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,630
what it has six neutrons

921
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:50,840
then eight twelve that's why we call the carbon twelve

922
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:52,440
so the atomic

923
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,610
mass number of carbon is twelve

924
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,250
but if you had for instance

925
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:59,160
carbon fourteen which happens to be radioactive

926
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:03,410
again six six protons otherwise it wouldn't be carbon would have eight

927
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,230
neutrons now

928
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:08,230
and now you would have atomic mass number

929
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,920
would be fourteen

930
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,610
the mall

931
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,900
is this numbering grounds

932
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,480
so you see carbon

933
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,170
is the

934
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:22,500
atomic mass number ingram you twelve

935
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:23,860
if you go to helium

936
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:27,850
two protons and two neutrons

937
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,880
so is for this very senior fourgrams

938
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,910
if you take oxygen

939
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,550
eight protons

940
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,170
eight neutrons

941
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:39,210
so is sixteen but you have o two gas for

942
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:42,730
so now you atomic mass number has to be doubled thirty two

943
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,570
so in a more of

944
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:48,490
o two is there for thirty two grams

945
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,350
i got always number is defined

946
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,300
through carbon twelve

947
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,680
if you take twelve grams

948
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,570
of carbon twelve

949
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,490
if you count the number of atoms that you have

950
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:04,860
then you find exactly avocados number that's the definition of the number and that's very

951
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,090
so what we have there

952
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:15,900
six point zero two times ten to the twenty third

953
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:19,980
the mass of the proton and the mass of the neutron

954
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:21,550
nearly all

955
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:26,480
i wrote down and tool for the mass of the neutron of course that should

956
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,310
have been more than

957
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:33,110
so the mass of the molecule

958
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,620
or whatever the case may be

959
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:36,490
it would be

960
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,730
this number eight

961
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:42,290
because that the some of the protons and neutrons times the mass of the neutrons

962
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,260
and protons

963
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:48,230
and so this is a time approximately i should put we here one point six

964
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:50,800
six times ten to the minus

965
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,690
twenty seven kilogram

966
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:58,530
there's no individual mass of either an atom or molecule and all the information you

967
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,910
have there and that's

968
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,660
of course on the web

969
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,360
so let's do a

970
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,670
trivial example

971
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,170
i take

972
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:13,930
gas is any kind of gas you choose whatever you want

973
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:17,600
and i take one atmosphere

974
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,740
so that means that the pressure

975
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:21,990
one zero three

976
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,290
times ten to the fifth moscow

977
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,490
i do it at room temperature

978
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:29,300
so t

979
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:32,420
two hundred ninety three degrees

980
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:37,910
and i take in all cases

981
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,180
only one model

982
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:42,070
so and this one

983
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,670
and i'm asking you know

984
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,360
what will be the volume of the gas

985
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,660
well you take the gas law

986
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:50,170
it tells you that

987
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:53,560
equals nrt

988
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:55,560
divided by p

989
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:57,930
you know and this one

990
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,910
you know i

991
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:00,360
there are

992
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,600
so scaling up and down weights doesn't change the place where

993
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:11,620
the activation is zero

994
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,290
which is where the red line

995
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,260
so i was playing with a single

996
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:26,870
now what we're gonna do next is going to about learning with a neural network consisting of just one neuron

997
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,030
learning means that you get yourself in data

998
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:37,620
and the data

999
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:40,330
takes the form of a set of input

1000
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,560
so the target specifies

1001
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,760
roughly what you want the neuron say all the neural network to say

1002
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:54,370
in response to

1003
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:55,340
the input

1004
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:58,110
and i have label

1005
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,550
and runs through

1006
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,830
and the idea of moving is that we just

1007
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,110
learning is just a silly name four

1008
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:11,750
the parameters

1009
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:18,570
that's that's

1010
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:21,760
the output of your neural network why

1011
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:23,910
when you show the accent

1012
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:31,290
after and

1013
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:35,110
floral at

1014
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:43,680
when someone says

1015
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:46,040
something like that happened

1016
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:50,080
what you'd say the the middle ground just tell me that the objective function plays

1017
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:53,240
an now minimize all the by get function

1018
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:56,230
which measures how good the weights are

1019
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,190
hand start off with energy is gonna have and turns into which measures how close

1020
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:08,710
to you is to why in my measure of closeness is gonna be

1021
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:36,020
why then is my shorthand four

1022
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:38,640
why don't children

1023
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:41,020
and a weight vector w

1024
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:44,830
okay so the w dependence lurks in why here

1025
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:46,720
and in this way

1026
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,460
this objective function is a sum of terms

1027
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,400
each which is the looks like this

1028
01:04:58,210 --> 01:04:59,070
or it looks like

1029
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,530
this depending whether the target

1030
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:04,740
the target

1031
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:05,790
is one

1032
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,420
if one matches the target

1033
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:10,010
the objective function given easier

1034
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,670
and if why doesn't match the target you penalty that increasingly big

1035
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,190
if there are few are

1036
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,230
you could think of gene has being

1037
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,710
thee information content of the data

1038
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,700
from the point-of-view of the neuron who

1039
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:36,040
views his output why as being the correct probability distribution for the data

1040
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:40,210
so it's the information content

1041
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:43,440
all the data are completely it is

1042
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:44,990
the description length

1043
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:50,770
of the data

1044
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,610
the view why

1045
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:01,080
as being

1046
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:03,330
the correct

1047
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,810
now when i said the data and being a bit imprecise what i mean is

1048
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,690
the set of students

1049
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:24,660
so if you if you've already been told where the data inputs what x is our

1050
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,890
and in some sense now i'm going to tell you that he's this is what

1051
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:30,640
the description length would be if used a perfect

1052
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:31,760
many coder

1053
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:36,290
or other compression methods to encode them using this neuron

1054
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,270
okay so

1055
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:46,430
show an example of this

1056
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,000
so is a single neuron and his and data

1057
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:56,900
the sort of data we could be talking about might be we're trying to run vegetable floating factory

1058
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:01,120
the pigeons are gone on strike because they realized how good they are compared to

1059
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:05,840
the computer and they will be paid the same wages supercomputers so now we're trying

1060
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:10,120
get a simple neuron to replace the pigeon

1061
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:16,070
job the pigeon is to sort the potatoes and carrots or the reasons from the petals or whatever doing

1062
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:20,950
got some labelled data so we measured x one and x two for ten objects

1063
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:24,560
five and them were raisins and five foot pedals

1064
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,300
okay so the classes are

1065
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:27,270
coloured there

1066
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,370
so we know what class

1067
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:30,980
each other ten things in

1068
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:32,810
because x one connects to

1069
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:36,560
and what i showed you in this input space x one x two is how

1070
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,560
neuron can produce a function that

1071
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,010
is u around

1072
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,330
soft sigmoid ramp

1073
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:51,180
so what is learning learning is minimizing an objective function like this with respect to w

1074
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:59,240
what does that's involved well if you're a sensible minimizing things you'll say

1075
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,370
it is easy to compute the gradient

1076
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,680
and the answer is yes it's easy to compute the gradient

1077
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,200
so you get the gradient

1078
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:08,770
look like gene

1079
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:09,990
which is the energy

1080
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:11,890
by w

1081
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:15,410
and then you do some sensible downhill

1082
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:17,580
thing based on the gradient

1083
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:21,850
be very simplest thing you could do with gradient is called gradient descent

1084
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:24,810
that's not a sensible thing to do because it doesn't

1085
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:31,080
the sort of co-variance that you'd like appropriate treatment

1086
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:33,990
vector spaces and their duals

1087
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,950
this mixes up vector spaces their dual which is a crime

1088
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:39,490
but lots of people do it

1089
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:41,810
so you just look at the gradient

1090
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,660
many say let's make a step in the direction of the gradient

1091
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:46,560
so that's gradient descent

1092
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:48,470
hand this

1093
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:49,580
parameter here

1094
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,470
is by neural network people called the learning rate

1095
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,750
and that's an ad hoc parameter that you have to set somehow

1096
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:01,520
it's fairly easy to

1097
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:05,930
and this is left as a homework exercise

1098
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:09,290
that's the gradient can be written as the sum over all of these

1099
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:10,870
the examples

1100
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,640
of t-minus why

1101
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:17,840
well there are cases where it's not the PRD software actually gets to make this

1102
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:22,450
the task is quite clearly world

1103
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,110
estimates y given x

1104
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:27,470
just some loss is minimized obviously

1105
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:30,260
you could have something like a squared loss and then you just take the difference

1106
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,300
between the two values square

1107
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,990
let's say we're talking about money

1108
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:38,700
and i care about the actual difference between the value that i was going to

1109
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,880
try and

1110
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,360
and the value that

1111
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:45,720
having estimated so it may not necessarily be a square loss it may be a

1112
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,570
loss of some kind

1113
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:51,220
while this might be really nice and easy to implement

1114
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:55,620
don't automatically assume that this is the right thing

1115
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,930
just a cautionary tales at the end of the day

1116
01:09:57,950 --> 01:10:00,890
ask whoever as to solve this problem

1117
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:05,610
this regression problem what they really think is called

1118
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:10,140
that might look at the very surprised

1119
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:13,840
you might want to go into and string

1120
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,880
for instance i might want to find out

1121
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:18,720
what to

1122
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,380
chances are that the g

1123
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,030
four and a year

1124
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:24,820
it's just some sequence

1125
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,990
you might want to annotate all you

1126
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:31,660
so this is what happened with the

1127
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:34,910
telstra speech recogniser a couple of years ago

1128
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,390
have you got any australian here like native-born australians

1129
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,050
can you read

1130
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:45,880
this one and case that one if possible in

1131
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:48,910
mister howard's accent

1132
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:52,890
because this is basically what happened they part of this feature is right speech recognition

1133
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:55,200
on how mister howard was saying it

1134
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:58,160
and this high pass

1135
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:07,640
you can see why the speech recogniser had quite of trouble

1136
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,970
novelty detection

1137
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:15,260
so you

1138
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:18,010
could have things like network use it happened

1139
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:19,720
and with digital

1140
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,430
well i think that's a factory status

1141
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:24,490
we want to find out

1142
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:28,430
whether something so is going wrong in the factory where the jet engines blowing up

1143
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:29,620
with a

1144
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,800
let's say you're putting in some control system for

1145
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:37,260
a chemical plant well obviously you cannot just go and blow it up in all

1146
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,410
possible ways in order to figure out how to

1147
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:43,160
what normal parameters of operation are

1148
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:47,950
what you want to have a system that automatically takes when things are going strange

1149
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:49,800
like was project in the mean

1150
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:52,180
it will be quite costly

1151
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:56,680
so the idea would be well you might want to find unusual events

1152
01:11:56,700 --> 01:12:00,450
you might want to clean database let's say for instance somebody just insert garbage into

1153
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:01,910
the database

1154
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:05,820
you might actually also want to find some very typical observations

1155
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:10,780
so it's a bit similar to clustering but not quite so clustering as well find

1156
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,550
me prototype

1157
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:16,840
here it's will find me typical observations they could be that there's only one really

1158
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,530
typical use

1159
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:24,120
as you can see it's this is not very straightforward problem it's a good start

1160
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,680
then i could for instance claimed that those points out here are a bit more

1161
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:32,280
or especially if i have these points here

1162
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:35,340
could say well you know those are really unusual

1163
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,530
and maybe those are the boundary two

1164
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:43,220
or maybe only the ones at the boundary everything in the centuries to difficult come

1165
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,780
something like that

1166
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:50,070
it depends very much on how you specify your problem

1167
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:50,990
so i

1168
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:54,800
finding a new observation is not an easy thing i mean even so you can

1169
01:12:54,890 --> 01:13:00,550
easily derive bounds in those bonds would work for any of those cases

1170
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:03,570
asking the question is actually the heartbeat here

1171
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,430
once you've as well

1172
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:09,700
solving is just happily optimizing away

1173
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:14,780
i'll be quick on this because i think it's going to be controversial

1174
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:19,450
so i think machine learning and logic differently two different things

1175
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:24,260
it would be very nice if we could actually merge those two things inefficiently what

1176
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,300
efficient way but

1177
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,910
i think we're not quite there yet

1178
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:33,240
i'm also not trying to the artificial intelligence

1179
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,260
this is

1180
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:38,780
i mean what and what i'm going to talk about is one of the building

1181
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:42,800
blocks that you might want to use it but it's definitely not a i

1182
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,590
and it's also not the response in biology

1183
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:50,680
this is one of the traps that people fell into in the eighties

1184
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,030
sometimes even now they say it once in a while you hear the story OK

1185
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:57,010
we know how we can

1186
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:59,680
well the system that simulates the brain

1187
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:04,660
we now know how to build intelligent system

1188
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,530
this is something that is usually

1189
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:11,220
the reasoning made by people who got the big research grant on building a huge

1190
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:13,300
machine that can simulate the brain

1191
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:16,970
and you see a press release on that

1192
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,070
version is

1193
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:25,380
well i have found the really cool machine learning algorithm behaves in an intelligent way

1194
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:28,180
therefore the brain must work like this

1195
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:30,030
problematic things

1196
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:35,130
the ZBDD is zero suppressed binary decision diagrams

1197
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,160
i think it's

1198
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:40,970
i forgot the office them bright

1199
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,700
right or something you know you can look at

1200
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:45,130
on the

1201
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:46,670
on the internet

1202
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:50,950
this is they think this is probably the most important contribution in the whole of

1203
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:52,060
computer science

1204
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,340
some people would say

1205
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:55,250
why why that is

1206
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:59,190
because it seems to be useful

1207
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:07,270
you know doing any complex computationally complex problems this data structure is a very useful

1208
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:12,300
how many of you know could

1209
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,840
does anyone know

1210
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:16,110
that is anyone who doesn't know

1211
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,340
if a computer scientist should know

1212
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:26,310
but the is a professor from stanford he is it probably the best books

1213
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:29,800
on algorithms and computation as a result

1214
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:34,040
so you know his goal was to write

1215
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:36,010
for computer science

1216
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:39,410
and then after reading three books then he realized that

1217
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:43,860
this is much much harder problem because science doesn't stop

1218
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,280
because you want to write about

1219
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,330
and then he but there are fantastic plastic machine we're all

1220
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,420
one of those today

1221
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:56,260
you know i would be surprised the wealth of information that is there

1222
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:58,550
but anyway he's the guy who wrote

1223
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:03,810
you know what you take because you want to write the next any thought this

1224
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:08,370
is rubbish not four types because they want all the good master do

1225
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,170
so he's impact is just phenomenal you know text is written by the guy

1226
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:16,990
and then he saw tatego he writes all nodes all the kinds of bugs

1227
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:21,410
he made and you know the program and how he fix

1228
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:24,000
but the point i was trying to say is now he's writing a book on

1229
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:28,610
and you want to call them

1230
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:29,910
and you want to

1231
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,050
drop the word binary i think you want to call it z

1232
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:37,830
zero suppressed binary decision diagram he thinks is one of the best one so he

1233
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,700
about four hundred forty pages of discussion

1234
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:45,340
you know when document could attract hundred forty probably you you and i will be

1235
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:47,820
writing pages

1236
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,670
so he's very concise no sentence

1237
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:52,100
would be

1238
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:57,050
you know read everything you if you lose one sentence that means you lost

1239
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,270
the plot

1240
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:01,800
so he's a very good writer and he has written in one hundred forty pages

1241
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,020
so usually

1242
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:08,370
you know then exercise he would give you know you put one time is difficult

1243
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:10,700
to start needs to be able to pieces

1244
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:13,070
three stars means probably turing award

1245
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:14,540
if you saw

1246
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:18,270
so he's writing a book on the so so maybe

1247
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:20,140
a lot of pretty soon

1248
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:24,640
OK what is you know you know this big cat thing i want to say

1249
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:27,300
too much for so you have to go warn read

1250
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,120
so typically this is how

1251
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:33,110
binary decision diagrams are written

1252
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:36,780
suppose that you given a boolean expression c and

1253
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:38,150
or DNA

1254
01:17:38,210 --> 01:17:42,460
so basically what you're doing is that you're encoding this

1255
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,750
drawing a picture like that so

1256
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,230
so this is basically a truth table driven is the tree

1257
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:51,300
you know what it truth able right

1258
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:52,720
you build the true

1259
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:56,800
i give all possible combinations and then if the expression is true

1260
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:00,050
the truth value one otherwise

1261
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:00,960
OK so

1262
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,920
so here

1263
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:06,250
it's equal to one so let's go through these and see if sequel to one

1264
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,760
and equal to one

1265
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:11,020
then we don't care what this is that that is the true

1266
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:15,400
or if c is false that means this expression doesn't play any role

1267
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:17,270
then we have to rely on this road

1268
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:19,960
so you come here if d is true

1269
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:23,970
and if it is true then is one all of the branches must before

1270
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:28,040
so basically we encode the truth table by tree and then you can compress that

1271
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:31,300
in this form so you can you can have its implementation

1272
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:38,310
simply saying that the unfortunate that we can see here can you see solid line

1273
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,570
so anyway when you see the slides so

1274
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:45,260
so typically you know that now

1275
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:49,280
come on

1276
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,840
OK it's not responding to my thing

1277
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:57,160
OK so

1278
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,570
the c to d

1279
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:00,620
is a daughter

1280
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:04,730
OK and c two a is the solid lines

1281
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:10,020
so so basically we compress this into into this form and you can see that

1282
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:15,760
a lot of showing is taking place the first thing is that is the canonical

1283
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:17,820
directed acyclic graph

1284
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:23,570
representing bullion from let's node sharing means identical nodes are shared if there's any sub

1285
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:28,220
branches shared the new share it says that compressed stream some sense

1286
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:34,900
so the idea here is that you can use caching that means past computations

1287
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:40,450
i'll get back to you although you may not need

1288
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:42,920
so we now have the

1289
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:46,860
two opening all the way on the left

1290
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:52,520
they are so close together this is the screen close so close together

1291
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:55,890
can be separated what this is the point with the

1292
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:58,570
one of the things i

1293
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:00,950
and we are going to look

1294
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:03,490
on the screen which is far away

1295
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:10,230
there's is a screen which is going to be that screen

1296
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,190
and we want to see

1297
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:17,700
all the constructive interference it means light shows up on the screen and how desperate

1298
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:21,810
to the darkness shows up on that street

1299
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:25,680
so here it is two openings light comes in from the left

1300
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:29,670
and that this this is BLP

1301
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:30,510
and so

1302
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:35,620
i want to know if i look on angle data

1303
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:37,280
seen from

1304
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:39,530
i want to know

1305
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:44,050
kind of that and i will see

1306
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:47,040
let's call this actually equals zero

1307
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:53,320
and we call this x positive action that's negative

1308
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:57,410
you can also say that the sign of data if you want that

1309
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:01,010
it is approximately x divided by albert that's only true

1310
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:03,800
four small angle theta

1311
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:08,110
and with this kind of interference we sometimes have angles of data

1312
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:09,940
which are not small

1313
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,950
i want to warn you that this is not something you can use universally they'll

1314
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:17,800
we can use it

1315
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,660
so i started now

1316
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:23,810
red light land

1317
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:26,640
six hundred nanometer

1318
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:33,550
that's the light i will use so i use monochromatic light

1319
01:21:33,610 --> 01:21:36,040
and we will have the distance

1320
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:36,820
to the

1321
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:40,260
three which is about five hours

1322
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:43,250
the set is here this is about five metres

1323
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,620
and we have right light from the red laser

1324
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:49,590
which is a little larger than six hundred nanometers but i just one

1325
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:52,040
right now numbers

1326
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:54,950
and the separation here the

1327
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:56,610
between the two slits

1328
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,270
is one quarter of a million

1329
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:05,920
now you may think that is rather small well you see that that's what you

1330
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:08,770
you need a very small values

1331
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:09,740
one of the

1332
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:13,060
two even see this phenomenon

1333
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:19,110
what and this

1334
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:22,030
let's evaluate that is

1335
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,860
let's evaluate what the sign is

1336
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,230
of theta alpha

1337
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,440
and then we will

1338
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,630
evaluate of x of and is

1339
01:22:30,670 --> 01:22:33,040
and we'll do that for

1340
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,270
constructive interference

1341
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:38,130
numbers that you're going to see here

1342
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:39,400
this will construct

1343
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:45,460
and of course if you want to you can do the same exercise for desperate

1344
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,910
i need constructive interference

1345
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,920
so i have to turn

1346
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:55,860
that's and i make them and times

1347
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:58,120
and i start with an equal zero

1348
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:00,050
well that's easy and is zero

1349
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:04,580
delta zero sign theta and is zero and axl

1350
01:23:04,630 --> 01:23:07,320
that's where you will see maximum light

1351
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,690
constructive interference obviously

1352
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:11,030
that's the plane

1353
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:15,460
that goes right through the middle of those two opening and the distance

1354
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,340
each one of those sources everywhere in the plane

1355
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,870
it is of course the same so you expect here

1356
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:25,870
it seems like next

1357
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,480
now i don't plus minus one

1358
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:35,730
and i calculate now delta is then i got plus and minus two pi

1359
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,090
so to sign

1360
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:40,300
now two point four times ten to the minus three

1361
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,170
you can check that

1362
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:45,550
because you know what the

1363
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,600
the sign theta is times lab

1364
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:52,800
and i told you will have those

1365
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:54,380
this time is no

1366
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:59,240
and we get n equals one you know lambda is you know what these we

1367
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,620
can calculate

1368
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,190
the angle

1369
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,930
sin theta

1370
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:08,950
and that translates into an exit value of about plus and minus

1371
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:12,650
plus and minus one point two percent

1372
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:15,340
buried here statistically

1373
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:18,580
if you you will see it with four days

1374
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:21,820
the most but not that the if you want to try

1375
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:23,580
what you do is is you put your

1376
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:26,650
finger in front like this and that you think

1377
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:29,780
and when you look at your finger what will probably is it you should see

1378
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:30,760
what's on the

1379
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,130
and now i'm moving you finger in and out

1380
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:40,070
i have come where you want to get certain

1381
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,170
moving you finger in and out

1382
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,400
you know the amount of the homeless

1383
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:48,420
of the of the thing on the screen will vary

1384
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:52,860
and you probably you think quite a long way from actually

1385
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:56,730
and yes me about something close to a slide

1386
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,800
and all of a sudden you find your

1387
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:01,670
your vision fusing

1388
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:03,710
and not the way it was before

1389
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:08,480
it's like a weird feeling together with feeling hold onto it don't go

1390
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:09,550
and you have to

1391
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:11,040
and you have to just sort of

1392
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:15,040
you have to hold it for a while because it actually might take ten seconds

1393
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:19,440
for this impression of that the here is anybody getting it

1394
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:21,580
is anybody feel that

1395
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:27,660
if you feel that your c

1396
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:32,420
a three-dimensional shape very

1397
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:35,690
i guess for me if i look and i think that's too much

1398
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:40,880
allow gays to go very slowly if you think about the whiteboard but not too

1399
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:46,690
keep keep the dublin my stop halfway between your finger the whiteboard

1400
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:48,000
in this sort of

1401
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,790
usually long position

1402
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:50,880
and really getting this

1403
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:54,300
and what you see

1404
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,610
because you see the flowers

1405
01:25:57,630 --> 01:25:59,610
it's valentine's card

1406
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:02,210
it's called a heart buried

1407
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,790
saint valentine's day the patron saint of love

1408
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:14,940
you guys may be struggling with this but the computer it's easy

1409
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:19,710
the computer we do the cross-eyed admitted did across a bit for me it's just

1410
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:21,690
that the computer says he would write either

1411
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,540
you know you're supposed to do with your right i was left died the bit

1412
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:29,800
that you're supposed to have died and then we asked the computer to fuse the

1413
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:32,370
two images

1414
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:34,550
and that's what it sees

1415
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:36,830
that was what you saw it

1416
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,460
four of

1417
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:47,810
that's it sees this is a map showing that brightness that is the most distant

1418
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:51,660
i think all one

1419
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:53,140
well the whole

1420
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:58,480
i the computer can you know

1421
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,080
can sort of solvent such detailed paper this hidden

1422
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:05,210
so this would be nice to know it

1423
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:08,600
we're going to about stereo problem

1424
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:12,000
and why it's hard to be the

1425
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,060
the problem is that the computer has to take

1426
01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:19,460
in the left image

1427
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:22,580
for every pixel in the image of a partner in the writing it will match

1428
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:25,960
it so you know you have you know that those here match

1429
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:31,620
notice here but can you doesn't have the benefit of the sticky semantic something like

1430
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:34,560
all of you one time used to argue a lot about you know whether you

1431
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,640
would have sort of recognise the things in the image

1432
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:43,310
doing being able to do the matching and i guess now they

1433
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:47,520
received wisdom is that you don't and actually low level

1434
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:52,560
the top level analysis the level of image processing rather than semantics is enough in

1435
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,020
principle i mean to enable you

1436
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:58,380
to enable these to a computer program to the math

1437
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,470
so it's not necessary to assume that

1438
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:05,150
human vision recognizing reported very

1439
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,750
so where does it match

1440
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:10,160
the computer want that

1441
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:11,660
i could be anywhere

1442
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,760
and you know we're in trouble if we really have to consider all of those

1443
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,100
implicit subsumption relationships

1444
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:24,880
is there any specific question with respect to

1445
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:30,760
t boxes

1446
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:34,440
yes please

1447
01:28:34,500 --> 01:29:02,380
you mean that at ministry staff disjoint from faculty

1448
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:10,610
and research assistance are disjoint from faculty are disjoint from administrators stuff

1449
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:21,310
so it might make sense to explicitly say that

1450
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:24,570
people are disjoint from departments and so on

1451
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:28,210
the system doesn't take this for granted one has to

1452
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:34,090
somehow implicitly states that this is the case otherwise the system has not enough restrictions

1453
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:39,210
imposed this meaning that the point in the other thing that is

1454
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:41,090
the usual

1455
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,960
technique is to say that it will be

1456
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:48,970
there there's three kinds of employees right

1457
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:53,300
administrators staff faculty and research assistant and nothing else

1458
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,670
that's that's all

1459
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:58,130
so we have a so-called cover

1460
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:01,430
we specify that employee

1461
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:02,510
it is under

1462
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:09,320
the disjunction of this one this one and this one and you see

1463
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:15,170
if you specify this you are far away from you know standard modeling languages however

1464
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:16,960
as you

1465
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:23,140
ontology languages and the description logics behind them

1466
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:29,010
modeling facilities that are available in

1467
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:32,840
entity relationship modeling as well as

1468
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:36,710
large parts of the u mailing which

1469
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:42,640
i mean the advantage here is that you have a formal semantics no guessing what

1470
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:52,470
this spend might mean

1471
01:30:56,780 --> 01:31:12,010
if we have a look at the definition of chair

1472
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:16,100
i have a look at the axioms here

1473
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:26,400
i can take the i will show you one one text based

1474
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:33,590
just for the

1475
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,820
for the impression

1476
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:38,390
and then we see that

1477
01:31:38,430 --> 01:31:42,890
we have a chair

1478
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,680
find here

1479
01:31:49,390 --> 01:31:52,970
as class

1480
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,720
and there is

1481
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,770
the chair is a person

1482
01:31:56,780 --> 01:32:01,940
and there is a restriction on the property had off of fillers of head of

1483
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:02,730
must be

1484
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:08,310
if you see this is for machine processing but it's good that there is a

1485
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:12,780
language that machines can process according to the semantics of the

1486
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:16,430
plus of ontology languages and you use see

1487
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,270
this is far more

1488
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:25,680
then just representing triples in RDF triple store and use some triple query language that

1489
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:28,940
just gets you what's listed in all those

1490
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:32,260
triples cell

1491
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:32,820
p PM

1492
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:38,050
semantics that comes into play here because you see it is not explicitly mentioned

1493
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:41,920
the chair is the professor as you have seen on the previous display

1494
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:51,510
this is

1495
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,610
exactly represented here

1496
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:56,810
in the definitions for the

1497
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,060
head off so it

1498
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:03,460
as you see my my example is life example

1499
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:08,470
here you see the domain restriction and it is obvious that

1500
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:13,380
here we have a specific syntax but no matter what syntax to use

1501
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:19,100
the resulting in the effect is that a chair is professor which is something that

1502
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:22,300
is not explicitly specified in the

1503
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:28,630
xml call that you see that dealing with ontology reasoning systems is more than just

1504
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:34,310
define explicitly model i lost my pen

1505
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:33,890
but that is

1506
01:34:33,890 --> 01:34:38,470
this is an an issue of the editing environment to automatically generate the things that

1507
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:41,590
you want to have

1508
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:50,820
now we wouldn't change your reasoning as we said you would add axioms implicitly

1509
01:35:10,930 --> 01:35:12,720
right good point yes

1510
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:23,760
yeah good point is now

1511
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:26,570
i think we understand quite

1512
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:31,360
much about the ontology is about the particular about the tee box level i would

1513
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:34,780
like to turn to the instance level to the box level

1514
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,820
oh yes please

1515
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:59,570
most query tools to retrieve what's explicit if you have a reason for RDF which

1516
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:00,760
has an

1517
01:36:00,770 --> 01:36:04,220
semantics that is not at all easy to understand then you would get the same

1518
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:13,980
love your

1519
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:21,380
so most of the conversation at dinner actually revolved around people falling asleep during talks

1520
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:22,730
after dinner so

1521
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:26,770
so is making a very nervous but you know i noticed some of you have

1522
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:30,640
appearance of have coffee so i can just keep keep an eye on whether there

1523
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:33,070
is any correlation between

1524
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:34,120
this way

1525
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:38,180
anyway i was in a funny mood whenever the abstract to this and this is

1526
01:36:39,070 --> 01:36:42,710
got me in this position here i just thought well what i want to talk

1527
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:45,530
about at all as small workshop

1528
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:50,100
among friends right and i don't really want to talk about my own research because

1529
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:50,830
you know

1530
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:52,220
i know about it

1531
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:56,180
it bores me to talk about research but it's fun to talk about you know

1532
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:59,030
kind of the big picture of itself

1533
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:01,990
here's what i mean do i'm gonna

1534
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,530
i'm gonna run through sort of

1535
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:10,030
the canonical story we could give to motivate people for why they would want to

1536
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:14,600
be bayesian OK and then i'm going to try to critique that have been not

1537
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:17,450
going to say well do we really believe this

1538
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:20,650
and then i'm just going to jump around and talk about a few of the

1539
01:37:20,650 --> 01:37:25,030
questions that i think should really be on our minds and certainly are on my

1540
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:31,900
mind so you know a lot of machine learning involves classification regression clustering and things

1541
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:38,010
like that and we all know that basically we can take any canonical machine learning

1542
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:43,290
problem and write it down in terms of the two components we have some data

1543
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:48,210
we have some model with some parameters and then we have some gold that that's

1544
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:54,060
bayesians we can write out as an inference problem and most people don't really think

1545
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:59,400
about things exactly that way but really you know take canonical problem like linear classification

1546
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:05,280
you have some datasets these crosses and shows you have some models some linear boundary

1547
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:09,200
and rather than thinking of it as some sort of optimisation problem we can think

1548
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:13,920
about it is the problem of inferring some unknown quantity that these parameters from the

1549
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,450
data source to predict future labels

1550
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,420
this is part of like a canonical tutorial you would give

1551
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:21,290
and you know that the

1552
01:38:22,390 --> 01:38:24,140
i and i'm sure all of you

1553
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:28,540
also give for doing this is that we can apply the basic rules of probability

1554
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:31,910
going this sort of learning

1555
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:33,980
we all know what these rules are

1556
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:40,230
we apply it in the context of machine learning and we think of computing posteriors

1557
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:48,980
over unknown quantities given the data by multiplying some likelihood by some prior and renormalizing

1558
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:52,950
and we can do model comparison we can do prediction

1559
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:57,290
this is part of this and blasting through the canonical stories so that we can

1560
01:38:57,290 --> 01:39:03,320
critique so that's it that's a really you know in some ways i kind of

1561
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:06,650
feel like that's all we need to know about machine learning the rest is just

1562
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:10,020
sort of mechanics algorithmics and so on

1563
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:14,800
but that's not how most people in the field of machine learning think about this

1564
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:17,660
which surprises me still

1565
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:23,480
let's ask some of these questions well

1566
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:28,110
should all machine learning be bayesian and you know if we think the answer is

1567
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:32,390
yes then why isn't it that will come to that later like you know if

1568
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:37,190
we really think that this basic framework is really elegant y

1569
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:38,470
if i go to

1570
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:44,760
typical conference like ICML why are bayesian papers maybe like ten percent of papers that

1571
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:53,350
so again what i'll do is out of blast through some of the arguments that

1572
01:39:54,010 --> 01:39:59,010
these i have given tutorials these are clearly not things i've come up with these

1573
01:39:59,010 --> 01:40:04,130
things i picked up from other places i giving tutorials for why i you know

1574
01:40:04,130 --> 01:40:07,830
how i try to convince people that bayesianism is the right way to go

1575
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:11,760
OK and then we can go and critique those because we're in in in small

1576
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:16,860
company here and nobody on videolectures is really going to watch this race

1577
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,320
right so why should we be bayesian

1578
01:40:22,330 --> 01:40:26,890
so one of the arguments is that if we want a system to behave intelligently

1579
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:30,430
should represent beliefs about propositions in the world

1580
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:34,520
and we want to represent the strength of those beliefs numerically in the brain of

1581
01:40:35,230 --> 01:40:38,430
artificial agent like a robot for example

1582
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:43,710
and we want some set of rules are calculus for manipulating those transit beliefs

1583
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:47,520
one of the standard arguments you get from the

1584
01:40:47,530 --> 01:40:54,670
artificial intelligence point of view is the sort of arguments based on the cox axioms

1585
01:40:54,670 --> 01:41:01,160
that are described in james's book and there's a really nice paper by kevin van

1586
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:02,370
horn actually

1587
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:04,480
that is sort of more modern

1588
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:10,440
treatment of this and discusses some of the critiques of those arguments into this spells

1589
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:15,090
those critics so the arguments are basically that if we want to represent the strength

1590
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:17,710
of belief and propositions about the world

1591
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:23,490
assume that we want it's the strength of belief to be somewhere between zero and

1592
01:41:23,490 --> 01:41:25,110
one where zero is

1593
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:29,550
that x is definitely not true whereas one is that x is definitely true and

1594
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:31,650
we write down conditional release

1595
01:41:31,670 --> 01:41:34,770
what is your strength of belief in x given y

1596
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:38,160
that if we accept certain axioms

1597
01:41:38,210 --> 01:41:41,250
and you can read about the if you haven't already

1598
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:49,050
the consequences of these axioms is that belief functions this be of x

1599
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:51,370
b of x given y et cetera

1600
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:54,710
they must satisfy the rules of probability theory

1601
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:57,490
including bayes rule so this is one way

1602
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:59,630
we can justify

1603
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:03,460
that if we want artificial systems of beliefs about the world than

1604
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:05,540
we should use

1605
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:09,540
the language of probability like we do in normal discourse right like you know we

1606
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:13,920
say i think it's probable that you know the sun will rise tomorrow that statement

1607
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:17,180
of one's beliefs about something that's going to happen in the future

1608
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:19,920
certainly not repeatable experiment

1609
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:28,540
that's one classifier for bayesian thinking another classic argument is the dutch book theorem where

1610
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:33,530
now we're assuming that we have strength of beliefs and were also gambling people so

1611
01:42:33,530 --> 01:42:35,210
we're willing to bet

1612
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:41,170
and if our strength belief is point nine then we're willing to accept bets where

1613
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:45,470
if x is true we win anything greater than or equal to one dollar if

1614
01:42:45,470 --> 01:42:51,310
x is false we lose nine dollars or something like that and the dutch book

1615
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:53,880
argument says that

1616
01:42:56,030 --> 01:43:01,730
beliefs are strands of beliefs satisfy the rules of probability theory including bayes rule then

1617
01:43:01,730 --> 01:43:06,830
there exist a set of simultaneous bets called a dutch book which you would be

1618
01:43:06,830 --> 01:43:11,240
willing to accept but which for which you are guaranteed to lose money no matter

1619
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,600
what the outcome is

1620
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,160
of kernel adatron

1621
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:17,260
that retains the threshold allows the threshold

1622
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:21,210
and the corresponding constraints on the way it does it i mean the problem with

1623
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:25,580
the kernel adatron is that if you into individually update the

1624
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:30,520
alpha rise you know make this update than that

1625
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:32,210
that constraint will fail

1626
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:37,020
because you just change one value so what SMO does is just use two values

1627
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:38,180
of the

1628
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:41,210
you know so that constraint still satisfied

1629
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:48,200
so it's just a little bit more complicated but hopefully now one thing is very

1630
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:53,960
nice to observe from the kernel adatron algorithm is the act convergence you know i

1631
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,020
convergence three things can happen

1632
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:59,340
just show again the

1633
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:02,430
here's the update

1634
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:08,050
nowak convergence alpha rai doesn't change for any of these updates right because they just

1635
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:11,470
assume that this is fixed so what could have happened well

1636
01:44:11,490 --> 01:44:12,450
one thing

1637
01:44:12,460 --> 01:44:14,620
could be that this can be zero

1638
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:16,300
right which means that

1639
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:19,420
this update to offer i will be zero

1640
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:23,660
OK another thing could be that this could be taking alpha i

1641
01:44:23,670 --> 01:44:29,310
downwards but alpha rise already zero so that fry was zero

1642
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:30,840
this was negative

1643
01:44:30,870 --> 01:44:34,370
alpha right they will be negative but then it will be put back to zero

1644
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:36,830
because we push it back into this interval

1645
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:38,500
so that's another possibility

1646
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:42,630
and the third possibility is that this alpha rise already the top of the interval

1647
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:47,630
and this is positive and so it's take it outside the interval then we're updating

1648
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:48,640
back onto c

1649
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:53,250
so those three possibilities that there could be occurring at the

1650
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:58,920
so it's very easy to see that if

1651
01:44:58,950 --> 01:45:00,910
this is

1652
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:06,140
this possibility of right was zero and this less than or equal to zero corresponds

1653
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:10,680
to implies that if the margin is bigger than one

1654
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:13,850
in other words if the points are not actually

1655
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:19,390
inside the mountain region and the corresponding alpha rai zero

1656
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:22,950
OK because that is the only constraints

1657
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:24,140
it satisfies

1658
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:26,060
you know if this is because one

1659
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:28,350
and in that case alpha i must be zero

1660
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:30,500
so what this tells us is that the

1661
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:37,310
the points that lie outside the margin region have zero alpha so in fact many

1662
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:39,020
of the office nonzero

1663
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,850
and is that there is one of the key properties

1664
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,210
that makes this

1665
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:46,590
working work efficiently

1666
01:45:46,630 --> 01:45:51,050
i both the kernel adatron algorithm and the whole

1667
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:56,420
you know support vector thing because that someone more evaluating new example

1668
01:45:56,430 --> 01:46:00,510
some alpha i y is not a sum over all of the training data is

1669
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:03,790
only a sum over those that having non-zero offers

1670
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:08,790
and those are referred to as the support vectors in the sense that they support

1671
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:12,170
the hyperplane and that's why it's called the support she

1672
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:16,210
because these alpha rise effectively defining the weight vector

1673
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:19,630
just to quickly go back to that

1674
01:46:23,490 --> 01:46:24,550
so this

1675
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:27,660
some here although i've written it i was one to n

1676
01:46:27,670 --> 01:46:31,700
in fact in the support vector case many of these out rise will be zero

1677
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:33,660
and only those that are

1678
01:46:33,670 --> 01:46:36,270
in this sort of margin region will be non-zero

1679
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:41,420
so that some will be a much smaller sum on the whole the training set

1680
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:46,230
that that's

1681
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:54,160
so now i'm going to the sort of just

1682
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:56,990
they have to give you a feel of the general

1683
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:04,130
applicability of these approaches so in order to apply support vector machines you need to

1684
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:05,510
choose a kernel

1685
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:08,950
you could either use the standard inner product

1686
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,760
you could use the polynomial kernel

1687
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:12,170
calcium kernel

1688
01:47:12,170 --> 01:47:15,210
or specific kernel for different datatypes

1689
01:47:15,230 --> 01:47:19,670
polynomial kernel was the one i described the gas one i gave on the slides

1690
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:23,840
you need to set parameter c and you can do that by using cross validation

1691
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:28,340
but frequently the data is normalized than the standard value when i mean normalized mean

1692
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:32,590
feature space normalized you can you can again do that quite easily

1693
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,180
usually a value of one is fine

1694
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:41,850
so more generally kernel methods are

1695
01:47:41,870 --> 01:47:46,910
extended beyond support vector machines they're built on this idea of using kernel defined feature

1696
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:50,520
spaces for a variety of learning tasks

1697
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:52,120
and the issues are

1698
01:47:52,130 --> 01:47:53,800
you know choosy kernel

1699
01:47:53,830 --> 01:47:55,520
for the different data

1700
01:47:55,540 --> 01:47:59,160
what other learning tasks and out corresponding algorithms you know what is

1701
01:47:59,170 --> 01:48:01,880
we love to support vectors other other ones

1702
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:04,040
and subspace techniques such as

1703
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:06,810
principal component analysis for finding the kernels

1704
01:48:06,830 --> 01:48:10,310
in the feature space so those are the three sort of if you like i

1705
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:12,640
think additional things you need to think about

1706
01:48:12,670 --> 01:48:17,630
and this is if you like sort of plug-and-play

1707
01:48:17,630 --> 01:48:22,790
display of what's going on so you start with your data over here

1708
01:48:24,490 --> 01:48:25,950
choose the kernel

1709
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:27,490
this one was suggested in fact

1710
01:48:28,110 --> 01:48:28,710
by office

1711
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:30,200
should be less than

1712
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:31,700
this number

1713
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:34,430
because he subject some some rather be c

1714
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:39,360
surprisingly this is not the case

1715
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:43,290
little proved in nineteen fourteen

1716
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,710
that for infinitely many x

1717
01:48:46,700 --> 01:48:48,480
biophys is greater than in

1718
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:52,680
but it was purely

1719
01:48:57,700 --> 01:48:58,980
but a little gave

1720
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:00,480
no kidding

1721
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,480
a particular example of such an act

1722
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:04,960
not even about where to find it

1723
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:08,320
and this was done much later by news

1724
01:49:09,370 --> 01:49:12,780
who proved that instead there is such an expert find this inequality

1725
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:14,760
is in such a balance

1726
01:49:17,710 --> 01:49:19,640
you're lot today about that time

1727
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:22,220
this number produced a great competition

1728
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:23,840
and for example

1729
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:29,970
this is the largest number that have served any definite purpose in mathematics

1730
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:33,750
and this number was called

1731
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:34,910
q numbers

1732
01:49:35,330 --> 01:49:35,960
schools number

1733
01:49:37,090 --> 01:49:38,010
later it was

1734
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,990
a small amount potentially also called cues numbers and sometimes

1735
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:46,340
now the whole school's numbers at least at about four

1736
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:48,710
such an next

1737
01:49:51,590 --> 01:49:53,890
how was involved in this activity

1738
01:49:56,410 --> 01:49:58,420
nineteen thirty one he became a student

1739
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:00,120
in cambridge

1740
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:03,740
and one of the professors was in government

1741
01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:05,210
who in nineteen

1742
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:07,000
two published

1743
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:09,730
classical book on number

1744
01:50:11,490 --> 01:50:12,270
and then is a book

1745
01:50:13,070 --> 01:50:15,570
he gave a simplified proof of a little theorem

1746
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:18,550
and most important

1747
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:21,400
skills the time was also in cambridge

1748
01:50:22,730 --> 01:50:24,300
moreover it is known that

1749
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:25,590
student can skills

1750
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:28,540
role in on the same boat very often

1751
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:31,490
and disposable supposedly syringes this role and

1752
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:36,990
student about his big number

1753
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:44,380
and that is the intention of doing was just in substance more than

1754
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:47,670
how to do it

1755
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:49,890
of course one can look

1756
01:50:50,990 --> 01:50:52,530
the formula given by eighteen months

1757
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:58,640
and it to explain what is this function briefly

1758
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:01,480
it is defined as such a serious

1759
01:51:02,230 --> 01:51:02,950
it converges in

1760
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:04,170
so plane

1761
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:07,580
and defines analytical fast and can be extended to the whole

1762
01:51:12,210 --> 01:51:13,700
during the proved

1763
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:14,710
that all

1764
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:17,190
none really zero so that the function

1765
01:51:17,910 --> 01:51:20,240
lie inside so-called critical strip

1766
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:25,500
this is the if the real part is below zero and one

1767
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:27,830
know the critical step is

1768
01:51:28,230 --> 01:51:30,520
outside the region of convergence of the series

1769
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:32,190
which makes it difficult

1770
01:51:35,430 --> 01:51:36,380
the famous americans

1771
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,990
hypothesis states

1772
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,240
that in fact all the real heroes

1773
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:45,030
in the middle of the critical strip on called

1774
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:46,020
critical line

1775
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:51,270
and this is one of the millennium problems

1776
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:55,600
over seven million problems

1777
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:56,840
it is

1778
01:51:57,350 --> 01:51:58,090
very important

1779
01:52:01,390 --> 01:52:04,340
for example it implies that these different because

1780
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:07,300
like this it's like of x plus

1781
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:10,340
for some small additional factors like fixed

1782
01:52:12,230 --> 01:52:12,760
and text

1783
01:52:14,150 --> 01:52:15,070
the remarkable thing is

1784
01:52:15,790 --> 01:52:17,030
is important for computer

1785
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:18,780
thanks also

1786
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:22,630
was already mentioned the result of mean

1787
01:52:23,930 --> 01:52:27,150
in fact if the generalized remarkable this is not true

1788
01:52:28,150 --> 01:52:28,690
then there would no

1789
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:31,830
there is no good reason for certain probability

1790
01:52:32,390 --> 01:52:34,300
in polynomial time much much earlier

1791
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:41,710
so what is known as the time when student with interested

1792
01:52:42,170 --> 01:52:43,560
in the room and hypothesis

1793
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,720
in nineteen all sitting ground

1794
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:50,690
the first fifteen zeros lie on the critical line

1795
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:54,310
later but proved the same for seventy eight

1796
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:57,490
but because some four hundred thirty eight

1797
01:52:58,170 --> 01:52:59,460
and the final numbers
