1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
those topics from boy and two which is the

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,550
focused lot in there plans to bananas italian also by with which is a bit

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,700
more related to analysis so those are all good books

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,300
now to get more into this topic

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,020
so for let's start the simple things first when you have an end to rise

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,100
so you have the same the same term ever on the table now

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,870
the square the square of the internet on this is the square of the norm

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,430
so now this is a differentiable problem if l is differentiable with respect to the

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,110
second viable

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,550
you can compute the gradient surfaces with the gradient descent for the loss close to

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,550
gradient for the for the regularizer and of course to be optimal just said the

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,000
gradient equal to zero

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,150
in the case of the square loss so we can parameterized it is a loss

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:57,090
well why just vector always all values of y are subject of an in depth

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,890
x is the design matrix which is times be where all

16
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,010
of the observations are stacked rule by

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,250
so this loss function this

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,190
some of the losses over all the points where this is the losses

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,220
the square square is simply can be done with a simple formula

20
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,220
so if you take the derivative of that while the gradient you get this value

21
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,950
in your to get the usual normal equations

22
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,210
this is what life is easy

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:29,150
and we have as well as in square regularizer so if you remember one thing

24
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,490
about the tutorial

25
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,220
this is this one because the one norm is known

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,490
it is not differentiable so if you try to compute the gradient is bound to

27
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,200
fail at one point k

28
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,890
so the good tools to do that

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,020
you have two sets of tools

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,250
with the one of them is to consider the directional derivatives

31
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,320
which i looked at this tutorial

32
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,820
you may use subgradient so you can go back and forth between those two

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,120
it's simpler to to present national eighties which have been doing in this line so

34
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,810
never try to compute the gradient does anyone know

35
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,380
you can always go got some stuff when w is far from zero but that's

36
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,270
you always kind of problematic

37
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,890
so what you need to do

38
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,770
is to consider in fact the natives along all possible directions OK so you look

39
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,830
at direction that i know of being and you take stuff from w and go

40
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:25,440
along this direction and see the rate of change along the direction which is exactly

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,320
it's actually is that these things and this is exactly what people call the directional

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,560
derivative in the direction of of

43
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,050
the good thing when j is convex continues

44
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,330
is that it always there always exists and why do we need to consider that

45
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,570
essentially in a nonsmooth optimization you need to be able to consider all possible directions

46
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,920
and not only

47
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,360
p different once the gradient is essentially

48
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,120
looking at the different directions with nonsmooth optimization you need to look at all possible

49
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,340
ones and in one d it means looking at two OK left and right

50
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,480
of course when j is differentiable

51
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,320
then you have

52
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,870
strong link between directional derivatives in regions namely that the directional derivative is a linear

53
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,090
function of fuel

54
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,330
so now i how decide whether you people are not physicists imposes just the rate

55
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,070
of change in direction that if two or more of these height of ten should

56
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,230
be going

57
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:35,340
i unconstrained minimisation your optimal if only all directions you meaning that you locally good

58
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,080
meaning that the

59
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,470
the directional derivative is positive whatever actions

60
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:47,570
OK first if the function is smooth it does reduce to the to the silk

61
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:53,190
road condition because having only now function being positive be zero and so this is

62
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,360
just a safety check if we get back to gradient forecast from intimidation one go

63
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,470
it is just for reference

64
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,830
so now i look like for for the one on so this is one of

65
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,930
the few slides with we did it improves but i think this is what is

66
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,370
but importantly to get that when you get most of it

67
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,400
this not only true but

68
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,370
the truth OK so this is the last place along that time so i can

69
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,440
arise are so i call and capital and of the value the loss

70
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,840
which is the sum of all the points and you need to go so this

71
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,520
one i would assume differentiable

72
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,730
OK so when you need to compute the derivative the first is simply the gradient

73
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,800
steps that are not the norm to compute the rate of change the change along

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,580
direction that you immediately immediately see that you have to

75
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,880
make a distinction between j index in this is for which the village is zero

76
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,290
and this is for which it is nonzero

77
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,100
so when it is zero essentially far away from zero your function is linear OK

78
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,540
behaves like the likelihood function

79
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,600
but i had zero when wj zero

80
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,680
then if you always get

81
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,720
is the positive terminal so when you divide by zero and then the limit you

82
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,490
will get

83
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,830
nine after of the data

84
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,710
just motivated and which is happening here

85
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,890
so now if you mix is and one on which is a differentiable part together

86
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:30,280
survivors some sort of all possible j j goes from one to the

87
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,550
he differentiable part on the left for which jwj is nonzero

88
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,330
and you have the non differential apart and when the is

89
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,850
OK so now how do we get approximate conditions

90
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,270
that would be optimal if this is positive for all possible sources you have

91
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,100
since this is separable in that i j

92
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,070
for all j

93
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,660
after all you need all those terms to be to be positive

94
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,250
so for this way means that it is zero because this is enough function which

95
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,070
is positive on if it is always equal to zero

96
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,170
and you get this one

97
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:15,340
this has to be positive and this essentially require that this term is less than

98
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,100
in absolute value y because if it is

99
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:25,530
let's armed then this is a this is always positive because it is always bigger

100
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,240
one minus the value

101
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,140
if the value is bigger than yours and mine is that you get the positive

102
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,180
OK this is a so if you think about it if you have two months

103
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,820
ago and we see that you need

104
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,850
the absolute value of the gradient to be less than under

105
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,120
and this is what you get them

106
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,480
you get your optimum

107
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:51,150
if you are the gradient of of the last-place lambda times cited wj zero

108
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,900
but it's incremental

109
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,440
and it can provide results

110
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,260
with the learning phase beginning at the beginning of the stream and based on the

111
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,490
host tree

112
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,650
for most methods

113
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,470
you have to adapt the method if it's not incremental

114
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,770
so i'm going to

115
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:20,810
a present some work on decision trees to make incremental

116
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,840
if you have

117
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,850
sliding window

118
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,470
is a good case

119
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
which are

120
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,690
additive met if you have additive methods

121
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,650
it's OK

122
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,520
you can

123
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,650
is only

124
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,730
apply the algorithm to a sliding window i'm going to show how

125
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,020
with the example of PCA

126
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,370
and if you want to apply to any portion of the stream

127
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,310
it's going to more that is going to be more difficult

128
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,350
you will have to be temporal

129
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,870
and i we give an example with clustering

130
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,190
four decision trees

131
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,100
there have been some work

132
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,850
in two thousand

133
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,980
with the construction of very fast decision trees yes he he

134
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,600
from some work from domingos and

135
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,400
so these are standard decision trees

136
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,660
you have

137
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:24,400
variables to predict which are either discrete or continuous

138
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,150
and values to predict

139
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,560
despite that attribute

140
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,630
and elements of the stream are

141
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:42,020
with element containing i both variable predictors and the to

142
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,700
so we assume here

143
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,550
we have

144
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,140
g of x

145
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,980
which is the measure

146
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,650
you use it

147
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,940
to choose the splits

148
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,730
so far

149
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,440
a given set of elements

150
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,690
you which is the variable

151
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,780
and the cat forgetting

152
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,610
on this variable which

153
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,060
g of

154
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,020
so the idea is very simple

155
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,400
and the algorithm

156
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,770
it's quite basic but i think it's interesting

157
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,980
it's called the hoeffding trees

158
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,990
the idea is that it's not necessary to wait for example

159
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,970
to choose a split

160
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,520
so the output is this

161
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,980
so there are several

162
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,320
assumptions in this work

163
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,850
and one assumption

164
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,730
is that the distribution of data expression a very important

165
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,520
so the output is this is about

166
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,130
the measure for

167
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,020
converges to an average measure

168
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,940
and then if you

169
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,350
the hoeffding inequality

170
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,090
you can say that

171
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,010
by observing

172
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,550
and dating

173
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,260
measure of

174
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,900
you can say that variable or j is better than j prime

175
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,020
if the different

176
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,770
it is greater than the

177
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,760
born to the probability

178
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,700
having the

179
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,050
variable choosing the wrong

180
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,110
the algorithm is the following

181
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,510
is that

182
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,810
is maintained

183
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,650
or variables

184
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,850
first the vagaries and waits for a minimum number of examples

185
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,720
and it takes

186
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,970
the two variables with the highest value of j

187
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,190
and when the difference of JAPE obvious to high use

188
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,560
values variables

189
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,630
it is greater than epsilon

190
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,510
it decides

191
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,840
the split

192
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,800
on their board

193
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,530
alright so i'm going to introduced this will one move from delta g

194
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,430
into thinking about the relationship between delta g and k

195
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,310
equilibrium constants

196
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,970
so basically the point to remember about equilibrium

197
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,730
that it is a dynamic process so not reaction has

198
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,760
when it reaches equilibrium

199
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,670
reactions are still going

200
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,220
the rate of the reaction

201
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,690
and the rate of the

202
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,270
reaction are equal

203
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,150
so there is no net change in the composition of the material

204
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,070
reactions are still growing

205
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:51,460
there's no no no no change

206
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,530
so let's take a look

207
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,940
an example

208
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:58,670
of what that means

209
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,650
so if we take the reaction

210
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,410
h two

211
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,150
going to

212
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,710
reaction with delta g

213
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,420
minus thirty two

214
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,270
o point nine

215
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,070
withdrawals from all

216
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,090
we consider what happened

217
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,370
when the reaction starts

218
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,600
we we'll concentration

219
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,130
of the reactants and products

220
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,790
over time

221
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,960
at the beginning of the reaction

222
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,600
we're only going to have to react

223
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,640
so you would have hydrogen which would start

224
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,790
it would react to the concentration will change and decrease

225
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:56,540
and all

226
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,670
the same will happen

227
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,280
nitrogen reactive

228
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,760
o started a higher level and the concentration of

229
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,760
and the rule of law

230
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,930
and there will be no problem in the beginning

231
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,110
but the prior concentration will come out

232
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,700
and allow

233
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,970
so i want to make a point from lecture notes i spent i can't tell

234
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,110
you how long trying to make the core and powerpoints and once we got it

235
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,650
wrong one powerpoint

236
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,810
sometimes like it's not really going on in our powerpoint

237
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,390
what is the issue

238
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,130
and another in general discourse

239
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,890
in terms of the ability to walk things they are

240
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,320
the standard by parts of exams and green light for the final thing to draw

241
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,580
as well as i draw so this is an extremely or

242
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,170
in terms of drawing and you know you know when i went to college to

243
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,150
art is not on the way

244
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,790
so i apologize for some

245
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,190
nineteen occur

246
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,020
during this course

247
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,850
right but the point here

248
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,220
is that with the have first running at higher concentrations

249
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,060
are being can

250
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,400
they make product product is coming up

251
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,530
why how and what that means the equilibrium has been reached

252
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,180
the reaction is still going on it's going more reactions

253
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,020
there is going forward and backward

254
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,680
there is no net change the concentrations are level all

255
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,890
right before reaction

256
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:53,730
this is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction

257
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,570
so we can think about this in a different way

258
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,560
what's going on here

259
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:05,920
in terms of free energy

260
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,460
so if we think about wanting free energy

261
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,480
first forces

262
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:16,770
the rest of the reaction

263
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,270
free energy

264
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,030
delta g

265
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,980
sources progress

266
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,860
the reaction

267
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,470
in the beginning

268
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:35,910
you would have sure reactive

269
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,790
this point

270
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,440
delta g

271
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,740
it's going to be less than zero it be negative

272
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,280
so your reaction

273
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,590
the four

274
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,460
here you would

275
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,820
o come down

276
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,480
we have delta g

277
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,410
less than zero

278
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,640
the comes out

279
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,470
as the

280
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,070
both sides

281
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,220
we used this work comes out of the one on the right through two

282
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,800
run this one backward which is the same remove heat from cold behind

283
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,850
of right hand

284
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,260
to run cleft hand

285
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,100
why not

286
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,300
we need work to come in we might as well get it from here

287
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:05,390
the total work that we can get out

288
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,640
must be zero out of the hold some of them right after overtaking the output

289
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,820
work that we get from arriving using it all the driver

290
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,200
so that means

291
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,760
the line is double prime must equal w

292
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,070
w is greater than zero that is

293
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,620
in this one we have the environment doing work on the system

294
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,370
now we have assumed that

295
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,640
epsilon prime

296
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,660
is greater than epsilon

297
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,870
so we can just write out

298
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,930
but those are minus

299
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,370
w prime over q one prime is greater than mine w

300
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,200
over q one

301
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,660
but we know the miners w prime is the same thing is w

302
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,970
so w over q one prime

303
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,890
is greater than minus w

304
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,070
over q one

305
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,680
which is the same thing just

306
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,600
a little bit

307
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,300
maybe pedantic as

308
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,350
w over

309
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,100
minus q one

310
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,160
the only reason i'm writing that to

311
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,140
illustrate that this is the q one must be less than

312
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,640
q one prime

313
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,680
he one

314
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,950
is less than zero

315
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,680
this one's running back pumping here

316
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,240
one prime is greater than zero which running as an as an engine it's taking

317
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,910
heat from the core the hot reservoir

318
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,910
that's interesting

319
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,200
that says that minus

320
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,720
q one prime plus q one

321
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,510
is greater than zero

322
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,370
it's a pretty interesting result

323
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,490
there is no work being done on

324
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,350
out of the whole thing right

325
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,530
this is providing work being used in europe

326
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,390
if you take

327
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,740
the whole outside of the surroundings and

328
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,870
this whole thing is the system

329
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,820
no network

330
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,660
these things cancel each other

331
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,430
and yet

332
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,160
he's going up

333
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,070
how that happens

334
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:45,240
it happened because we clearly must have a faulty assumption underlying what we've just done

335
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,070
right this can't possibly be true

336
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,200
this is impossible

337
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,580
what this says is the efficiency of any reversible engine has to be one minus

338
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,070
the through

339
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,800
over t one

340
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:31,700
it's not a result that specific to the ones cycle that we put up

341
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,680
and you know

342
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,080
you could have a reversible engine with lots and lots of steps

343
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,800
but you can always break them down into some sequence

344
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,410
of the vatican isothermal step so you're cycle

345
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,070
you could have a whole complicated sequence on TV

346
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,800
diagram of steps

347
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,870
going back as long as it's reversible

348
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,660
you know what the efficiency has to be

349
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,740
and in principle you could break it down into a bunch of steps that is

350
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,930
isothermal in eighty about it they might have to be formulated in very small steps

351
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,660
in order to do that you could

352
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,070
what this has to

353
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:31,840
so this result

354
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,970
that we found

355
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,840
now of course

356
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,430
that's are

357
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,450
in a row

358
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,100
it is zero

359
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,470
its general right

360
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,100
entropy as

361
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,850
is a state function

362
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,100
now remember we went through before we just a function but calculate you need to

363
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,570
find irreversible path along which

364
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,840
you can

365
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,780
figure this out

366
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,220
but the fact is that the state function

367
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,660
in general way

368
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,290
good morning everybody can you do me a favor played

369
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:32,710
so i noticed that it's sometimes hard to understand the biggest in the last row

370
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,070
in the rows in the back

371
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,910
i'll try speaking loudly but i'm not quite sure whether it be loud enough

372
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,360
so if you could please do the following

373
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,590
if you stop understanding it was maybe at some point it will

374
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:52,730
rick is the volume of my speaking or whatever start waving your hands wildly

375
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,820
i mean that we can't fall asleep i mean

376
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,290
i mean i prefer if you wait to hand but for the first lecture is

377
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:06,660
going to be very very very elementary

378
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:12,350
in other words if you've ever the machine learning this will probably

379
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,950
too boring for you OK so that's not much for trying to motivate the audience

380
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,110
i'd say

381
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:32,330
so but if you have not done machine learning before only very little this might

382
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,560
actually be useful i mean the most challenging thing will be in the first place

383
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,400
in the first lectures is bayes rule and we'll look at independent random variables but

384
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,560
that's about it otherwise that the laser pointer some stick or something

385
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,160
but i could use

386
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,720
the really great

387
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,050
are you

388
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,920
it looks like

389
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,260
it's OK

390
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,430
it's much better

391
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,500
i mean that one looks like straight out of that was but we have the

392
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,160
OK so

393
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:21,040
let's get started the lectures all covering lectures just one point and fix the first

394
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,280
one is going to be really simple namely just really what machine learning at least

395
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,040
some parts of machine learning are

396
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,620
i mean there's no way i can really recover it all

397
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,010
at least i hope i'll be able to give you a flavour of it

398
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,520
so i will look at the article

399
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,660
classification regression novelty detection

400
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,560
probability theory bayes rule

401
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,730
that kind of stuff

402
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:47,660
election number five has been support vector machines so this a classical treatment would have

403
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,920
seen any

404
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:54,320
what the book and again you know about support vectors you might choose to give

405
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,700
that lecture

406
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,110
lecture number six is probably going to be slightly more interesting this this one will

407
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,470
talk about to this nation

408
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,760
this will actually contain some news but

409
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:12,440
this is like state-of-the-art nineteen forty that they are probably the two thousand

410
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,210
that's pretty much they you are what you will seeing here

411
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,060
so depending on your background you might not fall asleep so you emails whatever

412
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,640
you have a linear

413
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,020
good let's get going

414
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:30,030
what do we do in machine learning well

415
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,400
one thing that

416
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:35,330
or if you think about it what kind of WBC

417
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,980
text images pictures graphs and of course the collection of all the thing is by

418
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,200
no means complete but i hope you'll be able to give you

419
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,250
a useful

420
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,920
of course something that you might encounter

421
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,280
the point is that

422
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:55,050
quite often for instance when you download something like the UCI datasets

423
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,880
it's just getting a collection of it

424
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,000
and so you think that all of machine learning and they were convicted wrong

425
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,870
and this is really just to remind you that

426
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,590
while maybe at the end of the day you might be encountering also

427
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,230
and as a matter of fact when i will be talking about it we all

428
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,680
sorts of things in a hilbert space which is just a really bad civic spaces

429
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,140
usually you actually need to to do something to get your problem into that shape

430
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,730
the other thing to think about is well walking actually do with machine learning

431
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,330
and i be

432
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,310
giving you a couple of examples of what might what you might want to do

433
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,590
it again this list is by no means complete it's just to give you a

434
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,590
a flavor

435
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,870
is quite often when you think machine learning think OK well filling up from oranges

436
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,220
for binary classification on victoria park

437
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,990
and this is really just the tiny tiny fragments of what you really can do

438
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,640
so i will talk about the content of a page classification regression

439
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,280
time series nolte fictional that kind of stuff

440
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,170
i'll also briefly talk about what

441
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,420
you will to learn another thing

442
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,440
artificial intelligence always

443
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,700
in inference some people

444
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,300
i might have a very strong

445
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,840
a different view points there but

446
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:25,760
take it seriously disagree and then the end will actually do something practically useful namely

447
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,210
we look at bayes rule we look probabilities of being

448
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,110
dependence independence conditional probabilities

449
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,470
well we get to bayes rule

450
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,820
you'll get something useful out of this picture in terms of

451
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,660
take this out would go off and do something with it if you want to

452
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,900
let's start with that

453
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,900
later i will talk about that analysis

454
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,520
you can do but

455
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,210
so i want to get

456
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,420
you might have

457
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,110
they can be applicable doesn't mean that that if think that you might think

458
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,940
like the height weight blood pressure the age

459
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,520
if that's the case i mean

460
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,590
prince from medical applications out there might be missing

461
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,150
you might

462
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,250
i want to map categorical variables into victory

463
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:23,760
it's a very simple one medical record will female female OK

464
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,500
you will probably encounter this one here

465
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,090
that's not too bad but it's a i have bring

466
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,290
and having the property

467
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,050
the any given at any given y and z by summing over all values of

468
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,160
x i get one

469
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:41,550
OK that's that's what that's what that would be the discrete variables

470
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:45,050
if that big table of numbers has the property

471
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,630
when i conditional on z to apply slice of the table corresponding to a particular

472
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,480
value of z

473
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:57,060
and the value of x is the same for all the values of y

474
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:01,830
it doesn't depend upon the value of y then that conditional independence property holds

475
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:06,180
and there has to be true for every possible slice every possible value z

476
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,220
very simple

477
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,410
definition that's it that's all there is to it

478
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,220
and we'll see examples as we

479
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,680
until david introduced this notation x is independent of y given z

480
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,450
now we can write that in an equivalent form which is perhaps slightly more intuitive

481
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,360
supposing i look at the

482
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,450
joint distribution of x and y given z

483
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,450
using the product rule of probability

484
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,110
i can move one across the other side i get here that's given y times

485
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,240
p y

486
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,100
and they're both conditioned on z

487
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,080
so this is equivalent to this

488
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,380
and now i can i can make use of this property if i take this

489
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,780
apply to that there

490
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,590
the y disappears here that's given z times p

491
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,340
y given z

492
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,380
in other words

493
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,190
it factorizes conditioned on z p of x and y

494
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,670
factorized the p of x times PY

495
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:10,270
so the independent this statistically independent because the joint distribution is the product of the

496
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:16,450
marginals that's another equivalent definition

497
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,620
now while we

498
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:22,260
why are we going to all this trouble to discuss factorizations and discuss conditional independence

499
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,450
and the reason is that we want to build

500
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:31,290
models over many many variables and we can't work with the general joint distribution

501
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,560
over all of those variables for instance if you've got any binary variables two the

502
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,780
power was there are exponentially many configurations of those variables we don't want to have

503
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,670
to represent all store

504
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,660
well measure

505
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,260
although it's possible

506
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:52,050
so i went with joint distributions of many variables we need to work with simplified

507
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:56,490
models and the simplification can be expressed in terms of factorizations or in terms of

508
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,850
conditional independence or just

509
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:06,340
graphically which is gives us both of those properties

510
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,330
so the conditional independence property sometimes also called markov properties and

511
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,730
the question is can we determine the conditional independence properties directly from the graph

512
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,960
so if i draw the graph can you tell me what the conditional independence properties

513
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,500
will be for the for the

514
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,370
for the joint distribution

515
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:27,040
i should say for the family of joint distributions important idea

516
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,580
is that the graph doesn't described the distribution

517
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,270
despite the whole family of distributions

518
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:38,430
because i didn't tell you whether those variables were discrete or continuous with a guassian

519
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:42,830
whether they were gamma distributed or whatever so graph actually describe the properties of the

520
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,600
whole family of distributions

521
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,530
we'll talk about that later

522
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,060
so the answer is yes you can call

523
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,880
in the case of undirected graphs it's very easy in the case of directed graphs

524
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,290
there is one subtlety on very important

525
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,600
twist in the tale

526
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,700
so i guess we'll start with undirected graphs because that's the easy case

527
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,950
so prove any theorems here but i think this is sort of bordering on the

528
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:14,890
very easy to understand where this comes from so here is an undirected graph

529
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,250
now remember

530
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,420
an undirected graph specifies

531
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,430
the joint distribution is a product of functions over the cliques

532
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,720
it would be useful i guess to sort of identify the

533
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,980
cliques in this graph

534
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,610
so remember clearly

535
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,630
a set of nodes which are fully connected every node is connected to every other

536
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,880
node so we have

537
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:45,500
those three nodes are fully connected clearly transmitted to every other one

538
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,370
but there is no other node which i can include in the set which is

539
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:53,170
which is fully connected so i can't include this note

540
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,930
because there's no link from here to here

541
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,880
so those four nodes do not form a clique case that's one clique

542
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,390
and then here's another clique

543
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,940
here's another clique there's another clique and so on

544
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,800
so the joint distribution

545
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,390
he is just the product of functions over those

546
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,180
over those cliques

547
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,840
times normalisation factor

548
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,860
that's amazing i ask the question

549
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,840
let's consider these nodes here will call those two nodes x these two notable call

550
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,000
why those two letters will call z and we can ask the questions

551
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,940
is it the case that

552
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,820
like these

553
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,770
so we can check the frequency of these graph patterns

554
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:42,360
and the output  those frequent patterns and the discard those infrequent graph patterns and

555
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,970
sometimes we can put these frequent patterns of back into the pipeline and then run

556
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,240
it again and you can see that

557
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:54,310
with several iteration we will exhaust the graph pattern search space

558
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,320
all of these algorithms are different

559
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:03,150
in one step how to generate these K plus one edge graph pattern candidates from the

560
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,800
already discovered

561
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,390
k edge graph patern

562
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:15,070
before i introduce exact characteristics of their properties then just show you quickly about a

563
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:18,060
cost analysis to generate this is one of patterns

564
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,580
basically there are three components

565
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:26,050
which are related was expense to generate these graph patterns

566
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,220
the first part is graph pattern candidates

567
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:35,040
the second part is graph isomorphism checking so basically whenever you find a new candidates you

568
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,120
have to check

569
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:42,060
graph sub-isomorphism to change this pattern candidate and all of the graph in the database

570
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,010
the third component is the database size

571
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:49,410
you can see that for this part we cannot reduce database size but we

572
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,820
can reduce two things like this one and this one

573
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,320
that means in the in the first part

574
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:59,270
we would like to develop some mechanism so that we can generate a

575
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,690
those graph

576
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,740
pattern candidate s that are likely frequent

577
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,440
and and we would like to generate these graph patterns that are different from

578
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,020
the previously discovered patterns

579
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,930
and the second is

580
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,030
the graph isomorphism checking

581
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,610
that means because when we do that isomorphism checking you know that is that this

582
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:23,850
graph patterns are highly correlated can we use graph sub-graph isomorphism checking for

583
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:30,050
the previous graph patterns for the subgraph isomorphism checking for the newly discovered patterns

584
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:36,280
so OK so now let me summarise the design principles of all these graphs

585
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,710
pattern mining algorithms basically i summarise them into five factors

586
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,430
search order

587
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,320
generation of candidate patterns

588
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:50,780
discovery order of patterns

589
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,670
elimination of duplicate subgraphs

590
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,590
and support calculation

591
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,810
so this is very obvious for example search order some some algorithms adopt

592
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,450
breath first some algorithms adopt depth research

593
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,550
for the support calculations

594
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:10,410
actually there are two methods one is we can remember all of the graph sub

595
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:15,980
isomorphisms testing in the main memory for some algorithms, they cannot do this method

596
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,090
they just calculate the sub-graph

597
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:24,090
isomorphism from scratch each time when we check the frequency of our graph pattern candidates

598
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:29,320
in the next several slides i will focus on this three main properties on main

599
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:35,240
design principles of the existing graph pattern mining algorithms and you will see that season

600
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,860
difference of these atoms

601
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:43,040
so this is the first the main property of these algorithms is about to the

602
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,430
generation of candidate graph patterns

603
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,970
we can divide this algorithm into two groups one is apriori based approaches

604
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,710
the second is the pattern grows approach

605
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,660
in the apriori based approach you can see that

606
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,590
suppose we are they discovered k edge

607
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,960
graph patterns

608
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,800
and then we have to generate the k plus one

609
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,470
graph pattern candidates

610
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,540
so in apriori based approach what they are doing is

611
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,340
they tried to join two k edge graph patterns together to generate k plus one

612
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:22,960
graph pattern candidates. by doing so actually it can avoid the generation of infrequent a

613
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,920
lot of infrequent graph patterns because in each step you have to make sure

614
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,660
the pattern you generated the candidate you generate generate must contain two frequent

615
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,270
well in the pattern growth approach

616
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,840
does not do the similar thing

617
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,560
instead it directly generates

618
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:49,730
frequent graph pattern candidate from the previous discovered parted for example suppose we have k edge

619
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,020
graph pattern, we can

620
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,140
directly add one edge to this k-edge

621
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,240
graph pattern to generate k plus one edge

622
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,110
graph pattern candidates

623
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,650
about the lowest you could you could safely and you and you keep your live

624
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:09,810
vector is basically flight would fly the entire entry with you vector going away from

625
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:14,530
Europe and that maximizes you're range but you actually targeting entry

626
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,570
so that you have more energy than you need because it's a lot easier to

627
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:23,100
bleed off energy than somehow to get it back especially when you don't have the

628
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,310
engine so what you what you normally do it is

629
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:32,780
you will basically do the will be rolling so that your angle of attack with

630
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:39,460
respect to your velocity vectors is always 40 degrees but essentially you're rolling around the

631
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:45,700
velocity vector so you can now point you will over the side and therefore for

632
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:53,500
instance of if you didn't I have enough propellant when you were burning and so

633
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,810
now you're you actually have too much energy and what you can do you off

634
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,730
for instance if you have a lot of cross that you have to make up

635
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,890
you could spend your entire entry over on your side like this and in fact

636
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:11,660
there was even a case which we will simulate it if you're if you're entry

637
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:16,430
burns if you open under burning you know you have too much energy you have

638
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:20,310
to really get rid of a lot of energy you can actually role or 180

639
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:26,360
degrees and energy that would be pretty supported in given up

640
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:32,240
it simulated I don't know people what would be expected period coming in but but

641
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:38,110
but the point is we we try to ignore all while we have a basic

642
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:43,120
design that you're working with them then you try to develop operational procedures to make

643
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,500
the system work in as many contingencies as possible so anyway that's that's the deal

644
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:56,360
you basically are rolling around the velocity vector to control both your energy and you're

645
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:07,430
you cross until it's advantage that at 20 of Europe your elements that you're ones

646
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:13,860
actually get pitch effectively and so you you disable the pitch jets and both of

647
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,810
the pitch and the role

648
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:20,950
are controlled by the the ones the vertical stabilizer as you can see is in

649
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:26,460
the shadow and so actually you don't get your infectivity of the vertical stabilizer until

650
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:32,390
just about transonic and subsonic when you actually do the final pitch over to get

651
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:37,390
ready for the going into the having a wide circle and and that's why sometimes

652
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,200
if you've seen pictures of the shuttle

653
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:44,790
as it approaches the landing at Kennedy Space Center see plumes coming out the side

654
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:49,990
and that's the origin of your students with Austria switches still firing because it's still

655
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:55,390
supersonic when it when it gets over the space and you can actually if you're

656
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,870
on the ground you hear this double sonic boom which is which is pretty impressive

657
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:03,030
cool because you don't want from the from 1 from the back of the vehicle

658
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:11,350
source of all of this and the goes around so that's a good and and

659
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:16,570
then of course you're you're flying in you hit the atmosphere at mach 25 and

660
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:27,870
so you're going through this entire aerodynamic down to hide through hypersonic supersonic transonic subsonic

661
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:36,160
and I remember was backstage gave us a little talk about how the aerodynamic coefficients

662
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:41,230
you're talking about how we had together but they change at different lot numbers right

663
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:47,450
and so you know there was the and we mentioned this before you know why

664
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:53,070
you really need a fly-by-wire system on this vehicle because the control laws that you're

665
00:41:53,070 --> 00:42:02,310
using to in order to do with the of maneuvered at at 15 are different

666
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,890
from the usual maneuvered market

667
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:11,740
of this program test inputs you can hardly see that you really didn't feel there

668
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:17,760
were just a couple of degrees you know that you would move the stick it

669
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:24,360
just little things but that collected enough data to to

670
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:29,240
get a much better determination of these coefficients very sensitive to things like you know

671
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,280
beta angle you know probably about 2 degrees you know if you called for more

672
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,530
than that that's actually

673
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:41,230
when you read the detailed description of the loss of Columbia you know when they

674
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:48,110
had penetration of the of the forward edge of the of the way that disturb

675
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:54,740
the airflow and so they were actually the control system was was fighting you know

676
00:42:55,210 --> 00:43:02,250
really valiant fight to keep Columbia on target and added in other words they could

677
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:06,900
see that on the ground that there was there was more of aerodynamic surface activity

678
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,740
in the RCS jets kicked in

679
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:14,650
in the and of course you want out of control authority of

680
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,100
a new beliefs

681
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,750
OK so something else it's closed under action

682
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,340
so these are all functions but what we're gonna right winger write the meaning fixed

683
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:39,480
forms all right k plus five k minus five

684
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,400
OK so for

685
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:45,060
belief expansion let's try to look at what might be some intuitive properties of the

686
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,380
function class

687
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:50,890
which is the saying case expanded

688
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,360
in this case OK we can expand k by alpha

689
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:01,850
OK so the first form the first partially we might add is that

690
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,380
if i k

691
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,310
so please

692
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:13,650
it's called one stuff like that

693
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:35,050
the thing is it skips forward and then there why does

694
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:39,360
OK the first once says is so hopefully doesn't have started ten

695
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,050
then if i have a sentence alpha

696
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,330
and i have beliefs OK

697
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:49,200
cable selfish should also be implicit so that's our principle of categorial action

698
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:54,060
six months is that well if i expand k by operation into believing alpha alpha

699
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,520
is now resulting c

700
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,820
then one says well i should end up with some thing which is at least

701
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:05,160
as big as i started so that never end up giving up anything i should

702
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,030
end up with more

703
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:09,750
releases much possibly more stuff

704
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,270
the fourth one says well if i already believe k one then i should do

705
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:17,040
nothing minimal change so i don't know

706
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:20,880
the fifth one is the monotonicity property and again sort of try to capture the

707
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,270
notion of minimal change in it says well if i've got to believe that one's

708
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:28,690
at least because the other than when i expand

709
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:33,490
each of them i should in the relative expansion should be at least as being

710
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,280
and the last one

711
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,770
he says that for all believe sets

712
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,940
what you end up with should be the smallest set of formulas that satisfies the

713
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,170
properties above

714
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:45,070
this again this really directly

715
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:47,980
captures my change

716
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,190
perhaps surprisingly for some of you get

717
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,910
the amount of logic that you're familiar with not so surprising it turns out there's

718
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:00,530
only one function that satisfies these properties and it's the function the consequent function essentially

719
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:07,110
so if we just take our current beliefs that we have alpha closer to action

720
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,340
and we define k plus alpha in that way

721
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:12,600
that function is exactly

722
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,340
characterized by cables one to k six

723
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:19,780
so that tells us that function that you know expansion is a fairly straightforward operation

724
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:22,310
then it can be achieved by consequent question

725
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:26,430
so contraction revision things turned out to be less difficult

726
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,690
the other thing to keep in mind is that we all interested in is looking

727
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,080
at all of the

728
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,940
you know rational functions that satisfy these properties were not necessarily in telling you which

729
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,540
one to apply

730
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:47,650
this AGM approach is not prescriptive framework in which tells you how to do something

731
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,950
always trying to do is figure out of one of the class of rational functions

732
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:55,750
that are able to achieve the best belief change criteria

733
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:59,070
i believe contraction belief revision so

734
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:04,080
OK so let's just take a particular fairly simple example where got i explicitly told

735
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,690
you the following formulas are my beliefs

736
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,760
if it rains the grass gets which is currently reigning

737
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,430
if the shop is open

738
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,480
the sorry shop is currently up and the shop is open in the light in

739
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,100
the shop is on

740
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,750
now suppose we want to give up belief in the grasping with

741
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,310
i've given you sort of three possible options here

742
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:31,060
we've got to remove one of the two sentences

743
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:32,410
it is currently right

744
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,490
and then if it rains the across gets way

745
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:37,440
and we've got a choice between this and we said before that

746
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,310
in logical criteria line doesn't really help us

747
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:43,250
and i've given you three possibilities

748
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,100
the first one

749
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,810
is that we're the fact that currently

750
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:51,420
the second one i removed the fact that if it rains then the grass gets

751
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,200
and the third one i removed but

752
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,790
so the question to you is which option would you vote for is the most

753
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,600
intuitive option coming out of contraction

754
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,910
like option a or the fact that it's currently reigning would you go with option

755
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,090
the way you remove this sort rule

756
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,800
if you raised the grass gets way

757
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:11,360
or would you go with c

758
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:13,490
but there are

759
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:15,860
so everything side

760
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,990
OK guys

761
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:19,660
why i

762
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,340
it just seems like the choice right

763
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:28,600
beautiful great that's great thing that's a brilliant said just so the idea was it's

764
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,240
easy to get rid of a single piece of knowledge rather than

765
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:35,690
you know something more complex rules rules tend to be universally true like also like

766
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:39,460
then it uses certain person mister decision tree pruning technique

767
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:44,240
on the training set itself and it also has a way of transforming the decision

768
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,700
tree into a set of rules

769
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,930
and then pruning the rules

770
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,570
which means

771
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:55,050
putting away some attribute values from the description of the rules

772
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:58,120
so just to provide some intuition

773
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:05,370
you could estimate the error in a certain node of the decision tree

774
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:09,700
suppose we are only looking at the training set we don't have a separate validation

775
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,430
set and we estimate the error in this or not

776
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:19,390
when the n is the number of examples in the note of which he examples

777
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:25,440
are erroneously classified and then we have an certain upper limit to the standard deviation

778
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:32,010
of the error which assumes certain group probability distribution

779
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:35,160
moreover in the note

780
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,480
and then what is the backup power it looks at the

781
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,410
instances in the

782
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,120
well when you have split

783
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:47,380
the set of instances into subsets you look at the

784
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,710
are in the subset

785
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,990
two which came with a certain value of the attribute

786
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:58,370
and you have multiplied with the number of instances in that subset you have the

787
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,380
estimate of the error in the other subset

788
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,310
multiplying it with the number of instances leading

789
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:09,820
in the other subset and then you compare it the

790
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:16,150
and are static error is smaller than the error which would make after splitting then

791
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:21,360
obviously this painting is not such a good idea and you should better stop despite

792
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:26,660
OK the other approach would be that you convert the decision tree to the set

793
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,460
of rules

794
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,570
and then

795
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:33,530
you prune each of the rules separately but pruning of rules this part of the

796
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:38,090
chapter on ruler to talk about

797
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,900
rule pruning in that particular

798
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:48,170
in in in that chapter so another way when you stop for instance if we

799
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:55,040
will decide through the decision tree with the so-called pre pruning technique who one obviously

800
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,570
would be well

801
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,800
i will stop

802
00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:01,850
decision to construction if the number of examples in the certain low

803
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,590
you know this too small

804
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,290
that's a less than thirty three percent of all the examples

805
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,610
that's one way of

806
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,650
to stop

807
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:16,020
six discourse structure or even the percentage of

808
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:23,480
values of one class let's say is higher

809
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:25,390
then ninety five percent

810
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:32,270
such heuristic approaches to deciding when to stop the construction of the decision tree but

811
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:37,930
it turns out that it's better to construct the entire decision tree and then say

812
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,820
well what would happen if i prove

813
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:46,890
here so i see how many examples would possibly be wrongly classified here

814
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,660
how many would be

815
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:54,840
with with such a decision tree or with the decision to see

816
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,770
with which i have

817
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:02,450
split this node further and and if the errors which would be made by a

818
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,640
large decision tree her

819
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:10,620
bigger than by smaller decision tree obviously you will be happy to build

820
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,810
smaller decision tree

821
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:16,520
there are different algorithms i have mentioned i disagree

822
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:20,530
which is the parent algorithm of for this family of decision tree learners

823
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,160
i can mention cart

824
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:26,920
that was an early decision tree learning algorithm which was developed in the early on

825
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:34,670
our colleagues to sneak bratko canonical copy and there were many for development of this

826
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:36,650
algorithm to be honest well

827
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:44,150
assistant assistant professional than many aggression tree learners and so on and so on

828
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,400
well known

829
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:53,120
algorithm developed from IDC is c four point five developed by queen

830
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,640
and also for the professional development c five

831
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:02,220
and one variant of simple twenty four point five is also implemented in the wake

832
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:08,370
of decision is in the wake of data mining workbench

833
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:13,130
so there are some other issues which such a learning algorithm has to do it

834
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:16,030
so what do do with unknown values

835
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:21,300
if in the table not all the values are present summer and we call them

836
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:25,080
unknown values or and there are some missing values

837
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:29,090
and then one option is simply to assign

838
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:32,020
the probabilistic distribution of different values

839
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:38,010
in that case and in the class classification you follow all the branches way with

840
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:43,090
winning so much of punctual into the tank from the attach point in the front

841
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:48,670
so much punch loads into the tank on the banking and S. R. B. and

842
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:52,710
we have all the gambling before forward on the flight performance calculations the wind shears

843
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:57,670
the wind gusts and we assure yourself that we don't violate any of the load

844
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,870
indicators but that does not say the vehicle save then genus fires that went through

845
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:08,350
that gives all those conditions that go structures people and they analyze a hand of

846
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:15,310
it OK they look at all the cracks and crevices and and if you got

847
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,810
people that don't have a cooperative spirit

848
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,720
it won't work

849
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,990
it just doesn't work

850
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:27,210
so you learn how to get along with the bodies over on the other side

851
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:32,740
and and don't know 5 tumor that you also begin you control your own destiny

852
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,580
because you don't

853
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:39,820
and we had a super group of people to work with and and to me

854
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:44,420
that's what really preliminary work centered on heating about way and they give us a

855
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:50,560
heating indicators and it was found judgmental more straightforward with gives accused of local sticking

856
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:55,190
out references and we that the through multitude references and we're given well-defined set of

857
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,440
trajectories and they would analyze it in detail

858
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,530
but it's

859
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:05,700
allocated the use a problem and I can work it like a piece of and

860
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,170
on this problem globally down to the center then go on in this space in

861
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:14,200
this space then work that way you start around the edges and a new Sakhalin

862
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:20,200
and finally get to read all about that but you

863
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:25,950
accomplish around the edges 1st and work out you bigger problems and then get them

864
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,020
this that the energy necessary for all

865
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:39,810
I wanted to find out what some of the things based on the same opportunities

866
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:45,230
part of the problem is that

867
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:57,990
that's a good thing if it was something that was that was previously this on

868
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:05,530
I think it was found that only we lost the increased drag a little bit

869
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:13,780
but not enough to to returning bank and a and then managed bother meaning that

870
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:17,990
nobody went down by 0 . 0 0 1 but not the fellas that will

871
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,680
find it and they they got in there and that the against go around the

872
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,750
heck and I'm still involved with an example here and there but all that all

873
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:33,030
that was done in a much more systems integration and you got include the crew

874
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:38,260
junaci system above them in eroded by the instructions about it but you still got

875
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:46,220
fly and documents and it will be that you don't want the pilots talking bad

876
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:51,330
Apache airplanes in the borders the of the of the it'll give you grew at

877
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:57,750
the head of the black death but dance you questions and no 1 not not

878
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,570
really to do

879
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:06,460
meet the requirements it's going pretty much the same way we find designed today you

880
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,860
know OK let's go by the same requirements now and you give me a difference

881
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:15,420
set requirement is not all going to same it something

882
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:20,250
I want you to think that

883
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,860
cannot that that's not a joke this right

884
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:29,670
at the origins of the members of the board of the graph

885
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:37,830
the beneficial . the parts that cannot cannot cycling and I give a picture moment

886
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,330
and increase my left

887
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:47,070
if it's only after the vehicle when I get a picture moment and decreased

888
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:52,620
also cannot wonderful but what can large do is it fouls up the flow over

889
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,090
all the rescue vehicle

890
00:57:55,420 --> 00:58:03,220
and so I've got a total unsteady you back back to here I've got 1

891
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,500
configurations unsteady aerodynamics heating

892
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:11,470
this configuration cannot there now got

893
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:17,700
2 more configurations 3 more configurations for more far more sex more and

894
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:22,690
it is there's a lot of grief with Vortexes and stuff like that he had

895
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:30,010
added and you have to have it can't and have it OK so that in

896
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:35,630
the initial and it operates marginalize I wouldn't but cannot on if we had another

897
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:59,140
this year at the time of writing here instead question generally half of all

898
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,720
the raven must be black

899
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,020
so this thing

900
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,010
is then one

901
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:07,950
now we're trying to deal with these two expressions here

902
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:12,220
now for in order to resolve this we need to make an assumption and we'll

903
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:16,340
come back to that assumption later ends and maybe see if it's a good assumption

904
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:22,160
or not the assumption here is that being erased is independent of the truth value

905
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,370
of this hypothesis so the probability that a is the raven

906
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:28,590
given that the but this is not true

907
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,430
is the same as the probability that something is or even given that it is

908
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,810
well this

909
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:38,490
i don't think about it i think it's a pretty good one

910
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:42,500
i mean i don't really have a fundamental problem with that but it's not absolute

911
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,040
right it's really an assumption that we make so for example i think about the

912
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,070
case that there was only a limited amount of black

913
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,310
available to collaborate

914
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,110
in our universe

915
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,930
would then still be true

916
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:01,330
good assumption i think but

917
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,400
can be attacked fundamental philosophical level

918
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:11,000
let's continue this so this

919
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:15,430
this racial was one and this thing was one so this was using this assumption

920
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:18,660
and this is pretty clear that this is one so what remains is this expression

921
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:26,900
and that's what we have here and that's called that eta one this probability here

922
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:30,950
and it represents all believe that given raven

923
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:36,150
is black and the assumption that not all ravens are black so this year but

924
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,550
is not all ravens are black

925
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:45,160
you have to understand that this hypothesis compact compatible with a lot of things for

926
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,680
example no right from could be like

927
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:50,190
almost all ravens could be blank

928
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:55,950
right that's compatible with this with this negated hypotheses here

929
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,790
so now we just like in this eta one into our plausibility measure this is

930
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:06,780
were formerly this ratio was and i just like the one here and we see

931
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:11,540
that we can get good confirmation from this measure this measure can become greater than

932
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:17,230
obviously becomes greater than one if the denominator is smaller than one

933
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:24,490
so confirmation is greatest if initially we don't have too strong belief into the hypothesis

934
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:31,050
and more importantly evidence dependent if this eta one is less than one or even

935
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:35,950
much less the smaller it is the more confirmation we can get here and it's

936
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:38,900
really quite unbounded i mean if

937
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:43,810
if this probability if if we assume this probability to be very small then we

938
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:49,650
can get a lot of confirmation in this theory from observing black ravens into our

939
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:52,060
belief that all ravens are black

940
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:53,470
so that's

941
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:56,790
pretty good that's what we want to write it was one of the conditions to

942
01:01:56,790 --> 01:02:04,770
resolve the paradox of theory has to somehow explain why if we observed ravens and

943
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:09,620
and the hypothesis doesn't get refuted but we believe somewhat more in that

944
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:16,510
so now let's consider the second type of evidence non-black non ravens

945
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:20,020
this observation is an object that is

946
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:24,940
another reason and that is not black so again we consider this racial here which

947
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:31,960
is the crucial data dependent quantity in our measure of confirmation we just like in

948
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:37,200
this expression here for two and here three two and now again

949
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:42,290
we use the trick of taking that apart by writing the probability of this and

950
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:48,950
of our is the probability of are given b b you just have to consider

951
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:50,920
this whole thing has

952
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:54,770
as an expression and then it's just the the old rule we know you know

953
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:58,050
that in the numerator and the denominator

954
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,910
now we try to use the same

955
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,000
trick or a set of tricks that we did before now

956
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:10,050
the hypothesis is that all non-black objects are not to ravens

957
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:15,070
this is just equivalent to the original hypothesis that every race this black so we

958
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:21,580
if we believe in this hypothesis here in something is not black then it cannot

959
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,820
be erased

960
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,460
so this expression here is one again

961
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:31,810
so we got rid of it remains to analyse this pair here and again we

962
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:38,130
would like to argue that this thing is equal to this thing and

963
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:44,160
so written spelled out that would be the probability that something is not black given

964
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,900
that we don't believe in the hypothesis is the same as the probability of something

965
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:53,440
is not like given that we believe in the hypothesis is essentially the same game

966
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:58,210
the same type of assumption that we made earlier with being ravens depending on not

967
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,630
depending on the hypothesis

968
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:05,880
so if we believe this assumption and these two are equal

969
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:12,210
this thing is one and what remains this expression here

970
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:18,470
so i've just taken that out against our racial here is now this probability here

971
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,610
and i find that to be one minus along so

972
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:26,290
the probability of are given this stuff is

973
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:31,890
epsilon and that's what's written here so epsilon is the probability of of

974
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:36,330
a being erased from given that it's not a black and we don't believe the

975
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:42,610
and now we would like to to show that this quantity is very small

976
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:47,060
because if it's very small then there's very little confirmation

977
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:50,440
now do we do that first of all we express

978
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:56,200
this conditional probability again using the basic rules as the joint probability of it being

979
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,970
erased from and it not being black

980
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:03,770
divided by the probability that it's not a black standard probability

981
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,620
calculus here

982
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:06,880
and now

983
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,890
what we can do is we can upper bound this quantity by just dropping this

984

hello and welcome to six o one

989
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:43,380
i'm denny freeman intellectual

990
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,500
one thing you should know about today is that there is a single handout you

991
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,640
should picked up on the way and the availability the two doors

992
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:54,330
what i wanna do today

993
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,150
in this first lecture

994
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,070
is mostly focus on contact

995
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,040
but before i do there

996
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,250
since excel one is a little bit of an unusual course give you a little

997
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:09,750
bit of an overview and tell you a little bit about the administration the course

998
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,110
six o one

999
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:15,030
is it

1000
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:20,030
about modes reasoning

1001
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:26,050
what we would like you to get out of this course is ways to think about engineering

1002
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:33,360
we want to talk about how you design how do you build how do you construct how do you debug

1003
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,230
complicated systems

1004
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,540
that's what engineers do

1005
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,070
and we are very good at it

1006
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,660
and now we wanna make very good at it

1007
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:49,490
we are very good at it and you know that's from your common everyday experience laptops are incredible

1008
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:53,070
as we go through the course you're gonna see

1009
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:57,750
the laptops incorporated things from the tiniest tiniest level

1010
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:05,000
things so small that you can see that the microscopic individual transistors are not things that you can see

1011
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:09,080
we develop special tools for ryu even to be able to visualize

1012
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:16,800
and yet we conglomerates billions of them into a system that works relatively reliable and

1013
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,220
i realized going out on a limb

1014
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:21,390
because you when you say things like i think always fail but

1015
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:24,440
i'll go out on a limb and say for the most part

1016
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:28,110
the systems that we construct are very reliable

1017
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,430
we'd like you to know

1018
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:35,590
how you think about making such a complicated system and making it reliable

1019
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:39,230
we want to tell you about how you would model things

1020
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:43,710
how do you gain insight how do you get predictability how do you figure out

1021
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,950
how something will work before you've built it

1022
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:50,990
if you are limited to try out

1023
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:53,950
how things work by actually constructing

1024
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,510
you spend a lot time constructing things never make it

1025
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:00,350
we want to avoid back

1026
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:02,200
why where we can

1027
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:06,240
making a model analyzing the model making a prediction from the model

1028
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:08,560
and you using the prediction

1029
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,480
can build a better system on the first try

1030
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,650
we want to tell you about how

1031
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:20,850
to augment the physical behavior of the system by putting computation and it

1032
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:22,610
that's a very

1033
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:29,110
a powerful technique that is increasingly common in anything from a microwave to a refrigerator

1034
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:32,800
we'd like you to know the principles by which you do there

1035
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:38,070
and we like you'd to be able to build systems that are robust a failure

1036
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:40,940
that's a new idea

1037
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,230
it's something that people are very good at

1038
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:49,300
if we try to do something and we make a mistake we know how to fix it

1039
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:51,640
and often the fix works

1040
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:58,670
were less good at doing back in constructing artificial systems in engineering systems and we'd

1041
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:00,810
like to talk about principles by which we can do that

1042
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:05,550
so the goal of six o one is then really to convey

1043
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:07,250
i distinct perspective

1044
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,020
about how we engineered systems

1045
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:13,540
now having said back

1046
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:16,120
this is not a philosophy course

1047
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:21,860
we are not going to make lists of things to do if you wanted to be robust

1048
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:28,790
we're going to learn to do things by actually making systems this is an introductory

1049
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:31,310
engineering course and so you're gonna build things

1050
01:09:32,530 --> 01:09:36,860
the idea is going to be that in constructing these things we would be exercises

1051
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:40,490
so that some of those important themes become transparent

1052
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:46,730
so we the idea is this is introductory engineering you're all make things

1053
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:48,690
you'll get things to work

1054
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:52,660
and in the process of doing the act learn something about the bigger view

1055
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:56,030
our quality engineering happens

1056
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,660
so the cell

1057
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,970
despite the fact that we really about motive reasoning

1058
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,970
that's would be grounded in contact

1059
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:11,950
we selected the content very broadly from across easy yes yes is an enormous endeavor

1060
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:19,460
we cannot possibly introduce everything about easy yes in one subject that's ridiculous

1061
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:25,070
however we wanted to give you a variety we wanted to give you a sense

1062
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:27,460
with a variety of tasks that you can use

1063
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:31,970
the you can add that you can apply the same techniques to all so we

1064
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,900
want to introduce motive reasoning and show you explicitly

1065
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:39,320
how you can use those modes of reasoning in a variety of contexts

1066
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:43,170
so we've chosen forum we organised a course around four modules

1067
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:48,340
first modular software engineering signals and systems and circus and probability and planning

1068
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:50,620
even so

1069
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:55,840
even having chosen just forum vast number of things we could have chosen there's no

1070
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,700
way we can tell u adequately

1071
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,300
it we can give an adequate introduction any those things easier

1072
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:05,690
what we've chosen to do instead

1073
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,290
is focus on key concepts

1074
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:10,410
represented by asterisks

1075
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:15,350
the idea is going to be we choose one or two things

1076
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:21,240
and really focus on those deeply so you get a thorough understanding not only

1077
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:26,960
how fits within for example in the context of software engineering but also

1078
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:32,610
how the concept ratifies in other areas notice that i chose i tried to choose

1079
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,170
the stars so they hit multiple circles

1080
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,970
that's what we're trying to do we're trying not only introduce an idea to yield

1081
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,200
but also show you how it connects

1082
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,190
the other ideas

1083
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,270
so the idea then is to focus on a few

1084
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:54,310
we hope very well chosen applications that will demonstrate

1085
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:56,440
a variety of powerful techniques

1086
01:11:58,690 --> 01:11:59,570
are born track

1087
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:03,080
the way we intend to go about teaching this stuff

1088
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,300
is practice

1089
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,110
there's any norm is educational literature that says

1090
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:13,960
whether you like it or not

1091
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:16,940
people learn better when they're doing things

1092
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:21,990
you have a lot of experience with a lot of experience on the other side to

1093
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:28,090
i'll try to forget the other side released right away from you your brain momentarily

1094
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:31,860
the focus on your more fundamental modes of learning

1095
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:36,000
when you were a kid and you are learning a first language

1096
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:41,840
you can learn all the rules of grammar first you can learn all the letters

1097
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,560
in the alphabet first you didn't learn about conjugating verbs first

1098
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:52,500
you've learned a little bit about language you started using iranian problems you learn a little more about language

1099
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:58,250
you learned can get to go from words like feed me

1100
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:03,160
higher level concepts like it was written

1101
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:05,880
are so the idea is

1102
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,760
that you've learned it in an iterative process where r u

1103
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,700
and made the

1104
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,870
by depriving for the for

1105
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,490
for about twelve hours

1106
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:19,450
and and then the little foot

1107
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,930
at the end of each of these are it's the a topic chips

1108
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:28,430
and i would put in the eyes of

1109
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:32,700
if i had good working memory

1110
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,080
well first of all what we're just going one to one one

1111
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:37,260
try to fix

1112
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:43,910
but it but you had to be members if you build he remembers that he

1113
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:45,700
already been this

1114
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:51,490
when he got back to the media that is not what it really well

1115
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,930
so he wants to go new

1116
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,450
so we have an opportunity here

1117
01:13:56,470 --> 01:14:01,430
no along with the i and more than ninety percent efficiency of the some training

1118
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:02,810
of basic training

1119
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:09,010
make only one billion to hear all eight ships

1120
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:12,030
so the tips the three

1121
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,450
the summit and on my heart specific problem

1122
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:18,140
this type of

1123
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,660
so this is the standard miles

1124
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:27,700
but still working memory it says so history still working memory

1125
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,810
it's easier than that

1126
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:33,930
then the what models is going to do but nevertheless

1127
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:41,280
so instead of try to remember that the models has to be there

1128
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:57,570
leo goals this the standard miles

1129
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:00,910
it's a mistake

1130
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:02,390
the is still

1131
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:04,100
well yes

1132
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:10,030
second best school couldn't remember that

1133
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:21,990
now i show you another your it's not a name it is that this is

1134
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:25,870
a good thing and then called the sharing

1135
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:30,140
and again it's on only the part of the brain in part of the brain

1136
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:32,950
causing arranging if it is deleted

1137
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:34,260
it's not about

1138
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:36,330
let's see

1139
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:37,570
if we would

1140
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:40,330
if you know this thing

1141
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:47,260
it's like this the ipod is easy because any of these

1142
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:53,510
because one more difficult than they were to make mistake here is that making mistakes

1143
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,390
another mistake

1144
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,220
the mistake that

1145
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,890
make lots of mistakes

1146
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:03,280
in the past government

1147
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:06,280
difficult one more difficult

1148
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:13,830
well the cross

1149
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:21,800
the was actually this is what be speed up in the experiment the each feature

1150
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,950
because we have a few seconds of

1151
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:30,870
the holding models in the central area in little that's so that was would not

1152
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:33,450
take the city and strategy

1153
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:36,570
one of the next

1154
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:40,870
they can do that and that the strategy canvas independent

1155
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:45,080
o to see that i missed it

1156
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,450
all right so

1157
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:49,830
i was just a

1158
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:53,330
the there bit about the memory thing because

1159
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:55,760
this is the research we would

1160
01:16:56,690 --> 01:17:02,780
in this kind of signaling enzymes it's enzyme which put the phosphate group into some

1161
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:09,390
and we were interested in the occurrence of this particular gene for the study of

1162
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,580
i can see

1163
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:13,660
mechanism for working memory but it can't

1164
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:19,850
this led to the the new project

1165
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:23,220
mechanism for schizophrenia

1166
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:26,260
they ask suffering patients are known to be

1167
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:29,120
in working memory

1168
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:30,510
and that we knew

1169
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:35,350
then one of my possible to you should be to continue continued this miles

1170
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,330
well i do other tasks

1171
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:38,950
o two pest

1172
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:40,620
the features

1173
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:47,870
article fools impairment recognizing the human suffering patients such as a patients

1174
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:51,200
social interactions

1175
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,600
in the fall and the kind of these models

1176
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,490
it had amazing

1177
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:57,300
this similarity

1178
01:17:57,330 --> 01:18:01,910
in terms of deficit in the features

1179
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:05,100
and we believe this is a very good model

1180
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:10,760
animal model horse for schizophrenia in fact that we were all one step further and

1181
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:12,490
corroborated with

1182
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:18,620
prof there someone and the rockefeller university with the very large set of tasks of

1183
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:20,140
humans pretty near

1184
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:21,490
patient the DNA

1185
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:28,120
and we did the so-called associated genetic association studies of this kind of thinking

1186
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:31,160
and we have very good evidence that at least

1187
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,330
this team

1188
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:34,330
contribute significantly

1189
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:38,470
increase the sensitivity of schizophrenia in human

1190
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:41,760
so this is not technology it's very good

1191
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:46,160
powerful in understanding basic mechanism but also can contribute

1192
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:49,720
one more try areas by providing

1193
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,570
identifying more accurate target

1194
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:56,780
the of of the of the drugs

1195
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:02,310
we we we we plan to extend this study

1196
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:09,140
possible development of new set up

1197
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:13,200
have they identified the so the total size of working memory from

1198
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:17,850
the size of working memory could be sixteen or policy

1199
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,300
it is

1200
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:25,370
this has not been done

1201
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:30,470
it will become more technically difficult to do that

1202
01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:33,430
the you know what they will not do

1203
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:37,180
in all animals with mixing up

1204
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:41,440
i will give a short demo short presentation about extracting sentiment

1205
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:44,900
sentiment on financial objects such as stocks

1206
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:46,690
from twitter posts

1207
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:53,710
most a few i guess you know what we do is

1208
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:56,890
it's about platform for sending short messages

1209
01:19:57,470 --> 01:19:58,480
kind of like guess a mess

1210
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:04,680
but the difference is that has a mess is one to one more like a channel and then twitter is

1211
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,420
in kind of channel

1212
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:11,920
this is a typical to the page it's actually our project page where we

1213
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:16,300
where we would advertised events we would point out some

1214
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:18,850
interesting stuff that we find on the web

1215
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:21,310
and so we would

1216
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:23,280
talk about our research programs

1217
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,460
and a lot of people are tweeting so

1218
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:28,330
it's estimated that

1219
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:29,690
there is

1220
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,080
two hundred

1221
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:34,120
i two hundred twenty million users

1222
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:36,000
and in two thousand ten

1223
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:40,210
they have added one hundred million accounts right so these are big numbers

1224
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:45,300
and all these people produce roughly sixty five million tweets everyday

1225
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,360
we do is accessible from practically anywhere

1226
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,260
obviously from your computer

1227
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:54,360
right from your smartphone

1228
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,040
minister bit phone

1229
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:57,730
from a space station

1230
01:20:58,590 --> 01:20:59,720
and so on right

1231
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:03,290
give you an idea

1232
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,440
how much traffic is generated on twitter

1233
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,270
when michael jackson died right

1234
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:12,370
a four hundred and fifty

1235
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:17,250
roughly four hundred and fifty tweets per second were generated about this event

1236
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,120
when steve jobs died

1237
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:22,490
ten thousand tweets were generated by this event

1238
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,650
and there's this record's

1239
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:26,720
twenty five

1240
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:28,570
thousand tweets per second

1241
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:32,070
when in japan they were screening cartoon called

1242
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:33,360
i guess so in the sky

1243
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:36,590
so these are some

1244
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:37,410
to give you

1245
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:38,880
an idea of

1246
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,440
how much traffic is there

1247
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:42,400
of course you know this traffic

1248
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:49,190
there's also a lot of people talking talking about finance about stock trading about companies and about

1249
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:51,350
four x and so on

1250
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,330
they would use something called

1251
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:57,350
dollars signed dollar sign convention

1252
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:58,760
i would

1253
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,940
just gives here's some examples so

1254
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:09,280
so there's this one user here saying that apple is making an announcement at nine am on what

1255
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:12,450
what it plans to do with scale with its cash right

1256
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:18,630
when the user says apple he doesn't say apple but it puts a dollar sign inputs the

1257
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:20,710
stock ticker symbol right

1258
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:23,300
so this is very good because we can

1259
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:28,040
from from all these masses of tweets we can extract

1260
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,260
tweets talking about stock trading and companies

1261
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:32,690
by searching

1262
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,630
by searching for these

1263
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:36,560
kind of

1264
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:38,670
dollar signs

1265
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:44,390
so what we do is we acquire roughly thirteen thousand tweets every weekday

1266
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:51,310
and this is on roughly one hundred and one thousand eight hundred stocks like google

1267
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,470
he very yahoo and so on

1268
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:55,720
and we can analyse the

1269
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,370
vocabulary in streets

1270
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:00,250
to determine the sentiment whether it's positive

1271
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:01,560
are negative

1272
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:06,100
so i would like to know shoyu

1273
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:09,000
the two them as

1274
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:10,240
and the first one

1275
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,930
i have it in detail

1276
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:17,350
the reader has call-outs you know these bubbles

1277
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:21,360
with text but i will basically them to you so you don't have to

1278
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:25,090
these are comes

1279
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:29,300
this system that we have developed in the user expresses his interest

1280
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:32,560
in this case it's about europe again you can see this

1281
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,500
he uses the dollar sign convention here

1282
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:36,560
so the

1283
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:42,260
tweets about iraq are returned so that beta is credited for tweets about europe

1284
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:45,920
and the results and then the vocabulary is analyzed in the results

1285
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:47,680
are presented to the user

1286
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,490
so she see that we have collected one hundred twenty in total

1287
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:52,760
and we have

1288
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:54,020
thrown out

1289
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:55,920
roughly half of them

1290
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,470
they were near duplicates and non-english tweets so we remove those

1291
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:05,640
and we are left with roughly fifty five percent of negative weights

1292
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:08,890
and forty five percent of positive

1293
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,420
if we look at some concrete examples

1294
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:18,110
there's one saying that

1295
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,910
euro versus the dollar closed below weekly what i guess this is some stock

1296
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:25,760
in this tweets uh

1297
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,890
what happens is that we have some function here

1298
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:33,200
i'm going from one to o which depends on the y and y one

1299
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:35,550
the data that

1300
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,990
OK just write about in that way

1301
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:44,600
i think it might depends on why i depends on y that what we get

1302
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,700
the maximum

1303
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,030
well we want to maximize the otherwise

1304
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:52,780
this summer all

1305
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,390
well i can just say well i think maximize the y two up y o

1306
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:57,910
and the first

1307
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:03,570
and things all the terms except for the first one don't really depend on y

1308
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:10,820
to y one i can push the maximisation over y one slide here

1309
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:14,180
they knew what the value of y two was i could just work out what

1310
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:15,970
the optimal value y one

1311
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:21,360
i'm going to to trust

1312
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:23,840
compute for all possible values of y two

1313
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:27,120
but the optimal value of this is with respect to y one

1314
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,140
i'm going to

1315
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,390
called the functionality of what

1316
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:35,050
is not eliminated why what

1317
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:37,550
nine to write the function

1318
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:40,640
instance you want to write about the more

1319
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,430
and i'm going to war

1320
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,160
why one would have chosen

1321
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,970
for any of the what

1322
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:53,180
i mean i'm going to push y two into this optimisation

1323
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,800
i'm going to get to of the y two

1324
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:57,490
if y two y three

1325
01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:59,220
and you have to apply to

1326
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:02,820
and now i can play the same game for y two is is what they

1327
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:05,120
i'm going to do

1328
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:08,260
the a function of y three would paint

1329
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,260
with many

1330
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:13,320
immediately incorporate the optimal value of what

1331
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:15,970
they can do it why

1332
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,890
y three y four and so on

1333
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:19,800
but have recursion

1334
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:22,410
at the end of the recursion will want to have

1335
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:25,550
perhaps the optimal value of it

1336
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:28,680
which is kind of cool but useless otherwise

1337
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:34,640
but i also know what the last term in the sequence has to be

1338
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:39,140
and now i can do the following can just work my way back work

1339
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,530
it's just like when you terrible piece of

1340
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:42,910
fabric and you

1341
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:44,970
remove the last trading you just

1342
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:46,620
unravel it

1343
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:49,910
so this is really what's happening we now know the last time we can work

1344
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:54,780
out the second last for that is a simple table look-up india

1345
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:56,930
so what you really doing is

1346
01:26:57,010 --> 01:27:03,200
viterbi algorithm forward backward part and that's it

1347
01:27:03,970 --> 01:27:07,220
it question so that the moment

1348
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:10,030
they have a a very complicated now

1349
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:20,490
exactly so

1350
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:22,010
let me repeat the question

1351
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:24,930
i am looking for the most violated constraint

1352
01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:26,300
and if so

1353
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:29,370
both in that he incorporated the l one

1354
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:33,950
the copyright and that i was trying to make the equations because simple

1355
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:35,340
so first of all

1356
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,740
if you look at the o one loss

1357
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:39,370
this can be written out

1358
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:42,780
as a function of basic is some of the

1359
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:46,640
the differences between why i and y i brought

1360
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:50,280
these are functions that depend just on a single variable

1361
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:53,510
so regardless of whether i want to do the prediction

1362
01:27:53,530 --> 01:27:57,740
at this time with i want to find the most violated constraint

1363
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:02,800
i will still get some function which depend on y and y one

1364
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,990
but if you want to make this substitution

1365
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:08,320
the problem is identical

1366
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,410
and all of that is that just switch

1367
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:13,200
the rock to make things look a little bit into yes

1368
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:16,450
you have to solve slightly different dynamic programming problem

1369
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:18,780
for both training and it's on

1370
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:21,390
but it's only very slightly different and

1371
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:23,950
the system looks the same

1372
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:28,510
all this slide is great regardless of the

1373
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:36,240
thanks very much so has be paid very little attention back slot

1374
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:39,640
the question

1375
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,470
if i have

1376
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,530
interest around here

1377
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:49,950
in other words will be designing for functions which depend not on y i y

1378
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:53,550
but maybe also why i

1379
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,910
they would have become interaction

1380
01:28:55,930 --> 01:29:00,140
how could i do it then

1381
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:05,660
they would have an idea

1382
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:11,160
actually whatever it is i will get some of those functions while i was one

1383
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:15,800
i could write about like that

1384
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,860
and now

1385
01:29:16,910 --> 01:29:19,740
in my dynamic programming

1386
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,470
well i could still maximize y one

1387
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:25,680
but this would then be a function of y two and y three

1388
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:29,090
the data what if ten and y two and y three

1389
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:33,370
the three with depend on y three y four and so on and so on

1390
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:40,280
in way the optimisation problem looks exactly the same except that they have brought

1391
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,570
because we before ali had this or what if

1392
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:48,030
the next variable has a value of one zero

1393
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:52,140
i no need to score what if the next and the next pair

1394
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:54,930
had the values once you like it

1395
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:57,220
wet rice

1396
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,360
if it depends on who are

1397
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:02,930
we need to store two to the three choices

1398
01:30:03,010 --> 01:30:06,910
let's assume that otherwise would only be serious ones but maybe

1399
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:09,120
at ten different

1400
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,490
then the simple dynamic programming

1401
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:12,930
because we can

1402
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:14,510
o operations rate

1403
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:16,390
every step

1404
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:20,700
one may have to take into account cost we can square the content the three

1405
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,950
so what you can see is that one

1406
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:28,230
crystallography fraser mathematicians would call the periodic repetition

1407
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:29,400
that is

1408
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:36,460
this is a translation vector in one direction here's one direction and the translation vector

1409
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:41,070
in the set the direction here is that translation vector so that if you took

1410
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:46,290
a small cut out of this you could literally stamp out this whole thing just

1411
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:50,140
with repeated translations in those two directions

1412
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:55,510
here's another another one that he did

1413
01:30:55,560 --> 01:31:01,710
and this captures several things not only the regular repetition but also notice the duality

1414
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:08,440
here for every black fish use of long pointy nose black fish and here's a

1415
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:13,670
little shorter ones much like the ones we had a moment ago there is a

1416
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:15,750
corresponding right

1417
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,260
in fact

1418
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,720
this is again this figure out

1419
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:24,180
if you could somehow list of all the black fish

1420
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:26,880
and leave the white fish

1421
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:31,920
each one of those would be perfect replicas of the other figure and ground

1422
01:31:31,930 --> 01:31:33,860
well exactly the same

1423
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:37,190
you have you can think of them as two layers you have a black layer

1424
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:41,320
and the white layer that exactly perfect images of each other

1425
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:47,900
that they actually are fit together in this jigsaw manner

1426
01:31:47,950 --> 01:31:53,690
and i'd like to take a a small

1427
01:31:56,810 --> 01:32:00,870
it's not really a detour but rather a

1428
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:05,870
if have the actual followed with regard to regular repetition

1429
01:32:07,910 --> 01:32:12,030
mathematicians and and crystallography for c as

1430
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:14,180
regular repetition

1431
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:15,690
and to begin the

1432
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:17,460
one of the first show you

1433
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:19,150
a baseline

1434
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:24,850
page of mathematical paper

1435
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:30,270
that was written in nineteen twenty three by the mathematician george polio

1436
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:34,970
this particular paper which appeared in sight refer crystallography

1437
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:37,480
brought to

1438
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,360
anxious attention by his half-brother

1439
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:43,260
who was a professor of geology

1440
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,980
at the university of lausanne

1441
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:51,440
actually the time it was nineteen thirty seven when asher learned of this session was

1442
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,910
trying to make translations

1443
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,950
he had already been twice to the alhambra

1444
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:03,440
and copy out of those beautiful mosaics in the alhambra and from those here clean

1445
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:05,650
some inkling some idea

1446
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,680
some of the geometric rules to follow

1447
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:10,850
and made about a dozen

1448
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:12,190
test relations

1449
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:20,840
he wanted his tiles to look like something not just be geometric

1450
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:25,720
but then he got stuck he had no idea that there were any general rules

1451
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:28,280
or if there were other

1452
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:29,700
ways that

1453
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:34,600
tiles interlock then the other ways in which he had observed that the alhambra

1454
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,500
and so his

1455
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:41,430
half said you know there might be some mathematical papers with pictures

1456
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,190
that would give you some help

1457
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:49,420
and this one but was actually an announcement in nineteen twenty three

1458
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,720
the whole you had proved that there are exactly seventeen

1459
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:56,040
plane crystallographic groups

1460
01:33:56,170 --> 01:34:00,200
what that means is that if you classify

1461
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:03,090
interlocking tile patterns

1462
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:08,380
o that have periodicity that is that have translation symmetry

1463
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:11,220
if you classify them according to

1464
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:12,690
which other

1465
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:18,950
isometry is that it's translations of rotations or glide reflections

1466
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,480
which of these if they act on them

1467
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:30,250
leave tiling invariant looking exactly the same so every thailand's on another tile

1468
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:31,770
if you classify

1469
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:35,020
periodic plane translations

1470
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,600
according to

1471
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:44,490
that is isometry is that leave them invariant there only seventeen classes where there are

1472
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:48,190
only seventeen symmetry groups and paul

1473
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,260
so we said make a picture

1474
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:54,970
whenever u explaining anything mathematical if you can make the picture

1475
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,200
and he was true to his own words

1476
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,120
in the paper

1477
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:04,000
he made this picture the display is one translation

1478
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:07,320
for each of the seventeen symmetry groups

1479
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:12,130
many of these are taken from well-known sources this one for example in this one

1480
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:18,300
of the on this is an obvious but apparently obvious roof pattern but some others

1481
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:20,110
he had makeup

1482
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:22,650
this one is original this one is original

1483
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:25,220
and as you can't beat all of these

1484
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,230
study in very hard

1485
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:30,390
he didn't care at all about symmetry groups

1486
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:33,030
and he never did anything with groups

1487
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:38,380
he did study these for the ways in which the tiles with interlocked to try

1488
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:43,630
to understand the isometry is governed by the interlocking of these tiles

1489
01:35:44,130 --> 01:35:46,500
and then he set out for himself

1490
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,510
the idea

1491
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:48,840
of making

1492
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,700
the whole system at

1493
01:35:53,690 --> 01:35:55,190
for himself

1494
01:35:55,210 --> 01:35:57,550
how can i make the tile

1495
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:01,870
so that i know little interlocked with copies of itself

1496
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:06,120
and i will know exactly in which way is it will interlock

1497
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:10,020
with copies of itself to make a complete isolation

1498
01:36:11,570 --> 01:36:15,390
definition that he took

1499
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:18,940
four what he called regular division of the plane

1500
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:23,200
was taken from another mathematician

1501
01:36:23,230 --> 01:36:25,120
this mathematician

1502
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:26,750
was called

1503
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:28,200
as hard

1504
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:34,200
and interestingly enough his paper was also written in nineteen twenty three actually copied this

1505
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,620
word for word

1506
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:39,220
i translated it to english it was originally in german

1507
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:41,950
the regular divisions of the plane

1508
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:47,780
consist of congruent said convex polygon tiles joined together

1509
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:52,940
the arrangement by which the tiles join each other is the same throughout

1510
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:55,030
in other words

1511
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:59,270
asher was looking for ways in which to make tiles

1512
01:36:59,290 --> 01:37:01,200
that every time

1513
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:05,480
in the test asian was surrounded in exactly the same way

1514
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:08,160
this says nothing about symmetry groups

1515
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:10,820
when you talk about symmetry groups

1516
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:13,680
you have to the cancellation looks like

1517
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:16,050
because you acting on the whole thing

1518
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:18,960
when you're making it escalation

1519
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:23,420
you take one tile and then use around it and then around that and so

1520
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:26,020
on and so forth

1521
01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:31,000
this is the definition he took this as a criterion for regularity

1522
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:34,420
every tile is surrounded the same way

1523
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:36,040
and yet

1524
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:41,980
that's not the way it is today let me just illustrate with

1525
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,280
a nice cancellation

1526
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:53,960
let me try

1527
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:57,880
straighten this up here that's a little bit better

1528
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,840
OK but

1529
01:38:00,850 --> 01:38:03,440
the bottom line and the butterfly

1530
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:06,020
and superimpose lips

1531
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:07,360
looks like i want to

1532
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:11,660
do this

1533
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:14,540
that's a super impose this on

1534
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:16,340
the butterfly

1535
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:22,090
the surrounding exactly the same way as one butterfly surrounded if i move this one

1536
01:38:22,090 --> 01:38:23,100
to show you

1537
01:38:23,110 --> 01:38:25,950
this is one butterfly surrounded by butterflies

1538
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:28,620
if i move this to a different position

1539
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,040
so put this on red butterfly

1540
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:34,470
again it exactly matches and so on

1541
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:40,200
mine and I can choose to charge them an upfront cost monthly cost don't necessarily

1542
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:44,010
recommended to do but we let you do that and then they start taking running

1543
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:46,250
it pay 20 cents an hour

1544
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:51,710
when we collect the 20 cents what we do is we keep the 10 cents

1545
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:56,120
for the underlying image and we send the different in this case another 10 cents

1546
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,030
minus the commission to you

1547
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:02,700
so it's actually that's why Satan new kinds offers service and have everything I'm talking

1548
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:08,070
about this evening I think that this is probably the biggest opportunity out there that

1549
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:10,570
if you want to know if you want to start a business and sell it

1550
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:14,050
for you know there's no boundaries national boundaries and go to such a really good

1551
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:19,400
afternoon we also make the same pricing model available with the Amazon is 3 so

1552
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:23,900
you're able to mark up to data storage in much the same

1553
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:28,230
there's derivative images size was available

1554
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:36,210
the couple 64 bit among spending time here other than to say that Frederick themselves

1555
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:40,970
for instance in 80 cents per hour that recent

1556
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:42,840
that's an awful lot of energy

1557
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:47,160
a little trivia fact that's actually quite worthless but it did

1558
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:48,310
but think about

1559
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:56,270
1 electrolyte images is equivalent to anyone remember well like you're beyond that 25 years

1560
01:39:56,270 --> 01:40:03,730
ago the Commodore 64 with the state-of-the-art for somebody who's 250 thousand Commodore 64 per

1561
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:06,460
cent of all along that

1562
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:11,750
the show you how far we've come in industry observers are questions about that but

1563
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:18,640
after years of examples of how people are using this 1st one

1564
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:23,730
it is a website that I found I called FCW its called that means Federal

1565
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:28,840
Computer Week so this is just a magazine that covers the other federal and cover

1566
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:31,250
the federal military computing know

1567
01:40:31,270 --> 01:40:37,440
the U.S. in this particular case the talking about agency inside the Pentagon Culdesac for

1568
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:40,030
Defense Information Systems Agency

1569
01:40:40,070 --> 01:40:43,770
and what they do they're just basically the I T department so they were putting

1570
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:45,460
together a prototype

1571
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:49,460
where they needed according to the story here they needed 30 thousand dollars worth of

1572
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:53,940
servers but more broadly they needed to get it approved in the 1st half of

1573
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:58,130
the Pentagon's got really really best director for the person who was

1574
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:01,900
trying to do the project and got tired of waiting for approval and got out

1575
01:41:01,910 --> 01:41:04,400
his credit card in Peru

1576
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,550
and an easy to 10 years what the project cost

1577
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:13,140
I'm sure he got in trouble for saving too much money pockets

1578
01:41:13,470 --> 01:41:16,970
but this is interested not think about it that

1579
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:22,410
it on ice tea in a minute service providers very capital-intensive business to buy all

1580
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:27,180
servers infrastructure for what started out as he

1581
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:29,070
without any capital

1582
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:36,510
what this company owned by moving people and not in Toronto Canada and what they've

1583
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:41,860
done is they've launched an idea speed for writing traditional high-speed services on top of

1584
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:47,050
Amazon's seemed so when he gets new customers you just buyers of new instances if

1585
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:52,490
you give it customers go way he turned to mark its always always making money

1586
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:56,200
and then of course he value he heads things we don't do we don't do

1587
01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:01,640
back up your system we don't do the typical call support helped in all for

1588
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:04,400
lined with people call and ask for help

1589
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:09,770
we doing it wasn't so he adds that value only made business

1590
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:11,440
I thought

1591
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,330
members talking about the meeting of minds offers a service

1592
01:42:15,730 --> 01:42:18,510
these are the 1st people to take advantage of the soul

1593
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:24,360
maybe Red Hat Enterprise Linux available for at 15 cents per hour

1594
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:28,840
but they do have a monthly fee in addition so instead of buying Red Hat

1595
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:31,960
Linux for about that

1596
01:42:31,970 --> 01:42:37,470
I chairman exact price is little over 2000 here by U.S. you can just rented

1597
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:40,320
by the hour and made a business out of this world

1598
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:43,840
here's 1 my favorite to talk about

1599
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:49,380
anyone here know about the new little algorithm called that produced

1600
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:50,800
1 2 0 0

1601
01:42:50,990 --> 01:42:54,820
some of the book itself for the rest of of your what map reduces is

1602
01:42:54,820 --> 01:43:01,030
an algorithm that Theron decision take a big computing problems in chop it into pieces

1603
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:05,960
and then you can operate on each of those pieces individual is independent of the

1604
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:11,460
others and then you solve all these little answers getting a lot of little interest

1605
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:14,470
in some of them into the final match of

1606
01:43:14,510 --> 01:43:18,490
it is the open-source implementation of that in the Dube was written by a guy

1607
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:23,110
named undercutting the works for a young man of action

1608
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:27,440
and what I'm showing a screenshot of the New York Times

1609
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:31,990
was trying to convert old articles in the PDF files so what they had was

1610
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:35,980
please convince yourself you have the time that this is the dimension one of the

1611
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:38,450
second square has the right mention

1612
01:43:38,490 --> 01:43:43,260
the by the way whenever i uses throughout this lecture is never periods it is

1613
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:44,760
always tension

1614
01:43:44,810 --> 01:43:47,390
i will stay away from the capital he

1615
01:43:47,410 --> 01:43:48,600
when we're dealing

1616
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:52,240
it was a period

1617
01:43:52,290 --> 01:43:54,640
so i can divide

1618
01:43:54,670 --> 01:43:56,440
m out

1619
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,320
and i can rewrite this

1620
01:43:58,410 --> 01:44:00,670
get an downstairs

1621
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:02,640
so we now get y

1622
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,120
of the

1623
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:07,730
double that

1624
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:11,260
what i'm going to do now i'm going to take the white here

1625
01:44:11,310 --> 01:44:13,100
and is it

1626
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:15,370
and bring them to the left

1627
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:18,470
however minus you never mind this year

1628
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:21,680
so i get lost because credit

1629
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:24,880
and while the

1630
01:44:24,930 --> 01:44:28,370
and then i'm going to win the peace minus one in going to bring the

1631
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:30,140
plus one in

1632
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:32,410
notice i have assigned here

1633
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:35,770
so i got mine is omega zero square

1634
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:40,160
plus one

1635
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:44,100
and here i have a plus minus minus the plaster when i bring back get

1636
01:44:44,130 --> 01:44:46,300
minus but i really have the miners

1637
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:48,120
so i can why

1638
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:51,120
the minus one

1639
01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:53,630
and that now equals zero

1640
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:57,050
the newton's second law

1641
01:44:57,100 --> 01:45:00,250
for particle p

1642
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:06,860
x me

1643
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,910
what is your problem

1644
01:45:09,870 --> 01:45:11,870
thank you very much

1645
01:45:11,910 --> 01:45:14,030
very good i appreciate it

1646
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:15,880
this is true because you have to

1647
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:18,590
one year

1648
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:21,510
you have one

1649
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:22,590
thank you

1650
01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:28,870
very ten

1651
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:32,840
so now we have to do this for every single object so we have

1652
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:35,740
capital and differential equations one

1653
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:38,070
for each particle

1654
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,230
the only thing

1655
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:42,130
that we have to keep in in mind now when we solve

1656
01:45:42,330 --> 01:45:46,080
y zero which refers to that location zero there

1657
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:47,900
i was always zero

1658
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:50,170
and the why and was one

1659
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:54,820
it's also

1660
01:45:54,830 --> 01:45:57,910
so if i made a sketch

1661
01:45:57,970 --> 01:46:00,620
so we have to warn you up to the idea

1662
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:04,370
and i made a sketch for only two particles

1663
01:46:04,420 --> 01:46:07,040
so it is number one

1664
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:08,750
there's number two

1665
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:12,250
this is the text that this fixed

1666
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:14,690
then you can sort of see that

1667
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:18,050
the lowest normal mode

1668
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:21,730
this is something like this

1669
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:28,200
omega minds and is going to oscillate like this

1670
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:30,820
but you can also imagine that in the

1671
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:32,510
the second mode

1672
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,660
the the highest one

1673
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,620
that number one is up

1674
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:39,070
and the number two is down

1675
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:40,660
in this situation

1676
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:43,490
and so they also made like this

1677
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:45,570
just to make you see

1678
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:47,260
i call this

1679
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:49,360
l and r equals one

1680
01:46:49,370 --> 01:46:52,620
i call these people and equals two and referring

1681
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:54,240
the moat

1682
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:56,540
mode one

1683
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,490
this and later on and this is then

1684
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:04,970
mode number two and only two modes because only two particles

1685
01:47:05,010 --> 01:47:06,380
so that is now

1686
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:12,280
with the equation that we have

1687
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:16,040
and let's write down for this system

1688
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:19,230
two differential equations

1689
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:21,820
so look at this one

1690
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,190
going to substitute

1691
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:24,010
four b

1692
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:25,720
first number one

1693
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:27,110
which is this one

1694
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:31,110
that's one differential equation then we're going to put in for the number two

1695
01:47:31,210 --> 01:47:33,490
get the second difference

1696
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:34,990
if you're ready

1697
01:47:35,070 --> 01:47:36,050
we're going to get

1698
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:38,520
why one double dot

1699
01:47:38,530 --> 01:47:41,940
plus two omega zero credit

1700
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:46,610
by one

1701
01:47:46,670 --> 01:47:48,020
mine omega

1702
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:49,900
zero credit

1703
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:51,000
and then we get

1704
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:52,260
y two

1705
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:55,630
that's this particle

1706
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:57,330
and then we get a plus

1707
01:47:57,980 --> 01:48:00,170
p minus one which is closer

1708
01:48:00,190 --> 01:48:02,380
y zero

1709
01:48:02,450 --> 01:48:04,780
which happens to be zero right away

1710
01:48:04,790 --> 01:48:07,690
because y zero is zero

1711
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:09,070
now we go to the

1712
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:10,120
this is zero

1713
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:13,650
the second particle

1714
01:48:13,730 --> 01:48:15,710
so we get y two

1715
01:48:15,730 --> 01:48:17,630
double dot

1716
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:21,160
two omega zero created

1717
01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:22,740
y two

1718
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:25,510
omega zero grid

1719
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:29,010
and now we get first people is one which is number three

1720
01:48:29,030 --> 01:48:30,630
which is why three

1721
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:32,780
which happens to be zero

1722
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:34,290
because y three

1723
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:35,350
is this point

1724
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:36,370
and that's it

1725
01:48:36,370 --> 01:48:39,270
in this specific case was only two objects

1726
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:41,790
and then you get your plus

1727
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:43,490
like minus one

1728
01:48:43,490 --> 01:48:44,770
and that is

1729
01:48:46,030 --> 01:48:48,860
i was wondering to that's why we

1730
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:52,410
and that is

1731
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:53,280
so this

1732
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:55,450
these two coupled oscillators

1733
01:48:55,460 --> 01:48:57,570
i have to be solved

1734
01:48:57,610 --> 01:49:00,030
and in the normal mode situation

1735
01:49:00,090 --> 01:49:02,410
we are clearly going to

1736
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:05,990
what this in as file function

1737
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:08,980
we get

1738
01:49:09,770 --> 01:49:13,200
they must also made with the same frequency omega otherwise

1739
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:14,450
we wouldn't be dealing

1740
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:17,050
which is normal

1741
01:49:17,070 --> 01:49:20,980
so these are trial functions are we going to put in these equations

1742
01:49:21,010 --> 01:49:22,850
and we will put them in

1743
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:24,020
number one

1744
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:26,270
going to put in number two and then

1745
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:27,470
we will put them in

1746
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:30,190
particle number p

1747
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:34,140
and then we can all the way go to an n is ten thousand after

1748
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:36,890
i don't ten thousand different equations

1749
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:38,290
i will take the rest

1750
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:40,620
of the or

1751
01:49:42,470 --> 01:49:44,790
i'm going to number one year

1752
01:49:44,850 --> 01:49:47,410
so again why one which is a one

1753
01:49:47,490 --> 01:49:51,590
the second derivative always mind is only just created

1754
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,340
is only

1755
01:49:54,350 --> 01:49:56,370
one i

1756
01:49:56,410 --> 01:50:01,270
that's the cosine omega t because each term the cosine we get

1757
01:50:01,290 --> 01:50:03,300
then they get cluster

1758
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:05,570
because it was great

1759
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:06,890
i'm able

1760
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:09,960
and then i got my

1761
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:12,490
omega zero grant

1762
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,140
eight true

1763
01:50:15,190 --> 01:50:17,260
right because now

1764
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:18,260
again get two

1765
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:21,890
is zero

1766
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:23,520
it happened to me

1767
01:50:23,530 --> 01:50:26,590
so i just put it there you will see shortly why i want to keep

1768
01:50:26,590 --> 01:50:32,320
i said that i didn't like average interval on so much

1769
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:38,570
but i mean it's a good answer in the sense that typically quite safe answer

1770
01:50:38,570 --> 01:50:43,700
conservative on in this case a ninety nine percent two two two hundred percent i

1771
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:46,770
mean it's a pretty robust answers the bad is

1772
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:50,870
inferences are not often very very weak

1773
01:50:50,890 --> 01:50:55,730
so and if you goal is really to maximize utility

1774
01:50:57,550 --> 01:51:01,420
the interval approach is not the preferred approach

1775
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:04,470
i mean you could have other goals for instance i mean you have

1776
01:51:04,730 --> 01:51:05,730
two doctors

1777
01:51:05,730 --> 01:51:07,190
into treatment

1778
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,980
different treatments one guy dies and then this

1779
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:16,170
and then you could say i can take so some modelling start with the following

1780
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:19,470
that come to the conclusion that the decisions and

1781
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:24,130
whenever any doctor chooses from this set of optimal decisions one decision then sort of

1782
01:51:24,870 --> 01:51:30,810
whatever happens i mean is theory of imprecise probabilities or confidence intervals so and i

1783
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:31,840
think it's OK

1784
01:51:32,730 --> 01:51:36,110
four for maximizing utility

1785
01:51:36,110 --> 01:51:39,340
i i would not recommend that

1786
01:51:43,410 --> 01:51:45,440
here is another paradox

1787
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,870
so i give you

1788
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:49,000
two envelopes

1789
01:51:49,020 --> 01:51:50,480
the really

1790
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:54,560
this money in the envelope

1791
01:51:57,750 --> 01:52:00,580
now scholarships call of

1792
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:05,060
and in one and the love this twice the amount and the other one thousand

1793
01:52:05,060 --> 01:52:07,110
dollars in two thousand

1794
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:10,140
five dollars ten dollars whatever

1795
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:13,130
you choose one envelope

1796
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:17,720
when you open it then you look at the money and then you have the

1797
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:22,920
decision you can either keep the money or switch to the other envelope

1798
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:24,250
so what would you do

1799
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:29,250
o would keep the envelope with the money

1800
01:52:33,870 --> 01:52:38,280
a few hundred dollars and envelope

1801
01:52:38,290 --> 01:52:39,650
just pick some number

1802
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:42,930
and on the the left in the half or double the amount of in

1803
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:49,940
you were OK with which

1804
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:54,740
who would keep it

1805
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:59,970
i would say doesn't matter

1806
01:52:59,970 --> 01:53:01,350
OK are wrong

1807
01:53:04,650 --> 01:53:09,690
we should made it now

1808
01:53:10,350 --> 01:53:15,720
OK i mean those of you that it doesn't matter probably from symmetry arguement i

1809
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:17,060
mean look i mean this is

1810
01:53:17,070 --> 01:53:20,250
completely symmetric situation i mean the end of shuffle

1811
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:24,430
it doesn't even matter but i look at it or not i mean

1812
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:25,940
i can switch or not

1813
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:28,160
was ready to begin this

1814
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:30,740
but if you do the computation

1815
01:53:32,030 --> 01:53:36,880
so with probability one half the other envelope contains them and then with probably one

1816
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,740
half twice the amount

1817
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:40,970
so let's compute expected value

1818
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:44,570
and you so with probability one half w amount of it probably one of your

1819
01:53:44,570 --> 01:53:49,040
have so the expected value one point twenty five so again

1820
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:54,750
twenty five percent in this case twenty five dollars in expectation switch

1821
01:53:55,970 --> 01:53:57,210
so because

1822
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:59,910
i mean if you follow this rule is which always

1823
01:53:59,910 --> 01:54:02,760
i mean there's leaving point looking at them but if you take the envelope and

1824
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:03,930
they say are

1825
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:13,370
so maybe you can do that you know many times

1826
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:15,430
it's more and more

1827
01:54:20,410 --> 01:54:24,530
so there was for fun but for the homework please compute the answer

1828
01:54:24,570 --> 01:54:27,720
the amount of course

1829
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:30,190
and and then you will see

1830
01:54:30,210 --> 01:54:33,250
why all answers are wrong but you gave me

1831
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:57,020
good what is life and what is small

1832
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:12,520
it depends in america the only hundred dollar in real words

1833
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:15,200
in european five hundred euro so
