1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,290
bad reasons because there are so that other the pieces up again assisted the pieces

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,700
that would be the right here you would be

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,440
backed to bit OK

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,830
so i'm going to my contributors has taken this island is that reason that you

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,930
the the because i got to be done here

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,160
we get we get them i can also hear about

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,430
so we get just point oh that's fine that's fine just just speaking to us

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,550
i was going

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,500
the like this because we would like to to do a sweep agency

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,050
it was saying

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,270
you say it compresses the rate at which does compress the range i mean i

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,870
mean if you chose

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,110
your swing from a to b minor something from the data from the past to

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,020
there's some i can arrange is but it's it's it's these these and other reasons

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,170
for choosing

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,810
the game blue in

17
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,810
it's just that the whole like this point

18
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:11,610
is that we can be more cohesive power together but it's not

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,680
the prime minister

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,310
that are

21
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:26,790
many private so that we can work together to give you

22
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,650
and what

23
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,910
so try to give you a different reason why he's saying he's saying that maybe

24
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,060
maybe some of you in the room might actually care about each other's right i

25
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,860
mean you all know each other and class you will go to the same college

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,180
for example if we if we play this game

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,070
up and up in the business school and the same is true to say that

28
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,290
i want to write will with a given the business school

29
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,560
i think it's quite likely to get a lot of alpha chosen right but if

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,400
we play this game up let's say the divinity school

31
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:08,110
i'm guessing that i'm guessing that traverses answers reflecting what you guys are going play

32
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,530
in the school you might think that people in the school might care about other

33
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,520
people's rights right there might be ethical reasons perfectly good sensible ethical reasons for choosing

34
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,860
peter in this game might be other reasons well but this fact the the reason

35
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,480
to focus on and perhaps the the lesson learned from this is that right now

36
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,610
this is not the game right now

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,720
we have actions that able to take and we know what outcomes are

38
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,660
but we're missing something that will make this again we missing

39
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,860
missing objected missing pales this what people care about

40
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,100
right so

41
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,000
because we start rising again until we know what people care about and we know

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,110
the payoffs

43
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,690
and this is the same thing how it operates against other members any other moment

44
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,640
of the cluster today it's relevant

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,190
game theory

46
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,600
professors at yale cannot tell you what you'll payoffs should be

47
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,250
you should not have the we can't i can't tell you in useful way

48
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,870
what is that used in your goals in life should be whatever

49
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,600
that's all game was about

50
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,770
however once we know what your payoffs what we know what your goals are

51
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,010
perhaps we can game theory can help you get

52
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,100
so we had two different kind of payoff mentioned here

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,130
we had the kind of payoff where

54
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,720
we care about our own great

55
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,870
and travis is mentioned kind of help we might care about other people's grades and

56
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:34,370
want to do today is how is this game on the both those possible payoffs

57
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,350
the start of

58
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:46,050
let's put up some possible payoffs of the game

59
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,400
i promise we'll come back and look at some other payoff later we will revisit

60
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,330
the divinity school later

61
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,700
so he once again is also a famous matrix with me and my parents

62
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,010
choosing actions alpha and beta

63
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,870
but this time i'm going to put numbers in here

64
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,200
and some of you

65
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,140
recognise these numbers but that's not

66
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,390
really relevant now

67
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,310
right so what's the idea of the first idea is that these numbers represent

68
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,880
you tiles utilities

69
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,160
that they represent what this what these people trying to maximize the trying to achieve

70
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,670
their goals

71
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,750
the idea is to be

72
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,430
compare this to the outcome matrix

73
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,080
the person is medium

74
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,370
yields the payoff

75
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,850
so if is this box to see you the payoff of three

76
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,110
yields a payoff

77
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,600
of zero and so

78
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,510
towards the interpretation

79
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,620
the first interpretation of the nats interpolation along you jumped straight away

80
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,330
these are people people with these payoffs of people who only care about their own

81
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,830
grades they prefer a to be plastic people have to be minus and the review

82
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,550
minus two c

83
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,400
i all the the great or otherwise run like virginia

84
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:23,590
these people only care about their rights

85
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,830
really care

86
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,580
from the centre

87
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,750
and i want to know what is here this is little or

88
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,000
from the centre

89
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,540
so let's first though

90
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,650
the potential

91
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,130
at point p

92
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,660
is an in the world

93
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,220
going from r to infinity if i take the

94
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,130
electric force

95
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,750
divided by

96
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,820
my test charge q

97
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,460
but they are

98
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:08,570
but this

99
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,350
is the electric field it this

100
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,450
force times distance his work one of his work unit

101
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,090
chart so i take my test charts out

102
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,040
and so this is the integral

103
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,950
in are infinity

104
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,760
you don't feel

105
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,870
we are sorry

106
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,030
and that's very easy grow

107
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,820
because we know what he is

108
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,690
electric field we have done several times

109
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,860
it follows immediately from growers law

110
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,990
so when you

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,690
calculate this integral

112
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,330
you get q

113
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,580
divided by

114
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,050
four by

115
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,670
absolutely zero are

116
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,880
it is no surprise because we already had that for a point charge

117
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,290
so this is the situation you are

118
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,410
there are is larger

119
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,060
then capital are

120
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,820
precisely what we had before

121
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,110
we can put in some numbers

122
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,680
if you put in are

123
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,220
he calls are

124
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,900
which is o point three metres

125
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,800
you put in here the ten micro cool and here the

126
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,320
thirty centimetres

127
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,440
you find three hundred thousand volts

128
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,990
you get three

129
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,900
i'm going to the difficult

130
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:32,490
if you take are equal sixty centimeters doublet

131
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,010
double the distance

132
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,500
potential goes down by a factor of two is one of or

133
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,950
there will be a hundred and fifty kilowatt

134
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,210
and if you go to three leaders

135
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,210
and it is ten times more

136
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,570
then in thirty can afford

137
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,960
so if you go to infinity

138
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,290
which for all practical purposes would be lobby seven

139
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,790
if you go to the lobby seven

140
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,990
then the potential

141
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,730
for all practical purposes

142
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,420
is about zero

143
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,560
because are so large

144
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,420
there's is no potential left

145
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,420
so if i

146
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,320
if i will tell you in march from infinity

147
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,620
to this

148
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,330
the surface of the then graph

149
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:26,080
and i put a charge q in my pocket

150
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,350
and i marched to defend the graph

151
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,210
by the time i reached that point

152
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,300
i have done work

153
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,710
i multiplied the charge now back to the potential that gives it work again because

154
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,170
potentials work unit charge

155
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,460
and so the work i have done

156
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,870
charted i have in my pocket

157
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,700
find the potential in this case the potential

158
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,220
of the then the graph

159
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,910
i all all the way to the surface which is three hundred thousand volts

160
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,500
if i were strongman output one cornwall in my pocket

161
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,330
that's a lot of charge

162
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,210
then i would have done three hundred thousand rules of work

163
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,800
i just carrying the one school or from lobby seven to defend the graph that's

164
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,730
about the same work i have to do to climb up the empire

165
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,380
state building

166
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,690
famous MGH my mass

167
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,330
times g times

168
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,080
the height have to climb

169
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,900
i know

170
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,230
how the

171
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,370
electric potential

172
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,830
goes was distances one of our relationship now i have arrived at the

173
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,330
then the graph i the surface with my test charge

174
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,340
and now i go inside

175
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,290
and irish slosh around inside i feel no force any more

176
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,630
there's no electric field inside

177
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:57,570
then this is a nice example of how detailed this vocabulary in psyches is

178
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,540
hall the relationship in

179
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:08,110
that something is inside something as hollow o

180
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,020
o instruction within the cyc

181
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:18,420
well this red objects is big and say well that's in the whole of this

182
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,040
is certainly one one possible understanding of the in this this is more than with

183
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,920
this so-called in a monk relationship

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,770
then they have different types of

185
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,630
that's a

186
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,440
this type of

187
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,920
inclusion would be een contained completely because the red object is

188
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,820
could contained completely in this

189
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,070
box are in contain partially in contain closed because

190
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,460
the object is closed or in contained opened because it can fall out of

191
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:03,020
then connectedtoinside sticksinto or screen screwedin and so these are all

192
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:09,020
this is basically the language hard to describe something his inside some some some something

193
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,230
something else

194
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,960
and business ontologies

195
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,880
our knowledge engineers from cycle using this language to describe

196
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,190
particular situation in the nature so for this one small as they are able to

197
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,500
describe mechanical device

198
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,190
he also with this kind of language but it can be used for anything else

199
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,050
here i just wanted to show the richness of this language an example of this

200
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,210
relationship in

201
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:44,480
and here is a character slides of one

202
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,590
more which i cannot show life

203
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,590
from site so

204
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,960
psychosis is one of the project one of the project in cyc is also taking

205
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,000
care or more than this

206
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,630
database of terrorism and other stuff

207
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,540
and what

208
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,460
what is

209
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,110
here is a front-end on the top of the site which is called

210
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,420
cyc analytic environment

211
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,190
there are basically we are able to to put

212
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,460
query the natural language

213
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:27,400
and ask cyc whether the claim is true or not or if whatever we are

214
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,710
interested in now

215
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,570
here's an example of very

216
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,440
and you can read this so the question is the following

217
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,500
who who has a motive for dissemination of what i could cutting

218
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,360
i think that it was labour prime minister visual skills i think two years ago

219
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,570
and it was not clear who killed

220
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,320
but there were

221
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,670
one of the assumptions that

222
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:02,130
some countries or organisations kind of sust and based on the knowledge which cycads insights

223
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,860
encoded from the public sources

224
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,520
the idea of these demos to show that i can

225
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,880
also come in

226
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,820
provide some answers and explain them is based on the open open information so basically

227
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,340
what we do here is

228
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,770
you type in

229
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,900
in the natural language so who had the motive force this notion of included and

230
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,460
question gets translated in the

231
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,540
first order

232
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:35,090
the query language is this is just

233
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:41,110
nicer form of this first order logic query nothing goes and you say OK

234
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,980
and then after a few seconds we get a list of questions list of answers

235
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:55,000
like this our science you k the united states are these are

236
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,040
possible suspects

237
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,950
if I say anything is rubbish plea please please interupt yeah I mean bayesians don't invent

238
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,040
methods bayesian bayesians build models the models toll

239
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,300
tell us what the method should be whereas frequentist

240
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,620
are happy to consider methods they dream of from anywhere

241
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,930
bayesian's inference is a place always conditional on the method we've got

242
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:24,660
it doesn't try anything about anything whereas in in frequentist frequentist world the cup

243
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,850
the emphasis is is on giving good answers in repeated use and so on and so on there's are some important

244
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,380
distinctions here and the two can be looked at in parallel

245
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,090
but you know there's not as if there's a competition between the two in which

246
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,300
one clearly wins

247
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,690
except perhaps as we come into the sort of the present day

248
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,470
it's just a few other issues are want to to emphasize

249
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,470
there was a time when I think it was difficult to be bayesian

250
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,160
if you had

251
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,950
clients so you know if you had

252
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,550
end users because there's a lot of needing to defend what you've done I think those days

253
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,470
are rather gone but

254
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,930
perhaps not completely one of the strenghts of bayesian inference is that we can go

255
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:13,670
directly and report the inferences we want we don't have to twist ourselves into logical

256
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:20,430
knots thinking about noel hypotheses and you know trying to express everything what's in

257
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,880
in what's often at least for the beginning students are very

258
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,620
counterintuitive way

259
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,950
a very key idea in bayesian inference is borrowing strength this idea that one

260
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,520
thing is always informative about another

261
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,170
you know everything connects if you measure something you'll you're learning not only about the

262
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,830
things that directly influence here but many other things as well and we'll will see that we'll

263
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:49,690
see that thing we will see that coming up in some of the examples

264
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,740
I think bayesian inference really pays off in complex and high-dimensional problems in in in

265
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,950
small-scale low dimensional problems to be honest we can have different philosophies about how we're gonna do it

266
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:05,980
but we end up with pretty much the same answers but as

267
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,950
problems get bigger and more complex than there are clear differences and bayesians I put it

268
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,950
to do more

269
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:18,260
but this one bit even even a committed bayesian will always defend

270
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:25,040
one aspect of the frequentist idea and that is that we happy typically fall to

271
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,160
use frequentist methods to evaluate performance

272
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:34,740
so the sort of frequentist consistency or frequentist performance of statistical of bayesian

273
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:40,000
statistical processes is a perfectly legitimate thing to think about

274
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:47,120
OK well that's the end of mine sort of opening a motivation trying to go over some of the

275
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,920
key ideas and this is the contents lists for the remainder of this of this

276
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,670
I've only arrived last night I never had a chance to meet any of you yet I

277
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,930
thr first thing I asked when I got to the bar was

278
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,090
you know what are the students like so I don't know anything about you individually but I know a

279
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:14,420
few things about you in general I know you're very bright I know that

280
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,540
you were very selected to get here

281
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:24,800
you beat the competition so congratulations but I also know you're pretty diverse in terms of where

282
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,500
you've come from and what you've done before so

283
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,660
that I say that by way of explaining that some of the things I'm gonna

284
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,540
talk about particularly today

285
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,380
will seem really really basic for some of you

286
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,810
but trust me I think it's I think they're worth doing and I suspect that some

287
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,170
of you

288
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,450
here who will appreciate

289
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,440
even the

290
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,050
the elementary things I talk about

291
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,920
let's talk a little about probability I'm not gonna say more about probability in this one

292
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,420
slide so if you don't know about probability you really are going to have

293
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,690
to go and look it up somewhere else

294
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,540
so probabilty is nothing but common sense reduced to calculus somebody said

295
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:13,970
I think just to recap it measures uncertainty on a zero one scale

296
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,470
zero and one mean what you think they mean

297
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,090
and there's really one property the probability has

298
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,050
and that is if you look at two events and if they can't both happen than the probability

299
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,970
of one or the other is the sum of the two probablities

300
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,070
this extraordinary but that's all you need pretty much that and the same thing generalized to accountable

301
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,760
collection of events

302
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,590
pretty much generates the whole theory of probability so this is remarkably light in terms

303
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,520
of axioms

304
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:51,310
and of course when we're dealing with data typically the we focus probability not on the general

305
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:56,210
theory of events but we talk particularly about random variables so almost all of the probabilty

306
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:02,470
we use will be talking up distributions of random variables discrete or continuous

307
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,640
scalar or vector or linear or all sorts of different bases

308
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,950
rendom variables and their their distributions

309
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,800
and there's only one thing we particularly need from probability theory and that of course

310
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,540
is Bayes theorem

311
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,690
you may

312
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:24,570
think that maybe that's where the word the name bayesian analysis comes from so here's

313
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,670
a really

314
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,970
small little problem I like puzzles and this this is a version of a puzzle

315
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,570
that appeared in a in a guardian newspaper recently

316
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:39,420
so these are little little games set in set in a sort of

317
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:43,120
fictitious context so you really you're now to draw two balls

318
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,570
you can't can't see inside the urns you you know the constitutions of the two but you don't know

319
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,970
which urn is which

320
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,040
and you really need a Red ball

321
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:57,200
OK and you you choose an urn at random and you pick out a ball and it's blue

322
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,700
OK and you only got one chance left

323
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,740
so the question we're we're asking is

324
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,430
so today we're going to spend a little bit of time on some elementary chemistry

325
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,850
just to develop our language that we use with one another and so when i

326
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:18,530
say hydrogen bond you don't stare blankly at me and structure heads

327
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,270
many of you have had this already for many of you this is a review

328
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,830
but it's a useful review we believe here at MIT of teaching things

329
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,950
two or three times often the same subject matter but increasing levels of sophistication so

330
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,190
i do this without a very metropolitan

331
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,500
our first issue here is how are atoms and molecules held together

332
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:47,140
and we are the most familiar way by which atoms and molecules are held together

333
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,340
is of course the covalent bonds

334
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,070
covalent bonds

335
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,230
a an energy of roughly eighty

336
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,140
kilo calories per mole

337
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:07,060
and that's a rather strong energy to hold together two atoms because

338
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,330
the the energy

339
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,130
the thermal energy

340
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,080
that is the energy it let's body temperature

341
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,730
it is about zero point six killer calories per mole

342
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:25,220
and therefore if you had a bond if there something holding things together that was

343
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,720
in this range are two or three or four five times higher

344
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,510
then the simple thermal energy at room temperature body temperature would be sufficient to break

345
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,860
apart such

346
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,910
but in fact

347
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,120
this energy the energy of covalent bonds so much higher

348
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:46,310
that it's highly unlikely the thermal energy

349
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,910
it's going to break apart a it's pre-existing covalent bond and i was just reading

350
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,140
yesterday how people were analyzing

351
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:58,100
the mitochondrial DNA from more manifold bones

352
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,650
which were dug up from the last neanderthal it around thirty thousand years ago or

353
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:08,010
or recently timized cousins and they were analysed DNA sequences and they got out of

354
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,860
those analyses stretches of DNA that were

355
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,510
two hundred three hundred nucleotides long

356
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,260
and and that really is stunning testimonial

357
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,090
to the fact that under very

358
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:25,010
difficult conditions nonetheless the less complex biochemical biological molecules are able to survive over astounding

359
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,560
periods of time

360
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,180
indeed those that are held together by the covalent bonds like this

361
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,020
of course you remember the the film jurassic park where they used

362
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,740
PCR reaction to resurrect the the DNA of dinosaurs that's a bit of a fantasy

363
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,890
since dinosaurs left us i guess about a hundred and fifty million years ago something

364
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,650
like that

365
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,300
there's a big difference between thirty thousand and one hundred fifty

366
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,150
a million years ago

367
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,800
now the fact is if you look at the way the molecules are actually hooked

368
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,500
for instance let's let's look at the water molecule here

369
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:06,750
ideally there should be no charge on this molecule in fact there is no net

370
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,810
but the the truth of the matter is if one wants to get frank the

371
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:17,540
oxygen molecule and we always are here the oxygen molecules have a greater affinity for

372
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:23,370
electrons than two hydrogen atoms i e there electronegative

373
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,220
and and therefore what this means

374
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,780
is it the swarms of electrons that are holding all this together the orbitals are

375
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:36,940
drawn more closely to the oxygen and the hydrogen atoms i e the protons are

376
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,630
relatively willing to give up

377
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,580
their electrons and what this means

378
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,790
is that there an unequal distribution

379
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,010
and as a consequence there is a fraction of the negative charge

380
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:54,820
here this and the molecule and the fractions of positive charges here because they it's

381
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,700
not as if they totally given up

382
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,830
the the electrons with electrons are shifted more in this direction and this molecule is

383
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,300
therefore called a polar molecule

384
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,510
by virtue of the fact that here has positive positive pole and here it has

385
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,630
a negative pole

386
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,660
there are other

387
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,280
pairs of molecules which are

388
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:20,080
relatively equal equally electronegative for example here we have the carbon and hydrogen these two

389
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,420
items are roughly equally matched in terms of their ability to pull electrons away one

390
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,840
from the other and as a consequence there is no net shifting of charge

391
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:33,290
and keep in mind that this delta i show here is only a fraction of

392
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,170
a an electronic charge is not the entire electronic charge moved over

393
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,520
this has important consequences for the entire biochemistry that were both about to get into

394
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,510
both today and on monday

395
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,390
important because polar molecules

396
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:55,610
such as water like this are able to dissolve certain compounds and non polar molecules

397
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,720
which can a large arrays of these kinds of bonds or carbon carbon bonds

398
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:07,940
these are relatively insoluble in water and that has important consequences for the organisation of

399
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,000
biological membranes

400
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,880
we might have a carbonyl one here that the see going to and all the

401
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,820
double bond and here we have once again the situation where the oxygen is far

402
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,530
more evident terms with

403
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,970
willingness and interest in pulling electrons toward itself and therefore the carbon gives up a

404
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:30,010
little bit of the electron cloud and it becomes slightly electoral positive

405
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,750
whereas the oxygen atom becomes slightly electronegative

406
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,580
and the fact of the matter is that there are also other bonds that are

407
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,450
noncovalent and are much

408
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:49,340
less energetic for example let's talk from what about hydrogen bond

409
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:56,670
and it's perhaps easiest to demonstrate hydrogen bond by looking at the structure of two

410
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,890
and the reason is i mean you have here convex function

411
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,400
the squared error and have a convex constraints so we can

412
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,620
jump back and forth from the primal to problem

413
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,190
OK so what does it mean is in this picture here so here on the

414
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,610
left hand side

415
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:18,090
you see in this picture this kind of l one regularisation l one world so

416
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,240
the contour lines or the residual sum of squares you're square loss and you try

417
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,230
to optimize got minimize that what you see here in the middle of the fifty

418
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:32,480
ordinary least squares estimator so this is for people to just two dimensions and now

419
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,110
you are saying the l one penalisation

420
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,600
you require

421
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:41,130
that the solution must be there the l one ball in the l one ball

422
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,030
is this a diamond here so the l one norm ball in two dimensions if

423
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:51,780
this region here so you require constraint solution to be in this region and that

424
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,440
what's happening here this example what you see is that data hot one

425
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:01,780
it is exactly zero because you hate the contour line at the age of your

426
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,290
and this is really

427
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:09,790
what i call one geometry of the problem its parts because the solution to this

428
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,350
in this constellation is forced to be zero and this have to do

429
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,890
because of the geometry of the of the

430
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,460
of the unit ball

431
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:26,320
now this is vastly different to l two regularisation this is called the ridge regression

432
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:32,220
sometimes is called taken kind of regularisation there constraint you're solution to live in DL

433
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:36,350
two ball and this is the standard ball and then it will never be sparse

434
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:40,610
you see from the picture i mean it never will happen that beta had one

435
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:45,370
is exactly zero because have very different geometry

436
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,380
so he was again what i said already about the o two world if you

437
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,120
do the regularisation still tool or

438
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,580
you can put in large multiplier for like this this is called the ridge regression

439
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:03,470
taken of regularisation and it's vastly different from the one norm regularisation because of the

440
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,830
different geometry

441
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:12,360
so what is actually the l one norm regularisation the loss of doing in the

442
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,600
simplest case the simplest case

443
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,580
is a linear model we ought to normal design so here's my linear models

444
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,750
and the design is or to normal

445
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,940
well you are maybe this is very artificial body packed it maybe not so if

446
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,240
you use for example of wavelet expansion on the regular grid you have an orthonormal

447
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:37,590
so in this case the loss of the one norm regularisation has an explicit solution

448
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,870
otherwise is just the comics optimisation problem but here it has an explicit solution

449
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,810
and the solution is

450
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:49,580
the famous soft thresholding estimator so what is it so

451
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,760
you can look at the ordinary least squares estimation

452
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,100
in this problem

453
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:58,400
and for the j th component is simply what i call vj

454
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,920
this is the least squares estimate

455
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,540
now the last so what doing is a bit

456
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:10,100
typically in this picture here so on the x axis we have disease the least

457
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:15,130
squares estimator and the y axis we have debate the beta house

458
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,280
now the last the solution may be hard to see is to find all the

459
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,270
blue line so whenever the ordinary least squares estimator is less than the threshold it

460
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,460
threshold lambda half the lasso zero

461
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,990
and if you do your risk register made an absolute value is bigger than lambda

462
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:36,110
have you move like this could this blue line here

463
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:42,290
in contrast the hard threshold estimator is the red dashed line it's OK if it's

464
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,190
listed lambda have zero

465
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,030
and if it's bigger inland have it's the ordinary least squares estimator so you just

466
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:52,890
truncate the ordinary least squares estimator and if it's kind of hard threshold function and

467
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,550
what you see a bit from this picture is that

468
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,250
the last so really has a bias problem

469
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:04,140
OK is the one norm regularisation even if the ordinary least squares estimate is huge

470
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,100
is very large and not absolute value if you're way out here way out there

471
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:13,940
if you would like to estimate just already first because it's unbiased but the loss

472
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:19,690
so never approaches the red line here so the last actually always inherit bias off

473
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,560
the order of land

474
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:26,160
and this is something which causes trouble so already in the simplest case even if

475
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,680
you're signal say for the j th component is huge is very large

476
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,280
you end up with the biosift of us

477
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,030
one can see from the picture

478
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:43,580
so let's just use the last so and then you want to understand a bit

479
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:49,580
more about some theoretical properties about it so how how do use the loss of

480
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:54,110
very simple the only thing what you need to do is to choose lambda cases

481
00:30:54,110 --> 00:31:00,300
regularisation parameter and what most people do including myself just rather the cross validation and

482
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,110
choose the best land which optimizes prediction

483
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,000
so in practice

484
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:10,180
you would choose what you can use some sort of BIC criterion as well most

485
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,610
people just choose lambda via cross validation

486
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,110
that's fine and then you can use again

487
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,510
some sort of cross validation to check overall how good you are this is kind

488
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,970
of what i've shown you at the very beginning and this is induced by the

489
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:29,570
international classification problem is not that important that you see really i mean the details

490
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:34,160
here i just want to tell you the last so that's pretty well just

491
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,250
take this

492
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,370
data just stick it into the linear model is not even the logistic model just

493
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:45,210
linear model to your classification just blindly and you end up with a pretty good

494
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:51,310
misclassification around saying pretty good in comparison to others it's still not very good classification

495
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:55,620
accuracy but that's in part due because the problem is very hard

496
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:01,450
so posting will be better than last year the forward selection algorithm a couple of

497
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:06,470
OK so this last week and prediction it can invalidate good yard at said that

498
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,860
already and you can also check

499
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,410
which variables are are choosing you know what's happening is if you do don't across

500
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:18,610
fully in a cross validation setting with every new fall cross validation

501
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,540
will pick a bit different variables so you see already here it's a bit stable

502
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,920
so depending on what actually what your data is you'll always have to be different

503
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:32,290
variables and average what's happening here in this example you pick about thirteen variables on

504
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:37,640
average out of more than seven thousand possible genes

505
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,450
OK so

506
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,390
what you can see just exploratory here

507
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,620
the last so yields very sparse model fit

508
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,750
just a doesn't variables out of the more than seven thousand variables

509
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,530
and i will try to explain to people what can we actually expect from from

510
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:58,010
result like this what are the thirteen variables are these now the real variables and

511
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,210
so on and so forth

512
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,870
OK so i built

513
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,700
bring couple minutes of more theory maybe full of you're more interested in theory never

514
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,570
moved back to methodology bring up in a bit of theory and so on the

515
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,220
OK so the easy part is prediction and estimation but it's actually in particularly estimation

516
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:24,270
will be important to say something more than about the future in variable selection problem

517
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,580
and the first OK here's the setting i just consider a linear models

518
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:36,370
theoreticians i assumed fixed design around design is slightly different but it's not a major

519
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:40,640
difference that look at the fixed design linear model and here is my true underlying

520
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,440
well remember what the weak learning assumption says is it says that

521
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,960
we're assuming that we can always do a a little bit better than random guessing

522
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,900
so what's

523
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:54,980
assume that all of the gamut he's are at least some positive number gamma

524
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,940
so in that case with this theorem is saying

525
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,720
is that the training area the final combined classifier

526
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:07,140
is that most e to the minus two times gamma square this constant gamma

527
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,640
times t where t is the number of rounds of boosting

528
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,800
so this is saying that

529
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:16,860
the training air is going down exponentially fast

530
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,160
as a function of the number of rounds of boosting the training areas dropping very

531
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,260
very quickly

532
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,980
is what this theorem is saying

533
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,950
even if gamma small as long as positive

534
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,280
the training you will go down very quickly

535
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,640
another point about this theorem

536
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:38,010
and about adaboost in general is that adaboost is an adaptive algorithm that's what he

537
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,920
had to stands for adaptive boosting

538
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:45,410
what does that mean that it's adaptive means that this algorithm does not need to

539
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:48,310
know the number of rounds of boosting ahead of time

540
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,800
and it does not need to know lower bound on the gamut years ahead of

541
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,290
either you can just

542
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:59,030
run the algorithm as it is and the bounds reflect

543
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,390
the fact that you might have a range of different chemicals using some of the

544
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,930
gamma are bigger

545
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,720
than others on some around you're doing better

546
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,580
then you're bound will be that much better

547
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:21,890
well you can

548
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,280
you can run the algorithm no matter what it

549
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,290
i mean you can run the algorithm

550
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,830
with with anything even if the gamut either zero this year will still hold

551
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,640
u u

552
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,900
if gamma t is are directly measurable is gamma t is

553
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,890
are just the air raid on the training set

554
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,390
so in that respect you can measure them

555
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,380
what's not so easy met to measure is

556
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:52,290
some the later stuffing and talk about where we're looking at the test theory

557
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,760
and there it's hard to tell what's what's going to happen on the test set

558
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:01,090
but certainly at this level you can measure the game is yes

559
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:16,140
so so really definition of we

560
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,330
he able to do

561
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,370
better than random guessing so let's say better than one half minus gamma for some

562
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,740
positive gamma

563
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,720
here i'm only using it slightly

564
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,150
weaker assumption which is that

565
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,910
on any distribution over the training set is you would do better than that

566
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,220
OK so the energy is zero

567
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,930
then all of these will be

568
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,370
zero and you to get to the

569
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:55,190
you don't want to discard trivial upper bound on the training area

570
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,130
and in fact the algorithm will do anything because alpha t will be zero and

571
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,680
nothing will happen

572
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,450
OK so

573
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,490
i thought i would

574
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,380
try to go through this proof just to show you how simple it is this

575
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,940
the one and only proof i have planned

576
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,210
so let me just try to

577
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,360
go through that had a high level

578
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,890
remember we have this weighted sum of the weak classifiers

579
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,860
and the final combine classifiers just the sign of that same weighted sum so let

580
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,700
me call that weighted sum of that

581
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,580
OK so that's just a tiny bit of notation

582
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,530
if you go back to the algorithm

583
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:42,970
you go back to this algorithm we've got this nice little recurrence between the distribution

584
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,490
and we can do is you can unravel

585
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:49,070
that recurrent

586
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,820
OK we can unravel that recurrent

587
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,570
and if you do that by the final i mean just the distribution after the

588
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,300
last round of boosting

589
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,590
if you unravel that we currently get an expression like this

590
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,110
and lo and behold

591
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,780
you have the same weighted sum up here

592
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,010
that we had over here and so the recurring i'm sorry the final distribution can

593
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,380
just be written in this

594
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,430
nice simple forms

595
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,780
just a tiny bit of rewriting using that recurrent

596
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,070
OK the second step

597
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:24,820
what we do is we can show that the training error

598
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,030
of the final combined classifiers

599
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:32,140
is at most the productivity is remember the these these normalisation constants

600
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,910
it would seem like just the way of making sure that the distribution

601
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,470
the new distribution would add up to one

602
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,630
divided by three i could have done by heart of course

603
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,970
this is o point one two

604
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,130
and amazing grace

605
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,530
only two percent of less than two percent

606
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,170
now here

607
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,040
o point

608
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,090
one eight six

609
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,540
times to divided by three

610
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,260
o point one two four

611
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,040
i can believe

612
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,930
less than one percent of

613
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,480
so you see in front of your eyes that we were able to create something

614
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,900
that was indeed extremely close

615
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:21,000
elastic collisions in spite of all the problems that we have a

616
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,510
and that of course there is always some loss

617
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,630
kinetic energy but it so little that it doesn't show up

618
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,790
in these

619
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,740
i want you to have

620
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,680
sleepless nights

621
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,970
i want you to think about the following

622
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,550
and if you can solve before the night is over

623
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,380
i really think

624
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:50,460
you should lie awake

625
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,460
here is the what

626
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:55,840
he was a tennis ball that comes in with a certain mass and

627
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,100
and it has a certain velocity v whatever that is

628
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,670
it's in nearly elastic collision and bounces back from the wall

629
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:06,080
and we all know that is a nearly elastic collision that it comes back with

630
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,270
the same velocity

631
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:13,640
kinetic energy is conserved all the kinetic energy is indefensible nothing is in the wall

632
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,370
the wall has an infinitely large mass

633
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,560
the momentum of this tennis ball has changed by an amount to envy

634
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:29,650
that momentum must be in the wall nonnegotiable because momentum must be conserved

635
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,970
so now you see in front of your eyes case that the wall has momentum

636
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,250
but it has no kinetic energy

637
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:37,140
can you

638
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:41,980
i understand that can you reconcile that can you show me mathematically that is completely

639
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,560
kosher that the wall

640
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,340
has momentum to MP

641
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,040
non-negotiable must-have moment

642
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:49,940
and yet

643
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,400
it has no kinetic energy how is that possible

644
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,500
think about it

645
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,940
and if you can solve it

646
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,290
call me three a m

647
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,920
and i'll tell you the solution

648
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,110
OK now let's look

649
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,580
this from

650
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,940
the centre of mass

651
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,430
frame of reference

652
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,390
the centre of mass is very special

653
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,230
and physicist love to work

654
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,940
the centre

655
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,330
of mass for reasons

656
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,220
that you will understand

657
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,090
in the absence of any net external forces

658
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,750
on the system as a whole

659
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,560
as we discussed last time the centre of mass

660
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,460
will always have the same velocity we did demonstration there

661
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,010
we still vibrating object with this spring

662
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:33,320
but yet the centre of mass was moving with constant velocity

663
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,970
the building now is if you jump into the frame of the centre of mass

664
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:40,280
that means you move with the same velocity of the centre of mass

665
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,680
the centre of mass standstill in your frame of reference

666
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,840
and if the centre of mass standstill still

667
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,210
the momentum

668
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,920
of the particles in your frame of reference in the centre of mass frame of

669
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,490
reference is zero

670
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,550
it is zero before the collisions

671
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,500
and it is zero after the collision

672
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,170
and this is the centre of mass some amazing properties

673
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,070
that i will discuss with you know

674
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,430
we have a particle

675
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,190
and one

676
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,400
and we have an article two

677
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,290
and this one

678
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,260
in the centre of mass frame

679
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,610
having velocity u one

680
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,820
and this is in the centre of mass frame

681
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:22,380
as a velocity u two i give it specifically use

682
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:28,020
so that you can separate useful face these always in your frame of reference use

683
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,630
the frame of reference of the centre of mass

684
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,220
and i take it case

685
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,230
by having completely elastic collisions means q

686
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,320
is zero the kind that we've just discussed

687
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,540
momentum is not only concerned but it is also zero

688
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,570
at all moments in time

689
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,520
before and after the collision

690
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,200
after the collision

691
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,190
let's say

692
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,300
goes back

693
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,000
with velocity

694
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,400
u two prime

695
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,980
and that's a one has a velocity

696
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,010
you want track

697
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,120
that's the situation after the collision

698
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,210
now i know that momentum is zero

699
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,810
so can i can here i i can write down

700
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:17,180
for the situation after the collision that and one

701
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,380
times you one prime

702
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,980
as and two

703
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:23,950
times due to prime must be zero

704
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:28,580
i don't write them down vectors that's not necessary because it's one one-dimensional collision

705
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,320
and the signs will automatically take care of the directions

706
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:38,280
i told you i chose the case of completely elastic collision q is zero

707
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,180
and so

708
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,990
kinetic energy must be

709
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,080
so i have before the collision

710
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,600
i have one

711
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,190
and one

712
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,640
u one square

713
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,260
as one half

714
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,670
and two

715
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,360
u two square

716
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,920
after the collision i have one half

717
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,980
and one

718
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,560
u one prime squared

719
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,070
was one have

720
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,170
u two times greater kinetic energy before

721
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,780
kinetic energy afterwards

722
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,990
CR one

723
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,300
the creation tool

724
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,400
can solve that cricket and we can

725
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,250
and the result is amazing

726
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,930
the result in the centre of mass

727
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,710
is that

728
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,230
u one prime

729
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,130
equals minus you one

730
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,580
and you two crime

731
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,210
equals minus u two

732
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,880
that is an amazing result when you think about it

733
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,590
it means that in the centre of mass

734
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:36,320
all that happens is that the speed reverse

735
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,480
directions but the speed the velocities reverse directions with speeds

736
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,310
the same

737
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,930
that is a remarkable

738
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:48,530
remarkable result

739
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,880
if you ever want to

740
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,290
move yourself to the centre of mass

741
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:54,430
you will have to know

742
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:57,210
what the centre of mass velocity is

743
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,820
how do we calculate the velocity of the centre of mass

744
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,090
so we did here

745
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,960
with the centre of mass frame

746
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,470
i'm going back to the

747
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:10,340
and we know that and total

748
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,840
times the position vector of the centre of mass we defined the last time

749
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,280
he called and one

750
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,780
time the position vector of a particle one

751
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,060
plus and two

752
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,710
position vector of a particle

753
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,800
and so

754
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:27,640
if you take the derivative of this equation

755
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,930
then the positions become velocities

756
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,230
so the velocity

757
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,880
of the centre of mass

758
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,400
equals one

759
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,090
divided by and one class and two

760
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,530
because that's the total which i bring on the here

761
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,820
and you compute these these

762
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,760
what is called a military or something like that where this is almost the same

763
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,440
matrix as

764
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:57,260
except that on the diagonal you have minus the sum of plus one on the

765
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,970
of the diagonal

766
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:02,650
so here you have one one you put to minus two here

767
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:06,380
here you have one one you put the minus two here the most interesting thing

768
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:12,570
is when you look at i x five you have one one one and you

769
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:15,260
put mine three here

770
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,710
and then you do the

771
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,260
exponential the matrix of h

772
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,120
this gives you matrix

773
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:27,500
of the same size of size five i five

774
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,260
and each entry of these five i five matrix

775
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,110
it gives you the kernel between

776
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,500
x i and x j k

777
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:42,420
and if you imagine that the your real graphs grows and there are many many

778
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,940
many points and etcetera you can make a connection between these

779
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,200
but you compute like that

780
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:57,330
and the gaussian kernel the usual gaussian kernel talk to you about

781
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,540
partial conclusions

782
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:06,090
and then i'll show you something on what's called the representer theorem amount of stuff

783
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:13,700
is that if you want to do kernels for structures become an idea is to

784
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:19,400
measure the similarity of objects through the similarities of their parts of their their structures

785
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:26,660
and lingering question is that the efficiency of the the kernel how how you can

786
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:31,000
you can compute its actions you can actually compute

787
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,670
and and and knowing that there is a trade between the efficiency and the and

788
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:42,280
how informative is the kernel

789
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:49,650
and there are many working solutions for graphs and sequences when i see working

790
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,790
especially for graph ice i mean that there are nice

791
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:58,160
algorithmic ways to two

792
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:05,210
tackle problems across i'm not very familiar with the literature on graph classification per se

793
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:11,860
so i want to say that it's is as as established as the literature for

794
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:14,380
sequence classification but

795
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,750
i know i think it's it's not that easy to use the graph kernels to

796
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:22,550
have very good results if you told me you tell me OK let's let's do

797
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:26,730
this this task and values are one of the kernels that i presented i'm not

798
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:32,760
sure that you can have a very good results from the start

799
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:39,590
so there are questions there many questions that says that the kernels for semi structured

800
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:44,650
data if you want to do is x XML data for instance you have

801
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:48,410
true structure and each node is labeled by

802
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:55,010
bye bye unstructured data like text or something like that and you have to deal

803
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:58,050
with different levels of structure and you have to

804
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,210
to work with that is not very easy to do that

805
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:07,120
and the idea of learning the kernel that as proposed by alun create for the

806
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:12,880
airport improved prediction problem is something that is very very

807
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:18,800
interesting and there are very many different algorithm that that are being developed on the

808
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,760
problem for all of the multiple kernel learning

809
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,790
OK guys were almost done

810
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:32,050
we're just going to two two to do this part of the representer theorems

811
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,330
and then i'll skip

812
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,790
the parts on the

813
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:40,870
the theory statistics statistical theory and you will if you want to do that at

814
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:48,000
with your friends are four for german people have plenty of time the sunday night

815
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:58,730
you can do that on the sunday nights i don't know

816
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:07,670
i myself have plenty of time since i've been here since two weeks or three

817
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:17,110
so the the question of interest so i'm going to talk to you about a

818
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:22,610
theorem that is very not very difficult to obtain but is and the rise of

819
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:26,660
a lot of results in kernel kernel methods and it's very

820
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:30,260
this is something that you have to to to work we then that you have

821
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,380
to have in mind when you work with kernels

822
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:38,730
so there is a common common features of a a common theme features feature when

823
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:39,950
you work with

824
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,080
kernels that you you see when you you do kernel ridge regression kernel fisher discriminant

825
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:52,320
SVM scanner perceptions current principal components component analysis is that you know

826
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:56,410
training training set s

827
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,860
labeled or unlabeled

828
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:03,950
then doing your stuff doing your own thing you end up with the function like

829
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,800
so this is why wouldn't call kernel expansion

830
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,610
important thing is that

831
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,760
is expressed in terms of kernel

832
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:21,030
evaluated on the training points

833
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,910
these extra eyes are those that are in the training points is very important

834
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:30,830
these were i want you to to see and this is what is very important

835
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,290
we're going to have to break

836
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:37,610
the magic on why this is so

837
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,280
why is

838
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:42,340
because the first thing you see that you may you may you may you may

839
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:47,080
wonder whether whether it's possible to have an x i prime which is not in

840
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,880
the training set

841
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,970
why would you be for this is really an exercise that is in the training

842
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:56,260
maybe you didn't want but

843
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,330
you might

844
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:04,240
there's a reason why the x eyes that appear here are precisely those that are

845
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,960
in the training set

846
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:12,200
and the reason why is explained by his theory

847
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:15,870
so the theorem states that

848
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:21,120
if you try to you have occurred

849
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:25,680
OK so i'm happy to take questions so so

850
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:28,990
no because i don't know exactly what you and what what you know what you

851
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:30,860
don't know if we stop me

852
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,860
if things are sounding mysterious

853
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,460
so i'm i'm i'm

854
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:39,080
i'm trying to stay with the essence of the idea what i try try to

855
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:48,320
stay away from from complicated pieces of mathematics but unfortunate means that only consider extremely

856
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,190
simple inference problem because they want to stay in the place where we don't have

857
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:57,070
to worry about how to compute the things they should be trivial to compute

858
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,340
but to tomorrow

859
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:02,110
you get some more

860
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,230
variations for your money is about what i'm trying to say is that it is

861
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:12,260
really clear what i'm saying what you really object it's not and even if

862
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:19,130
of course this is what this is what what's the the talks about right

863
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:24,010
OK so today so i'll talk a little bit about what is the motivation of

864
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,030
of of thinking about probabilistic models in machine learning why is that why is that

865
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,320
anything framework to do

866
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:32,780
two machine learning

867
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:37,050
and then i'll talk about this the distinction between the classical

868
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:42,230
we can share in and they

869
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,210
talk about how

870
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:51,320
you do inference in these models what happens when you have some data out there

871
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:53,220
change your view

872
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,490
view of the world

873
00:53:55,620 --> 00:54:00,600
i have the simple example and i again apologize for having the but extremely simple

874
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,600
example i think is the best way

875
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:05,980
of thinking about what the concept where are

876
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,580
and then

877
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,100
i talk about

878
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:15,400
one of the crucial aspect here is the what what i refer to as occam's

879
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,460
this sometimes something in this in the bayesian

880
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:26,020
in bayesian inference and it's something that sets based for apart from from the from

881
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,720
the simple form the classical in

882
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,220
talking little of model selection

883
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,280
talk about the topic which usually is not considered

884
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,820
very much in

885
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:37,880
machine learning

886
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,430
which relates testing

887
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,930
but you can test the hypothesis

888
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:45,620
and i want to talk about that because that really pinpoints a lot of a

889
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,270
lot of the crucial difference

890
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:54,000
now try summary well also i'll i'll go through a bunch of terms

891
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:58,620
and we try to define the residue precisely what these terms mean

892
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,050
and the reason i'm going to do that is that a lot of confusion over

893
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:04,060
or terminology and different

894
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:09,690
sub part of the community use different terms mean different things use the same terms

895
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:11,960
mean different things which is very unfortunate

896
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,230
people i have to live with

897
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,590
but i just like to point out the things that might be useful for you

898
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:21,820
in some of the next lecture by

899
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,610
very careful about

900
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:29,520
you know what meaning some terms have that really belong in in in talk but

901
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,910
i think it's very useful

902
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,450
later on but i would like

903
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:39,990
OK i also practically have a ten minute break about halfway through

904
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:43,880
so it was to be short enough that you

905
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,630
i don't have enough time to

906
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,620
it's not you know

907
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,900
all right so so let's let

908
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:58,790
but think about motivation so why why would you think about probabilistic models when you're

909
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,790
doing machine learning

910
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,520
there are quite a few reasons

911
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:08,400
the main one is the probability provides a language for representing uncertainty

912
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,910
and if you do machine learning and the idea is that you're not trying to

913
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:15,930
you don't have to have a set of rules that that the machine

914
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:20,610
knows about tries to find a rule that matches in a certain set of circumstances

915
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,180
rather show

916
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:27,300
the machine some examples and is supposed to extract somehow some regularity from from the

917
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:31,000
because you only showed a few examples and or the finite

918
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:35,470
amount of data because it is a great example can be

919
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,330
the noisy like some examples maybe not typical

920
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,170
of the relationship of the data

921
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,740
the the learning systems

922
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,740
can actually be absolutely sure

923
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:47,900
about things like can say well

924
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,610
but you seem to have the a character recognition system i've seen something that actually

925
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:55,820
looks a bit like this a couple of times and every time i saw it

926
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,510
i was told that this was two

927
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,370
probably this one is also to write but it's not

928
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:05,640
i can we be sure i only saw you ten of these things so system

929
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:08,830
depending on exactly how close they are depending on how

930
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,280
different things that were not to were

931
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:14,880
you know that this can be some some kind of paid out there and the

932
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:21,460
are are nice language to express this kind of work they OK and i'm ninety

933
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,890
percent of the two

934
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:26,810
that that means something very difficult

935
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:34,080
and again so that the the the the data that we observe can provide evidence

936
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:38,300
for and against different explanation but might have had two different

937
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:41,010
different hypotheses about what the world looks like

938
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:44,340
and then i gather some data and some of the data might favor one of

939
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:47,910
the happiest more than one and the ability to quantify

940
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,470
how much

941
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,710
this data it's evidence for and against these types of the nation's this seems to

942
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:57,380
be crucial element of something that's supposed to be learned

943
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:59,780
relationship from the like

944
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:04,220
one of the problems you

945
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:09,470
used for their they used to represent knowledge i can put probability distributions over things

946
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:12,890
like say well i measure the heights of people and they tend to be

947
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:18,340
you know one point seven meters minus o point two meters like that

948
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,720
a probability distribution over that thing will actually

949
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,420
and have to my knowledge about that

950
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:31,880
and also i i i can i can infer new states of knowledge so have

951
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,760
some knowledge and then i make new observation then i some of the my knowledge

952
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,290
i know that know how to be able to do that

953
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:45,090
i i need to be able to make optimal decisions so if i have

954
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:48,640
some knowledge about how i think the world works

955
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:51,560
and you have to make decisions based on the i i mean

956
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:57,160
is good for us so in connected to yesterday's lecture and that's again a little

957
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,620
bit more technical but it's only a few slides and I think it's nice to

958
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:07,600
see this so let me first state the theorem and I'll try to keep things as

959
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,930
simple as possible in particular from certain point of view one should actually do this and

960
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:18,080
not in terms of the standard VC-dimension but in terms of other complexity measures

961
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:23,060
that I haven't introduced so I'm not gonna do that here but the basic idea

962
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:30,600
you will also get like this okay so we consider hyperplanes for simplicity

963
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:37,180
we'll leave  out  offset where the W is in canonical form with respect

964
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:41,620
to a given set of points so again this was our canonical form here without

965
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:49,400
the offset plus B then the set of decision functions induced by these hyperplanes and defined

966
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:54,680
on this set of points and satisfying the additional constraint that the length of W

967
00:59:54,680 --> 01:00:01,480
is bounded by lambda from above this means that the margin is bounded from below

968
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,580
so the set of decision functions with large margins or margin bounded from below

969
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:13,720
has a VC-dimension which is bounded like this so it's bounded by this thing

970
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:19,640
bounding the length of the weight vector and also by their smallest sphere around the origin containing

971
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:26,020
the the set of data points so this is also a scaling issue and but the

972
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:32,340
main message here is that this VC-dimension can be can have a small upper

973
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:38,020
bound even in cases where we work in a high-dimensional or infinite dimensional space so

974
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:43,240
when principle remember from yesterday the VC-dimension always our upper bound from yesterday was

975
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:48,400
the number of parameters so it was the dimensionality of the space plus one

976
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,540
or in this case will be  dimensionality we don't have an offset so

977
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:57,040
we might have a very large upper bound trivial of bound VC-dimension which might

978
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:02,600
even be infinite this tells us  in reality it can be a lot smaller and

979
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:08,740
why is that the case well this is just to give you some intuition if you

980
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:16,640
have a situation where you here in this here you can still seperate these these

981
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:22,530
three points in two dimensions in all possible ways using separations of margin gamma

982
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:28,740
one but if we now require a larger margin of separation gamma two while still requiring

983
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:33,900
that the points all lie in a ball of certain radius around the origin then you

984
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:38,120
might no longer be able to seperate three points in all possible ways you might

985
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:42,640
only be able to do it for two points and if you require a yet larger

986
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:48,220
gamma allows a margin you might be able to do it at all

987
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:55,720
okay so the proof works as follows so we assume that we have a

988
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:00,600
set of point which is shattered by canonic hyperplanes with this constraint on the weight

989
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,670
vector shattered means we can all we can do all possible separations on these

990
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:12,040
sets of points which in view of the last slides means that for all possible

991
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:23,640
labels we can satisfy these equalities so remember from before that the positive points are

992
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:28,380
such that this quantity is larger than one and negative points are such that

993
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:34,400
this quantity is smaller than one we forget about the B and a compact way of

994
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,660
writing this is just to multiply with label and then both inequalities look the

995
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:45,440
same way so label times this function is always margin equal to one so

996
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:52,740
that means we have correctly classified the point XI YI so now let's assume we

997
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:58,020
can do this so whatever no matter what this set of labels is we

998
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:06,080
can find some hyperplane that has five C constraint and all these constraints so now we

999
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:12,740
will prove that  the more points so the larger R is the larger a certain

1000
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:18,520
quantity must be and in the second step we will relate this quantity to

1001
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:25,460
this radius and if we put the two things together we'll we will get our bound

1002
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:32,000
okay so the first step will simply consist of taking its inequalities and summing them over

1003
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:39,520
I so from I  equals one to R we will get this inequality here on the

1004
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:44,880
right-hand side there's not other one but R we then use the Cauchy-Schwarz  inequality so

1005
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:50,360
we upper bound this by the length of this vector and the length of this vector my

1006
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:56,920
assumption this is upper bounded by lambda so we now know that R is smaller

1007
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:03,680
than this smaller than this we divide by lambda we get this inequality here

1008
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,160
okay that's the first  step of the proof second one is a little bit trickier but also

1009
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:14,700
not really difficult so things always look easy in retrospect but this also took a while

1010
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:19,200
for people to have this nice elegant proof this one is due to Gurvits in

1011
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:25,180
this second part we'll use a probabilistic methods we use so-called Rademacher variables these are

1012
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:32,980
independent random variables values plus minus one equally likely plus minus one so in

1013
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:39,940
that case we look at the expectation of this quantity here so so far we are

1014
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:47,660
allowed to we haven't fixed what other Y values yet so let's look at this quantity here

1015
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:53,880
first of all we can take we can rewrite this thing here like this and

1016
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,940
we can take one of the sums so this is like some over I times sum

1017
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:04,280
over J with these thing we move one of the sums are the expectation is linear

1018
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:09,320
to get this quantity now we split this second sum into two parts one is

1019
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:14,160
the part well this so by construction these I mean if these were not

1020
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,620
independent then we would have a problem that's right but we are allowed to assume them

1021
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:23,020
independent it's just a calculation when we say let's consider independent randomly we are allowed to

1022
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:28,990
make this assumption we will later fix into some specific value but for now to

1023
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:34,420
prove this we're allowed to assume they're independent because I mean the shattering we're assuming that this

1024
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:39,560
is  this way find such a hyperplane that shatters the data which means that we

1025
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:48,940
can solve this problem no matter what the labels are okay so now we

1026
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:55,660
additionally we additionally know that by assumption all points are contained in this ball of radius R

1027
01:05:55,660 --> 01:06:01,760
so we use this as well and therefore remember look at the last slide again this

1028
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:11,700
quantity is upper bounded by  R times this upper bound on this which is this quantity

1029
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:15,900
now this is a statement that holds for the expectation over this random choices of

1030
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,880
algorithm for linear programming you have to

1031
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:26,600
twist the simplex method to make it polynomial but you can do so there is

1032
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:32,620
a polynomial algorithm but most people happy with the simplex method which is polynomial in

1033
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,500
all practical cases

1034
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:42,150
so this is this is polynomial actually this is polynomial to it and getting arbitrary

1035
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:46,900
you getting within a given epsilon in polynomial time at the time of mention the

1036
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:53,250
name of the guy who I've got a car market

1037
01:06:53,560 --> 01:07:03,720
as opposed to the throughout

1038
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:07,980
bombshell into this well established theory

1039
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:12,330
so by discovering methods that

1040
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:16,870
that he 440 claimed high high efficiency

1041
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:24,760
families in his presentation of his new methods it was being the simplex method by

1042
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:31,440
which I mean there is a serious revolution important scientific subject because this is these

1043
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:38,540
calculations are done a lot of them well much more of course that led to

1044
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:45,120
many discussions as much as much further work to understand the theory behind it and

1045
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,980
now uh I think probably in reality most people

1046
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,940
most codes would just quickly use the simplex method but the interior methods were definitely

1047
01:07:58,130 --> 01:07:59,650
that has always

1048
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:04,040
this'll be better in some problems this will be better another problem

1049
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:06,150
this is

1050
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:10,000
I done everything except explained

1051
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,420
the simplex method

1052
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:19,020
I have and I haven't haven't explained this interior point sort of there's a penalty

1053
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:21,770
anyway is a penalty is you get near the

1054
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:27,440
border so you see it stops you short and then you look again I could

1055
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,820
try to explain that simplex method since we've got to this point in a few

1056
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:38,740
minutes but still cannot take a few minutes to to describe how the simplex method

1057
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:44,540
and I haven't done duality I haven't looked at the and this is what I

1058
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:47,820
wanted to have a lot of the dual problem

1059
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:53,250
so what's the dual problem in this particular case b

1060
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:55,500
is just the number

1061
01:08:57,690 --> 01:09:00,800
there is only 1 y

1062
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:07,480
and what's the constraint in the dual problem a transpose wireless recall seeing a wall

1063
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,130
was 1 1 2

1064
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:16,360
so that's not transpose 1 1 2 1 1 2

1065
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:18,270
multiplying y

1066
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:25,130
is less than equal to whatever the cost 5 3 and 8

1067
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:28,000
yeah I'd rather tell you about the dual problem

1068
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,270
so that says what

1069
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:39,250
let's recall 5 wireless recalls 3

1070
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:40,790
to wireless recall

1071
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
and what's the biggest what you could tell me the answer

1072
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,300
we could solve the dual problem

1073
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:51,020
I wanna maximize for what

1074
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:57,820
where Y has 3 littoral 5 also was recalls 3 and 2 1 3 weight

1075
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,980
so what's the smallest 1

1076
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:08,160
the largest why has largest was possible

1077
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:14,960
there's nobody but the wire to solve all 3 of these conditions the street right

1078
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:20,440
why have 3 layers review 5 the why has the lowest essentially I achieved was

1079
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:24,100
computer compare competing with a PhD for the mother

1080
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
but he must also compete with a grad student for the money and the grad

1081
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:34,520
because it's cheaper has gone out of the tutor has reduces right because he has

1082
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,210
to be

1083
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:40,690
the resistive and he has also be what the computer charge so this

1084
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:47,100
fail alarming use that word is is and say solve the problems for you

1085
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:54,400
if you solve for problems

1086
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,400
anyone societies rate as high as they can

1087
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,580
but he can't set the rate above what

1088
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,300
is competing with

1089
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,420
and he's competing among other things with the

1090
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,130
so that you can't set his rate per problem

1091
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,180
he charges the rate per problem not per hour has just look the answers only

1092
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:18,360
takes into sex

1093
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,820
per problem

1094
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:24,960
he has to

1095
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:32,710
that that has to be match like like auto sales he has to match

1096
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:40,170
what the other guys world and the other guys will will solve so many this

1097
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:49,170
it's the computer solves the problem solved charges 4 dollars a problem right

1098
01:11:49,190 --> 01:11:54,310
because computer charges 8 dollars an hour but solve 2 problems so the computer is

1099
01:11:54,310 --> 01:12:00,650
released solving charging 4 dollars a problem so that Jeter can't charge more than 4

1100
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:04,500
but the grad student is only trading 3 dollars a problem so what's the minimum

1101
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,940
and the maximum here what's the what's the White Star

1102
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:16,810
the wise story is how much can the cheetah charge of phrase that maximizes why

1103
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:19,670
posturing and this is the tight constraints

1104
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:25,720
and the maximum is 12 and that's what of course

1105
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:26,670
the grad student

1106
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:30,640
charge the charge

1107
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,000
iterative get students hours

1108
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,760
where I took the cheetah 4 seconds

1109
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:43,270
but the to do that the cost was the same so that this was 12

1110
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:44,290
equal crops

1111
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:56,980
and we could even see that was optimal you see why it's optimal weight which

1112
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:01,170
of these inequalities why

1113
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,020
this stage

1114
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,210
lax pair

1115
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:08,770
the difference between e and here is a little bit less clear as you say

1116
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:12,830
then what you're actually doing is sort of the show shoving your time by for

1117
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,750
little bit i look away while you try that back in the audience

1118
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:17,960
you don't feel uncomfortable

1119
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:22,380
we have the notion of our reduction

1120
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:28,060
in an unstressed syllable often have reduced vowels

1121
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:35,620
and in english we have at least three of those dipthongs are generally transition in

1122
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:40,270
transitional kind of things are usually a combination of of

1123
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:47,500
static files for example the the i sound in bite is actually a combination of

1124
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:50,670
transition of the eye and the evils

1125
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:52,770
OK rushing through here

1126
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:25,870
no that's that's a static volume the eight

1127
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:28,210
just the

1128
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:31,270
yeah well

1129
01:14:31,290 --> 01:14:37,270
oh no you're right that matches a stroke OK you got me

1130
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:38,210
good job

1131
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:47,140
anybody else what they that's true that you got me that is actually

1132
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:49,580
the other

1133
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:53,900
and wilkinson i'm zipping through here because i'm really just trying to define terminology but

1134
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:56,980
stop me if i if i go to far

1135
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:03,750
consonants these are all non sila in other words there are there

1136
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:08,060
it is some sort of obstruction the vocal tract and the

1137
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:11,370
we basically can distinguish consonants by

1138
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:18,400
the distinctive features associated with the place of articulation the and also a manner of

1139
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,500
articulation for staff

1140
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:25,380
constant is a complete stoppage of airflow in the vocal tract followed by a release

1141
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:32,100
there is noise from constriction in the vocal tract and four nasals in general the

1142
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,500
valve is open and air is flowing through the nasal cavity

1143
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,100
so i am an

1144
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:45,730
skip this i'm going to have i think i'm taking a little bit too much

1145
01:15:46,770 --> 01:15:48,640
this particular topic

1146
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,190
so how how would we apply

1147
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:57,520
distinctive features all i think

1148
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:01,330
one of the way you see them applied most is in

1149
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,540
among of foreknowledge is

1150
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:09,210
is we can basically use them to define phonological rules

1151
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:13,040
describing morphologically related words

1152
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:16,400
so the most common example you see

1153
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:23,830
four should given to describe this

1154
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:26,210
this procedure

1155
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:33,620
is pluralisation of english nouns OK in general orthographic orthographically in english we will paralyze

1156
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:34,870
mounds by

1157
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,920
adding an answering yes and but for me musically

1158
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:44,940
plurals result in adding one of three different kinds of endings as

1159
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,230
fuzzy sound or the is sound

1160
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:53,230
and the actual ending really depends on the last phoneme of the word

1161
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:01,730
so the question is then if i have here i have some examples

1162
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:03,150
of of

1163
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:07,120
a different set of words got three groups of words and the question is

1164
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,170
what is the minimum feature set

1165
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:16,400
i would describe the phonemes that proceed these different vowel endings so for example

1166
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:20,670
the first step towards breeze fleece

1167
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:28,270
a i want in english the

1168
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:31,670
the actual ending would choose here is the

1169
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:35,500
there is the the third of the possible plural endings

1170
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,520
and so on and so forth

1171
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:46,230
the way i can describe the rule for which of these endings values itself

1172
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:50,830
is all specify the distinctive features associated with the

1173
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:57,060
last phoneme in these words and so for any lexical item then that i can

1174
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:02,150
describe with these distinctive features i could tell you that i'm going to use this

1175
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:03,560
type of

1176
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:08,100
plural ending right and so that i could do the same thing with the next

1177
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,250
set of words from up a lot

1178
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:12,750
park leaf and moss well

1179
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:18,440
for all those values the s plural ending and i could say in general that

1180
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:27,730
that the consonantal and vocalic invoice distinctive features are what will describe all you know

1181
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:32,600
for every word out that will describe the last phoneme in the word that for

1182
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:37,420
all those words that would correspond to an as for landing and the last group

1183
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:41,770
all of these and in all the last

1184
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:46,850
phone for all of these words in the last group of our vote basically voiced

1185
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:52,670
and so for all voiced words we would have our nouns anyway all nouns with

1186
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:53,880
the last

1187
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:58,330
phoneme being voiced we would use the plural endings so this gives me a lot

1188
01:18:58,330 --> 01:18:58,540
of the

1189
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:06,270
you know i illustrates some of the advantage of using a distinctive features i can

1190
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:08,880
so basically i consider factor

1191
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,670
the distinctive features of service of factor representations so i i don't have to know

1192
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:16,770
for each

1193
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:19,600
each item lexicon what the

1194
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:26,500
the plural ending in this example will be i can just if i can specify

1195
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,870
the distinctive features associated with that last phone i could tell you what that's going

1196
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:31,600
to be

1197
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:32,480
and so

1198
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:37,790
lots and lots of examples like this and in general that's what that's what distinctive

1199
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:43,600
features are used for by foreknowledge in were released one thing in sort of describing

1200
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,330
morphologically related words

1201
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:49,080
right i mentioned before

1202
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,040
the notion of

1203
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:57,500
a phoneme is really linguistic quality to map from linguistic quality too

1204
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,540
the two acoustic acoustics we use the we generally prefer to

1205
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:08,150
and of

1206
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:29,900
and there are few

1207
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:39,990
o o

1208
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:58,570
but you know

1209
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:21,850
well the rest of his

1210
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:33,500
and it's very easy

1211
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:40,380
show it was all about

1212
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:04,970
or a

1213
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,990
one year

1214
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:23,250
great is the

1215
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,650
this one the

1216
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:10,570
this whole

1217
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:18,530
it is

1218
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:21,840
well it and

1219
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:46,410
well to be here

1220
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:54,320
it is

1221
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,470
it there

1222
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,810
particle number two

1223
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:59,340
get minus

1224
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:01,840
because crowded times a two

1225
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:03,220
and a little boring

1226
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:09,670
why omega riskrand

1227
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,840
however y here

1228
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:15,300
so i get an h three

1229
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:17,350
which happens to be zero

1230
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:19,190
that's not so relevant

1231
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:20,070
right now

1232
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:21,960
and then i get plus

1233
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:24,850
a one

1234
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:29,080
and the reason why i started off with one and two told now you see

1235
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:30,320
we can put

1236
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,670
in the east part

1237
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,690
the piece particle now

1238
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:39,500
it's going to be rather easy maybe i forgot the color

1239
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,450
omega is created

1240
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,700
a b

1241
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,530
omega zero credit

1242
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,300
lines omega zero credit

1243
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:56,100
now we're going to get

1244
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,190
people as well

1245
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:05,200
by one

1246
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:07,500
o zero

1247
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:08,770
also this

1248
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,450
because there are also this

1249
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:13,930
well sarah

1250
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:15,530
so now you see

1251
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,270
the differential equation

1252
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:18,990
particle number p

1253
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:21,680
so you can go on no

1254
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:24,510
part of the capital and now you have to solve

1255
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,890
and differential equation

1256
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:29,460
that's so

1257
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,420
it's a terrible thing

1258
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,610
we will take a shortcut

1259
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:40,100
which is not very rigid

1260
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:43,730
but it really will save a lot of mass

1261
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:46,820
and that we will use our intuition

1262
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:48,190
something that we know

1263
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,270
sort of

1264
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,950
from experience

1265
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,840
if you have a lot of on

1266
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:57,890
fixed and fixed here

1267
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:02,760
you ask yourself what's going to happen in the lowest possible model

1268
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:08,020
you just know that you get something like this

1269
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:11,310
this is like

1270
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:14,830
and you know that in this second

1271
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:19,060
normal mode the one that follows is has a higher frequency

1272
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,270
you expect that this site goes up

1273
01:26:22,330 --> 01:26:24,210
this goes down

1274
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:27,480
there also made like this

1275
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,580
so we use that experience not very rigid

1276
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:31,740
in order to

1277
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:33,480
the site on

1278
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,610
our trial function

1279
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:39,090
this would be

1280
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:41,640
mode one

1281
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:43,110
this would be

1282
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:48,580
well log on this would be to

1283
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,950
so now i'm going to put it

1284
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:52,600
as a trial

1285
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,560
eighty four particle p

1286
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:05,810
which is in involved and nancy this is vote

1287
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,870
i want a sinusoid in there

1288
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:14,490
that is always zero here and zero there

1289
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,130
and you can have an amplitude of course i can freely choose so

1290
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:19,270
c of and

1291
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:22,190
is the amplitude of the sinusoid

1292
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:24,980
c one

1293
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:28,230
this value is going to be seen to each one

1294
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:30,770
have it's own amplitude

1295
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:33,530
and then i get the sign

1296
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:35,200
one of the

1297
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:40,010
over and was one

1298
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,740
let's look together at this

1299
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,760
equation so that we have a full understanding

1300
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:49,800
we are trying to put in there

1301
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:53,940
equals zero

1302
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:57,210
that the site is always

1303
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:02,800
it's obvious because we want to that because this point

1304
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,200
the zero point

1305
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:05,870
not moving

1306
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:09,680
notice also that if you put in equals and as well

1307
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:13,530
and on

1308
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:15,920
also always zero

1309
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,990
forty b and was one

1310
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:19,890
sign of multiple

1311
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:21,400
i'm by is always

1312
01:28:21,410 --> 01:28:22,930
zero because

1313
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:24,480
now our model

1314
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:28,460
three seven

1315
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,250
that we are

1316
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:33,580
looking for

1317
01:28:33,630 --> 01:28:42,640
for instance if we take n equals one

1318
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,300
let's take an equals one so we

1319
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:45,890
i have

1320
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,620
and they all in mode one

1321
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,780
then we get a

1322
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,050
the vote

1323
01:28:55,130 --> 01:29:00,020
c one which is the amplitude of the sinusoid

1324
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:02,790
and then you would have to sign

1325
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:04,240
of and i

1326
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,220
this one

1327
01:29:09,130 --> 01:29:09,900
and you can

1328
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,760
convince yourself that that is exactly

1329
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:14,270
this sinusoids

1330
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,590
with amplitude c one

1331
01:29:16,670 --> 01:29:18,890
and you can also convince yourself

1332
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:22,890
it is zero

1333
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:25,020
article and this one

1334
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:28,510
it's again zero of course and if you take an equal two

1335
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:31,460
so they need

1336
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:38,840
you and is the right

1337
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:39,970
thank you very much

1338
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:42,380
that what you're saying

1339
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,700
but you're was

1340
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,580
thank you very much

1341
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:47,690
is not quite a

1342
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,650
that is the p

1343
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:53,650
so for particle number and p zero you see this goes to zero and the

1344
01:29:53,650 --> 01:29:58,160
bees and this one is to get close to zero

1345
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:00,220
so you see here the AP

1346
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:04,200
yes no c two

1347
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,010
after being

1348
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:09,680
by by by and this one

1349
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:13,740
and that's exactly is this curve

1350
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:16,980
notice that if you put in equal zero you get a zero

1351
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:20,480
if you put in the capital and was one you get a zero

1352
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:23,890
but you will also find that was zero precisely in the middle

1353
01:30:23,930 --> 01:30:24,990
when p

1354
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:26,710
its capital and was one

1355
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:30,040
divided by two

1356
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:31,950
so that's the consequence

1357
01:30:35,810 --> 01:30:38,560
of this function

1358
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:39,720
and of course

1359
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,050
the ratios

1360
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:43,480
all of the individual piece

1361
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,240
for a particular mode

1362
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:46,860
take for instance

1363
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:49,040
well number one when the

1364
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:52,300
the system is also like this

1365
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:54,150
the ratios of the

1366
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:58,560
and the church of the individual pages is that i

1367
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,090
this site

1368
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,280
has its own and two

1369
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:04,060
two has its own two

1370
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,200
three has its own and two

1371
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,940
one year

1372
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:12,990
two will be there three will be there before we be there and saw

1373
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:16,110
so the amplitude first goes up and the amplitude

1374
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:19,310
goes down again

1375
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:22,070
now comes the question what is omega and

1376
01:31:22,130 --> 01:31:23,470
what is the

1377
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:25,990
frequency omega

1378
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:28,060
at these

1379
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:32,770
normal motives and equals one n equals two articles three and four and cannot go

1380
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:33,910
all the way down

1381
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:38,840
and for that

1382
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:41,070
we have to return

1383
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:46,230
two this equation

1384
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:51,010
right now slightly differently

1385
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,890
i'm going to take the

1386
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:55,150
eight to one side

1387
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:58,120
i'm going to write down a

1388
01:31:58,150 --> 01:31:59,390
first one

1389
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,660
the or

1390
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:01,350
they don't

1391
01:32:03,230 --> 01:32:03,940
but the

1392
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:06,410
the next thing which

1393
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:12,730
i mean that i don't know

1394
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:15,330
many of you

1395
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:17,460
i have my vote

1396
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:18,290
we can

1397
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:48,600
i mean

1398
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,600
i was

1399
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:09,640
you know

1400
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:16,660
the image

1401
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:36,040
but the best way to go

1402
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:42,560
what we have

1403
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:48,460
and with

1404
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:54,710
one to all of the big picture

1405
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:59,930
one of the players

1406
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:01,120
but becomes

1407
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:08,870
it can only make

1408
01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:17,500
so you have by the way

1409
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:26,830
was in

1410
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:52,890
why this

1411
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:27,480
and the last one is

1412
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:34,790
but somehow

1413
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:36,750
for them

1414
01:35:40,810 --> 01:35:44,600
and the whole to your

1415
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:49,730
sometimes to bring one up

1416
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:52,830
the band

1417
01:35:55,410 --> 01:36:04,250
we want to that is the which you want to be

1418
01:36:04,330 --> 01:36:06,790
one two

1419
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:09,910
which he was to

1420
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:11,600
by one mission

1421
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:21,370
you can

1422
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:27,710
one of the most efficient

1423
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:33,290
just like

1424
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:35,140
the one

1425
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:44,460
but that

1426
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:51,680
the clothes

1427
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:00,250
so just because like

1428
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:12,790
so you can

1429
01:37:12,810 --> 01:37:18,460
no one in which the player

1430
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,350
and that these

1431
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:32,640
quite a

1432
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:42,460
problem but we can

1433
01:37:51,370 --> 01:37:53,660
which shall

1434
01:37:53,710 --> 01:37:56,730
it is the biggest one the

1435
01:37:56,750 --> 01:38:00,660
and just to

1436
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:05,100
by the one

1437
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:08,460
more generally

1438
01:38:11,370 --> 01:38:14,850
it this is just like

1439
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:25,850
you may not quite

1440
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:32,330
it is also

1441
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,210
a lot

1442
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:47,440
and the idea is for k to simply for being directly going to address in

1443
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:52,670
memory and store the information in the data can just pick it up

1444
01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:53,730
so no

1445
01:38:54,770 --> 01:39:01,730
this linear operators constant cost going into memory and retrieve them the information for the

1446
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:07,520
so look up and up the update operation o one

1447
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:11,610
one of the interesting it's true

1448
01:39:11,630 --> 01:39:16,210
compute when f of x i all examples

1449
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:17,730
this takes

1450
01:39:19,150 --> 01:39:23,980
both of the data structure and i look in the data structure

1451
01:39:24,130 --> 01:39:27,040
if you say a the number of

1452
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:30,130
l is the number of the length of the sequence

1453
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:32,840
OK this is the case the length of the camera

1454
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:36,980
but this is not the time needed to build up the data structure

1455
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:38,980
because we can have at most

1456
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:42,770
u k different came in the training set

1457
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:44,750
size q

1458
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,020
and these are the

1459
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:52,040
lookup operation so we can at most n and l k became which look

1460
01:39:53,210 --> 01:39:58,250
so if you don't have the data structure then we a a few

1461
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:03,020
you one or and even more so by the point

1462
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:08,630
so this is a very efficient but only only for small k

1463
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:12,860
april nucleotides you can work till maybe order

1464
01:40:14,210 --> 01:40:15,880
what may be ordered ten

1465
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:20,360
but not much

1466
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:23,730
another approach is the sorted list approach

1467
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:31,270
it's essentially the approach that i talked about before the spectrum so we

1468
01:40:31,270 --> 01:40:36,590
i have a list of came just put

1469
01:40:36,610 --> 01:40:39,650
and became a number

1470
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:41,210
and then we sort that this

1471
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:42,900
according to the payment

1472
01:40:42,980 --> 01:40:45,310
whenever we have to look into this

1473
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:50,090
we have another list came and we can go down both this thing time

1474
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:55,110
can see which which elements are

1475
01:40:55,110 --> 01:41:00,110
then we can take them you know which number

1476
01:41:00,190 --> 01:41:02,650
but what we need is we need to support the

1477
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:05,980
that's why the

1478
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,130
variation of this this is a bit like you look you

1479
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:17,190
it need much less memory and also works for large because we don't need to

1480
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:22,670
as much memory or more explicitly

1481
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:27,290
get lost

1482
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:30,460
this is an example of tree

1483
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:38,130
this would be particularly automated degree kernel the idea is that

1484
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:41,790
you store tree all the way

1485
01:41:41,810 --> 01:41:43,540
point is that the article

1486
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:45,520
for example

1487
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:52,630
a a b a b a b b example edit with you

1488
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:54,290
a a a

1489
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:55,920
eighty eight

1490
01:41:58,040 --> 01:41:58,840
you see

1491
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:04,650
in these nodes because store information and the store like the information which

1492
01:42:04,670 --> 01:42:06,830
examples have been added work

1493
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:11,110
which are much greater and much of the debate has been added to the knowledge

1494
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:17,440
and then we can later look in the trees and two additional

1495
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:24,230
get i love

1496
01:42:24,670 --> 01:42:30,230
i guess i'm going to believe it

1497
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:32,130
we can use this

1498
01:42:32,130 --> 01:42:37,830
i'm happy to be here again for the second lectures devoted to nuclear physics

1499
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:45,030
last time i was talking about some features about the nucleus

1500
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:51,860
so i presented the discovery by the front experiment properties of right use

1501
01:42:51,870 --> 01:42:53,370
binding energy

1502
01:42:53,390 --> 01:42:59,000
the nucleon nucleon interaction lifetime then i finish with some applications

1503
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:02,320
for medical applications are energy

1504
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:05,040
are art archaeology

1505
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:06,600
so then today

1506
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:09,290
is devoted to the modeling of the nucleus

1507
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:12,500
so i will present two types of approaches

1508
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:18,250
macroscopic approaches so then we describe the nucleus in terms of fluids

1509
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:20,900
you will see that it's like a liquid drop

1510
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:24,500
and then i will present to microscopic approaches

1511
01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:26,060
so the difference is

1512
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:29,430
you know that you will reiterate the nucleons

1513
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,750
and the interaction between them

1514
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:35,890
so these are associated with and mean field approaches

1515
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:41,940
because the last week i just remind you some features important for today

1516
01:43:41,970 --> 01:43:47,220
so i remain notation so the proton is made of protons sorry a nucleus is

1517
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:51,250
made of protons and neutrons and we introduce the smartest member

1518
01:43:51,970 --> 01:43:54,640
which is the sum of neutral plus

1519
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:58,770
we define it is by adamic numbers e

1520
01:43:58,780 --> 01:44:03,270
one consensus it's around ten minus forty meter

1521
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:07,520
more precisely you have these experiments

1522
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:14,720
result concerning right is here in film depending on the web so a entries e

1523
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:20,630
and you see that for all these nuclei i between commonplace to lead to hate

1524
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:21,940
you have these

1525
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:24,780
straight line almost straight line

1526
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:28,970
so you have these little air because one point twenty five

1527
01:44:28,990 --> 01:44:31,080
that's a one third

1528
01:44:31,910 --> 01:44:33,050
when does it

1529
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:37,720
it means that you have the right use which increases with a one third

1530
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:41,630
and the volume increases with the number of particles

1531
01:44:41,650 --> 01:44:43,750
just remember that for

1532
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:46,570
the liquid drop model

1533
01:44:46,570 --> 01:44:52,530
concerning the nucleon interaction for free nucleon you have these interactions with you like that

1534
01:44:52,530 --> 01:44:56,030
which is very intense and official french

1535
01:44:56,040 --> 01:45:00,500
so it is attracting here and you have here is a hard core

1536
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:05,500
what is also important for today that you have the proton neutron interaction which is

1537
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:09,700
bigger neutron neutron and proton proton interaction

1538
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:16,200
also because of the charged protons you have coulomb repulsion between them

1539
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:22,200
last time we have defined many types of nuclear insisted one hand and the unstable

1540
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:29,000
so far stable so it means that their lifetime is infinite so that's why them

1541
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:33,910
is lower than the mass of them of their component

1542
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:38,680
so we define the as given the case like the mass of the components and

1543
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:43,570
times the mass of the neutrons is it terms of protect minors this quantity which

1544
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:45,440
is the binding energy

1545
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:49,950
so first of all can you have to be positive and for unstable

1546
01:45:49,970 --> 01:45:53,040
you have this exponential decay here

1547
01:45:53,070 --> 01:45:55,250
so during the first course today

1548
01:45:55,260 --> 01:46:01,060
then the lecturer introduce this exponential decay

1549
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:05,150
so this is the way we determine life

1550
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:08,600
so there are different types of radioactivity

1551
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:14,130
and finally share neutron proton emission from the weak interaction you have

1552
01:46:14,150 --> 01:46:19,310
the the miners and the topless DJ electron capture

1553
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:27,350
these are all the nuclei that are predicted to more than five

1554
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:32,090
doesn't make clear that are predicted to exist and have not been discovered

1555
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:35,760
on earth there are two hundred ninety one here

1556
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:40,660
and more than two thousand have been sent to sites in

1557
01:46:40,690 --> 01:46:44,910
different levels factories like here for example

1558
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:46,690
and then finished with that

1559
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:53,330
when we experimentally study indicated so i just remind you have two processes elastic and

1560
01:46:53,330 --> 01:46:55,730
inelastic scattering where the that

1561
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:57,930
here's this kind of particles

1562
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:01,100
but you also have gamma spectroscopy here

1563
01:47:01,150 --> 01:47:02,390
when there is

1564
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:08,160
photons which are emitted and and then can construct the limits k so you have

1565
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,470
the ground state

1566
01:47:09,490 --> 01:47:11,460
so the lowest energy state

1567
01:47:11,470 --> 01:47:16,300
and then you have all the different excited states correspond to these things which are

1568
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:18,680
the transition between the states here

1569
01:47:18,710 --> 01:47:20,910
so this is really a way

1570
01:47:21,550 --> 01:47:25,350
it identifies any clues

1571
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:28,300
so now go back to

1572
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:31,050
modeling of the nucleus

1573
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:35,650
i you because of many features

1574
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:40,370
and it has been first interpret as if read as a child we could draw

1575
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,230
because of that

1576
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:47,510
you have the volume of the nucleus which is proportional to the number of nucleons

1577
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:49,560
this is similar in the drug

1578
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:53,540
when you have a volume of a drop of blood which is proportional to to

1579
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:55,700
the number of molecules

1580
01:47:55,730 --> 01:47:58,850
concerning the interaction among them about interactions

1581
01:47:58,870 --> 01:48:03,800
you see that in graph you don't have long range correlations between molecules

1582
01:48:04,850 --> 01:48:09,870
it's the same with the features of the experimental features

1583
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,240
proved that

1584
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:12,590
can be the same

1585
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:15,120
in any case so that's why

1586
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:20,280
and it is has been for described as a child he could draw

1587
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:23,460
so this is more than one stable about that's a care

1588
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:27,160
first it was used to describe the nuclear fission so

1589
01:48:27,670 --> 01:48:32,140
what they have done they have taken the energy of the system that they have

1590
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:33,150
so we

1591
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:39,070
our first example of

1592
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:44,990
linear programming with these generalized inequalities was second order cone programming it the second order

1593
01:48:46,070 --> 01:48:48,190
then the next obvious

1594
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:51,900
this would be the a semidefinite cone because we've seen that another

1595
01:48:51,910 --> 01:48:53,910
convex cone

1596
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:56,980
that means you have

1597
01:48:57,020 --> 01:49:00,970
the ten I's inequality respect to semi definite got

1598
01:49:00,980 --> 01:49:02,500
so if you write the normal

1599
01:49:02,950 --> 01:49:07,700
mathematics you would have a problem like this you minimize linear function of x

1600
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:11,480
and then you have and a journalist equality respect symmetric

1601
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:12,930
matrix inequality

1602
01:49:13,010 --> 01:49:18,380
that means that this been combination of symmetric matrices a i coefficients x i

1603
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:19,630
if there is an b

1604
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:23,730
four different minus the left hand side is positive semi

1605
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,100
it's called a semidefinite programme it looks like a a linear programme

1606
01:49:28,150 --> 01:49:29,970
except you have made

1607
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:32,070
the and AI i smitten with this

1608
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:34,370
and that's matrix inequality

1609
01:49:34,730 --> 01:49:39,140
and actually that's the most of the three so lps can be written as a

1610
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:43,070
source in business to business he has can be written as the

1611
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:45,680
maybe of interest

1612
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:46,930
then for example

1613
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:50,600
the application of this would be

1614
01:49:50,610 --> 01:49:56,280
two minimize what you want to minimize the maximum i value symmetric matrix a

1615
01:49:56,290 --> 01:50:00,830
and a is a linear function of the optimisation variables x

1616
01:50:00,990 --> 01:50:03,020
they have access just constant

1617
01:50:03,070 --> 01:50:05,370
six one the constant

1618
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:09,430
that's just another way of saying that have symmetric matrix a of x

1619
01:50:09,450 --> 01:50:11,700
and every entry in a

1620
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:14,880
it's a linear function of x

1621
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:19,590
we've seen that that's a convex function follows from this that the example of the

1622
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:21,440
supreme en route

1623
01:50:21,450 --> 01:50:26,250
but that doesn't tell you how to actually minimising the the context

1624
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:31,360
could have been solving this is to set up an SDP

1625
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:35,910
and yet that follows so it's a variable t and then you look at this

1626
01:50:35,910 --> 01:50:41,280
matrix inequality a very good with the times the identity matrix

1627
01:50:41,290 --> 01:50:46,550
and that's equivalent to saying that maximize value of a very

1628
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:49,520
because a is less than t

1629
01:50:49,530 --> 01:50:56,220
i in the matrix inequalities since all the bodies of a

1630
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,780
you see what i like

1631
01:50:58,830 --> 01:51:02,150
i was at this scale

1632
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:05,690
inequality in

1633
01:51:07,770 --> 01:51:11,060
but this scattering on the actual function of x

1634
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:14,120
if you minimize here you can

1635
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:17,210
expected in this the very have linear

1636
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:19,150
simple linear functions of x

1637
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:22,880
but you have omitted in the core itself can cause

1638
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:29,660
and you can verify that sinister be because you have the variables are now expressed

1639
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:31,630
this additional table t

1640
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:34,300
minimizing linear function of the variable

1641
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:37,920
and in the constrained to have a symmetric matrix

1642
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,980
in fact the in all the elements of this matrix are linear in x

1643
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:43,610
that's why you need

1644
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:51,700
so that gives you a practical way of solving that i value minimisation problem

1645
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:56,500
we can do the same for the matrix on eigenvectors rectangular matrix

1646
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,930
and again is linearly dependent on x

1647
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:02,800
you want to minimize the norm for the maximum so you

1648
01:52:02,810 --> 01:52:07,800
and there similar trick you can use to write as the matrix inequalities norm of

1649
01:52:07,810 --> 01:52:09,430
a president

1650
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:11,340
if it this was a

1651
01:52:11,390 --> 01:52:14,070
that's all it i got is present the square

1652
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:18,150
and to show that according to this

1653
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:20,940
and you get this is

1654
01:52:21,190 --> 01:52:25,640
so again this is a convex but quite a convex function of x you know

1655
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:28,650
that already because an enormous convex

1656
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:33,220
also that maximizes value norm of a matrix is convex but that doesn't really tell

1657
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:35,080
you how you minimize

1658
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:36,840
by setting it up as an SDP

1659
01:52:36,890 --> 01:52:38,490
you get a practical

1660
01:52:38,510 --> 01:52:42,120
method for actually solving

1661
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:47,130
then recently one of the reasons why people are interested in semidefinite programming is that

1662
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:53,410
they are used as relaxations or very difficult combinatorial nonconvex problem

1663
01:52:53,430 --> 01:52:54,900
so one example would be

1664
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:59,380
this was i haven't discussed problem minimize x minus p two norm

1665
01:52:59,410 --> 01:53:03,140
subject to bullying can i say excise could one

1666
01:53:03,190 --> 01:53:06,390
so the components of the variables must be plus or minus one

1667
01:53:06,490 --> 01:53:11,600
so that in general vary depending on most cases made able to be very difficult

1668
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,910
to come for problem

1669
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:18,010
and because you may have to enumerate all possible choices for x

1670
01:53:18,030 --> 01:53:21,040
but it's impossible to fix

1671
01:53:24,630 --> 01:53:27,040
the relation appears as follows

1672
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:28,890
the first try that n

1673
01:53:28,910 --> 01:53:34,000
it could have occurred on the second problem i small c is actually my next

1674
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:38,940
and i would use matrix variable capital c

1675
01:53:38,950 --> 01:53:41,600
that's because easy transport

1676
01:53:41,650 --> 01:53:43,620
c is actually the original variables

1677
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:47,740
the is capital c is omitted variables and fish

1678
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:50,750
this inequality constraints

1679
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:53,890
so then the rest of the problem can now if you had this equality constraint

1680
01:53:53,910 --> 01:53:57,320
can be written as just linear function of

1681
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:59,810
for example saying excites credits one

1682
01:53:59,860 --> 01:54:03,590
it is the same as saying that the value of this matrix is one

1683
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:05,900
because he is given by the transpose

1684
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:08,550
on the other hand we have the

1685
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:09,960
these constraints

1686
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:11,430
this policy

1687
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:16,240
i just saying could linear constraints on the

1688
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:20,090
also if you work at the coefficient the objective have the norm of a minus

1689
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:22,480
convex functions of X

1690
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:25,690
but if you're also looking for a method for solving this

1691
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:30,270
then this is not that simple because it's also very non-differentiable

1692
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:39,570
so if you look at the Hessian for example in the points where it's diefferentiable the Hession

1693
01:54:39,570 --> 01:54:40,980
is just zero

1694
01:54:41,090 --> 01:54:44,000
so it's not easy to solve using newton method or a gradient method

1695
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:47,900
and so on but it's easy solve as an LP

1696
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:49,750
so you

1697
01:54:49,770 --> 01:54:53,880
to write this as a linear programming problem we introduce new variable T

1698
01:54:54,090 --> 01:54:56,730
and then add an inequality

1699
01:54:56,750 --> 01:55:01,440
for each of these components in the maximum that says that A transpose X plus BI

1700
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:03,020
is then T

1701
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:04,750
and we optimize this

1702
01:55:04,790 --> 01:55:07,820
linear program over T and X jointly

1703
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:12,290
it's an LP because everything is linear in T the objective and the constraints are all linear

1704
01:55:12,290 --> 01:55:12,860
in T

1705
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:19,000
and then it's also not difficult to see that if I minimize over T

1706
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:23,520
and X jointly that's equivalent to solving this problem

1707
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:28,630
and to see that you can just assume that suppose X is fixed in this problem it's not a variable but

1708
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:30,170
you only minimize over T

1709
01:55:30,630 --> 01:55:34,360
so if you minimize T is subject to this MM lower bounds on T

1710
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:39,940
then obviously the optimal value of T will be this value the maximum of those lower bounds

1711
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:43,400
so that's if you fix X and optimize over T

1712
01:55:43,790 --> 01:55:48,670
and then if you minimize jointly over X and T then the optimal solution will be

1713
01:55:48,670 --> 01:55:53,130
the value of X that minimizes this and T will be maximum

1714
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:57,270
so it's equivalent to this and this gives you practical way of solving this

1715
01:55:57,270 --> 01:56:01,610
piece-wise linear optimization problem

1716
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:07,610
so an application of this are the one norm or infinity norm

1717
01:56:07,630 --> 01:56:11,590
in minimization problems so suppose I want to minimize one norm or the infinity norm

1718
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:15,210
of an function X minus B

1719
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:22,500
so these are we know already that these are convex functions of X

1720
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:24,940
because norms are convex

1721
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:28,730
you can solve them

1722
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:31,480
and practice using linear programming

1723
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:35,290
and the argument or the reason is very similar for example if you look at the

1724
01:56:35,290 --> 01:56:39,210
one norm you would introduce a number of variables Y one for

1725
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:41,750
each row in A X minus B

1726
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:48,380
you introduce linear inequalities per lower bounds A minus B and then you minimize the sum of the Y's subject to these

1727
01:56:49,570 --> 01:56:52,400
and again it's

1728
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:54,820
easy to see that these are equivalent

1729
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:57,020
so assume again that X is fixed

1730
01:56:57,060 --> 01:57:02,630
so AX minus B is just a given vector and then I minimize over Y

1731
01:57:02,650 --> 01:57:07,320
so that's a seperal optimization problem you can minimize of every component of Y separately

1732
01:57:07,630 --> 01:57:12,920
for each component Y I there are two lower bounds there's a lower bound Y I is greater than

1733
01:57:13,150 --> 01:57:17,040
the Ith component of this and greater than the negative of this is greater

1734
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:18,670
than the absolute value

1735
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:21,320
of the Ith component of X minus B

1736
01:57:21,730 --> 01:57:26,790
so the optimal value for Y Y I is the absolute value of the Ith component of

1737
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:28,110
A X minus B

1738
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:32,150
so that's if you fix X if you fix X

1739
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:38,750
each component of value would be the absolute value of the corresponding component of A X minus B so the value

1740
01:57:38,750 --> 01:57:41,420
some of those will be the one norm of X

1741
01:57:41,420 --> 01:57:42,650
of A X minus B

1742
01:57:42,670 --> 01:57:47,340
and then if you minimize over X and Y jointly by solving this LP

1743
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:50,880
and X and Y you minimize the one norm

1744
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:53,570
for the infinity norm you have a similar

1745
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:57,060
story except that instead of M

1746
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:05,730
variables you only have one extra variable Y and then you instead of a vector

1747
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:10,210
Y here you have Y times a vector of ones so you impose the same upper bound on

1748
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:15,150
each of the inequalities and that will minimize the maximum of the absolute values of A X

1749
01:58:15,190 --> 01:58:19,110
minus B

1750
01:58:19,150 --> 01:58:24,480
so this is of course very useful and it's also useful to look at the

1751
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:28,750
distributions you get by norm approximation with different norms

1752
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:33,130
so here I just take a random matrix A of size two hundred by eighty

1753
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:38,540
I minimize the adjusted two norm the discussed problem and the one norm of A X minus B

1754
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:44,270
and this is the distribution of the residual the two hundred residuals in the vector AX minus

1755
01:58:44,270 --> 01:58:51,190
B at those two solutions for the two norm and for the one norm

1756
01:58:51,230 --> 01:58:55,270
and the green chorus of course are the penalty functions you impose on each

1757
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:58,860
residual for the two norm you have quadratic penalty function for the one norm it's the

1758
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:00,070
absolute value

1759
01:59:00,110 --> 01:59:05,240
so then you see that roughly speaking this two problems of course do the same they try to write

1760
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:07,900
B as a linear combination of the columns of A

1761
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:14,020
so roughly speaking I try to do same thing but the distributions you obtain are very different

1762
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:18,150
and there are actually two important differences that are useful

1763
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:23,150
so one is you notice that the of course the high peak at zero if you

1764
01:59:23,210 --> 01:59:24,130
use the one norm

1765
01:59:24,650 --> 01:59:30,980
and that's explained by the fact that absolute value has this breakpoint or this

1766
01:59:31,090 --> 01:59:33,130
breakpoint at one at zero

1767
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:37,190
but as the two norm minimizes the quadratic

1768
01:59:37,230 --> 01:59:39,560
penalty function which is flat at the origin

1769
01:59:39,860 --> 01:59:44,570
so there's no benne benefit here if you choose X and moving it from something close

1770
01:59:44,570 --> 01:59:46,670
to zero to exactly zero

1771
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:50,190
whereas if you use the one norm actually you keep getting a benefit

1772
01:59:50,230 --> 01:59:52,480
by making it moving it all the way to zero
