1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
so in other words we have to do some kind of collaboration

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,590
and so on

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,760
this means that that the subject has to assume certain brain states

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,540
and then

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,940
we use that

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,670
to do statistical inference

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,570
from what we have measured

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,410
three different trials

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,600
for example

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,800
try to infer in in for what is the left in this and the rightness

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,120
of some certain brain activity

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,880
and so this is the

13
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,760
offline training part

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,060
and just

15
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,330
two to clarify so

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,590
if you would come to the lab

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,170
somebody put put the cap on your head

18
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,390
that would take some time

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,870
maybe thirty minutes

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,630
we're not as good as the people in all the new that they can do

21
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,870
this in ten minutes or fifteen minutes i was quite amazed for the technician and

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,940
then you would

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,090
do the following

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,940
so you

25
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,840
with the video says is that you should relax

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,680
and now

27
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,950
you will see later on the screen and what you see the letter

28
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,530
you should imagine the respective hand

29
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,970
relax left again

30
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,170
and right

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,200
and so this could go on for about ten twenty minutes

32
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,210
some of us

33
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,070
consider this extremely boring

34
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,410
for example i do and i sleep after five minutes so for this reason we

35
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:57,130
always had to find algorithms that can deal with a few data points

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,670
so if you have twenty minutes of data then we have about a hundred trials

37
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,520
on each side and you can actually also see you actually have experienced how difficult

38
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,060
it is to be relaxed

39
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,740
and focused at the same time

40
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,620
because you really have to keep the timing

41
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,760
you have

42
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,390
don your imagination of left and right with recorded some brain signals and then the

43
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,840
idea is to get some

44
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,710
some classifiers

45
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,840
to infer what your brain has been up to

46
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,640
what your brain has been up to so this it's it's about

47
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,930
individual differences

48
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,500
and so

49
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,650
after we've done that that's the upper part

50
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,780
we measure

51
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,210
we have some labelled trials we two featureextraction machine learning

52
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,920
then we can go into the

53
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,470
feedback session and we just take a window

54
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,160
and classifier where this is left to right or or maybe nothing either

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,190
so it's an asynchronous BCI

56
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,240
and this is where

57
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,800
benjamin will take over

58
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,410
to torture with tall tree with some mass

59
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:53,700
o my intention was not to fortune with my and it's it's meant to be

60
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,540
a very

61
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,800
practical course i'm not

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,950
introduce some fancy can reasons or talk about and find

63
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,430
this but would be very

64
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,850
practical entropy

65
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,070
and between them and the church

66
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,070
there was room full freedom to grow up

67
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,800
freedom was the kind of an accident it came about because the usual ways of

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,780
doing things were not possible

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,540
into some of that space

70
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,780
towns and cities reappeared

71
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,010
and with new supports for freedom

72
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,540
taking advantage of the rivalries i mentioned they obtained charters from the local powers establishing

73
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,410
the rights

74
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,710
to conduct their own affairs and to govern themselves in italy

75
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,900
some of these cities were able to gain control of the surrounding country

76
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,820
and the become city-states

77
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,860
resembling those of the ancient greek

78
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,100
autonomy was

79
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:01,200
assisted by the continuing struggles between popes and emperors between church and state again a

80
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,000
thoroughly unique western experience

81
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,180
in the states

82
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,300
the modern world began to take form

83
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,930
although the people are mainly christians

84
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,440
their life and outlook became increasingly secular

85
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,860
and not only in italy but in other cities north of the alps

86
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,860
a rose a worldview

87
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:29,450
that celebrated the greatness and dignity of mankind which was a very sharp turning away

88
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,620
from the medieval western tradition that put

89
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:38,600
god and life in the hereafter at the centre of everything

90
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,920
this new vision is revealed with flamboyant confidence

91
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,540
p co

92
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,690
delamere around a lot of florentine

93
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,270
i thinker

94
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,270
who said wrote the following

95
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,590
god told me that

96
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:59,200
meaning god have made the neither heaven nor

97
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,300
neither moral nor in more

98
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,670
so that with the freedom of choice

99
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,630
and with on

100
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,140
as though the maker and molde of myself

101
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,910
dummies fashion by itself in whatever shape that shelter for

102
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,510
supreme generosity of god the father

103
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,130
all highest and the most grateful city of man

104
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,280
to him

105
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,670
it is granted to have whatever he chooses

106
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,710
to be

107
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,620
what ever he will

108
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,190
now this is a remarkable leap

109
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,040
even beyond the humanism of the greeks

110
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,530
something brand new in the world

111
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,020
according to this view man is not merely the measure of all things as the

112
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,860
greek sophist protagonist

113
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,500
radically proclaimed in the fifth century

114
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,860
he is in fact says got more

115
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,620
then more

116
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,690
he is unlimited by nature

117
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,740
is is entirely free

118
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,320
to shape themselves

119
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,770
and to acquire

120
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,080
whatever he wants

121
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,750
please observe two that it is not his reason that will determine the human actions

122
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,020
but his will

123
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,200
a lot

124
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,990
of the moderating control

125
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,580
of reasons

126
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,710
another florentine machiavelli

127
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,190
moved further in the same direction

128
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,140
for him and i quote

129
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,460
fortune is a woman

130
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,360
and it is necessary to hold it down

131
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,740
and beta

132
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,660
and fight with

133
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,560
the notion that the greeks would have regarded as dangerously arrogant

134
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,100
and certain to produce disaster would have seen this as an example of the words

135
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,800
they use and we'll talk about a lot in this course the address

136
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:04,060
this kind of violence paragons which comes upon meant when they see themselves as more

137
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,920
human and behave as though

138
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,720
they were divided

139
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,360
francis bacon

140
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,850
influenced by machiavelli

141
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,010
early human beings to employ their reasons

142
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,930
to force nature to give up its secrets

143
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,590
to treat nature like a woman

144
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,590
to master nature in order to improve man's material well-being

145
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,380
he assumed that such a course would lead to progress and the general improvement of

146
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,060
the human condition

147
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,090
and it was that sort of thinking

148
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,360
that lay at the heart of the scientific revolution

149
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:44,760
and remains the face on which modern science and technology progress

150
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,550
a couple of other english political philosophers hobbes and locke

151
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,660
apply a similar novelty and modernity to the sphere of politics

152
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,760
basing their understanding

153
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,490
on the common passions of man

154
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,040
for a comfortable cell preservation

155
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,640
and discovering something the greeks had never thought of something they call

156
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,670
natural rights

157
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,560
that belong to a man

158
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,950
either as part of nature

159
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,890
or is the gift of benevolent and reasonable got

160
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,810
man was seen as a solitary creature

161
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,970
not inherently a part of society

162
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,490
that's totally on greek

163
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,760
and the basic rights which seem to be

164
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,890
huge contributions to our field especially to planning and reinforcement learning

165
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,700
it is also done incredibly well in stage where he regularly wins awards

166
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:47,710
so we were for good reason for certain but it is

167
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,210
it is also

168
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,120
things that

169
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,300
i have also led to several reports critical legislative is

170
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,910
next crosswords

171
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,640
hence the meetings of the national

172
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,850
cross borders

173
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,780
it's more about

174
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,640
and it's a great pleasure

175
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,990
thanks very much

176
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,920
just as it just as a quick

177
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,320
check but c so people who are here how many of you already know reinforcement

178
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,570
learning and are working in the field

179
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,950
we have

180
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:29,390
i see and why am i giving you to talk i like just a chance

181
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,270
first of all you know i had together so i those who are left how

182
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,970
many are here because there's really does nothing else to do incorporate now

183
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,990
gets three hands

184
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,770
six miles and then the rest how many people here actually interested in learning about

185
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:48,520
the background here and but are already aware of it in many ways

186
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,720
i could swear that the some of the same hands are going up but right

187
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,610
but that's okay i'm going to do my best ipod for people who are already

188
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,020
doing this stuff and i apologize in advance i'm lately teaching why they have been

189
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,500
introduction introductory computer science for people who are going into computer science so i think

190
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,470
that kind of adopted a little bit of

191
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,390
low-level kind of presentation style i apologize in advance if you're an expert already and

192
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,140
you'll hear that

193
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,410
but that's what i'm going to do and

194
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,140
beyond that would also want to tell you that benefit your work in this area

195
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,890
and inside you i'm sorry but asking a loaded question at the end we say

196
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,160
you know how does this relate to the work of energy and i'll talk about

197
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,520
how cool uris

198
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,110
excellent right so i'll be talking to model based reinforcement learning

199
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,550
basic the basic flow here is to talk a little bit of background lies about

200
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,240
markov decision processes and reinforcement learning general because

201
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,740
model based reinforcement learning is a special kind of reinforcement learning so it so we

202
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,420
need to make sure that we're on the same page about what reinforcement learning is

203
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:57,420
the bulk of what i'm going to talk about is as the problem of efficient

204
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,580
exploration how is it that we can create algorithms are going to explore the environments

205
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,980
and be able to perform nearly optimal

206
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,260
but with bounds on how much experience it takes to do that

207
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,770
so that's an area that's that i've been focused on quite a bit of my

208
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,200
own research with my students my lab and so that the most what to talk

209
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,120
about later become very intrigued by bayesian reinforcement learning and its connection to efficient exploration

210
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,990
and i don't tell you about that and then the bottleneck here is learning algorithms

211
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,020
that are very good at acquiring their own models but then they actually have to

212
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,800
plan with them and so there's a bottleneck there and i'll talk a little bit

213
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,390
about what some of the current approaches are for

214
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,950
for planning with these learned models and also fascinated by

215
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,180
the connection to human cognition so i'll just mention a little bit about that

216
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,170
i would say more except i don't know that much more but i'm fascinated by

217
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,050
it so if you have information about i'd be happy to hear more about it

218
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,520
another some workshops going on that

219
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,460
whistler at the end of maps that they get not particularly remarkable is reinforcement learning

220
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,020
but various issues about how people learn and what that tells us about machine learning

221
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,310
and vice versa

222
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,340
so i definitely encourage interested people to get involved in that are so i forgot

223
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,680
to set this up but i think

224
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,950
i think we can start off with the game

225
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,090
people already know this game in which case that would be kind of unfair it's

226
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,520
not that many about the many

227
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,610
all right here you

228
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,360
this is a little video game

229
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,080
actually on saturday student and i went to

230
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,520
the quaker bridge mall in new jersey we we have laws in new jersey and

231
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,140
and people actually do this and we recorded their the results and you're going to

232
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,480
do much much better than the people in the model did and the reason i

233
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,140
say that is because i've given this in talks many times and had a good

234
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,730
guess as to how it was going to go on the mall it didn't go

235
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,480
as well as i was hoping would go so so here's the game this is

236
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,550
what you see this is your input state information and your goal is to win

237
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,530
the game and its that you get to make a series of decisions each step

238
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,740
you get to choose up down left right

239
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,470
a or b

240
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,650
if you've seen this to please don't say anything because you ruin it for the

241
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,540
rest of us were trying to have fun so OK so that you tell me

242
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,090
what you want to do up down left right a or b

243
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:13,550
alright i heard a belonging to do the opposite was louder

244
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,860
you may think for a moment and you have to tell me the next thing

245
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,190
to do because the you have one yet

246
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,930
i had read again i hit rate again

247
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:29,510
up and right up to them both

248
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,530
up right

249
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,600
confidence a

250
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,130
left a week

251
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,690
was too many things at once

252
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,610
no i did i did

253
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,730
i would be

254
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,380
he down

255
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,980
that's the time when you make noise that was very good

256
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:02,990
the people in the mall did make noise i was i was very disappointed

257
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,490
left left

258
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,250
this fine

259
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,720
i'm getting the probability distribution of actions back which is very nice

260
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,470
so wait i think i can be but it didn't seem to be did you

261
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,810
one congratulations on so

262
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,310
i to shopping in the mall on saturday

263
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,690
i need to actually stop the experiment gone and i ran upstairs to the video

264
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,740
game store and ask the people in the video games to come down and help

265
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:45,740
us to boehringer for our experiment so people what what non people were doing they

266
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,750
bumble around a little bit then eventually figured out that they were controlling the orange

267
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,720
square some of them

268
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:56,110
actually managed to go and visit the little circle thing and maybe even picked up

269
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,180
baby and maybe even walked around with it but they never quite figured out what

270
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,420
was supposed to go it supposed to go

271
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,790
right you read

272
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,130
of the form

273
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:11,880
a x b prime the exclamation marks of this is that

274
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,330
object x has value v

275
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,080
for attribute a

276
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,040
and again i have an exclamation mark because it could be no node has exactly

277
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,440
one value for each attribute OK now what i do is

278
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,880
for each line in the CPT

279
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,830
the bayesian network has a conditional probability table for the chosen function of its parents

280
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:35,190
and going to define a clause or a conjunction for each line

281
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,100
and the way to that class

282
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,130
it's going to correspond to the to the probability critical it's going to be the

283
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,250
log odds of the probability the table

284
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,040
OK so very straightforward translation from the vision network

285
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:51,350
two markov logic networks and there is no loss of representational efficiency

286
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,630
now of course in practice people almost never use vision networks with full cpts is

287
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,670
because those get too large

288
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,690
just like potential function get too large

289
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,960
these things like context specific independence

290
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,170
context specific independencies where you're conditional model for child as a function of its parents

291
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,330
is not table but is decision tree

292
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,330
this is potentially much more compact

293
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,400
so how would represent alchemy

294
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,480
very simple

295
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,040
what we have is one clause for each path in the decision tree

296
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,920
remember each by the decision tree corresponds to a rule that rule becomes the rule

297
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,540
in the AML and the with the weight of rule is log odds of the

298
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:35,770
probability of the other class or the child attribute given the state of the variables

299
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,810
along the path

300
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,080
and i think that people often use you know is logistic regression so your child's

301
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,270
logistic regression and the parents were decided do that

302
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,440
and then another thing that's popular that will reveal it two is noisy or

303
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,960
we implement noisy or an MLN is as deterministic or is of logical function plus

304
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,210
a bunch of pairwise causes that represent the filippo

305
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,270
so pretty much all the all the major ways in which people build new models

306
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:12,060
for bayesian networks can be easily represented in markov logic

307
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,350
but no of course the payoff is that

308
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,500
now you can do more than just the vision network now you can start to

309
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,850
talk about dependencies between objects and you can do rich kinds of modelling than than

310
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,420
than the traditional business in particular we can see

311
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,880
you can do the various kinds of relational models that we saw before knocking so

312
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,900
for example

313
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,540
how do you do knowledge based model construction of the basic thing that you have

314
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,980
to do is to allow only horn clauses

315
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:43,380
in case only have one hundred so if markov logic with unknown causes you essentially

316
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,080
get knowledge based model construction

317
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,080
this is going to it basically does the same thing as bayes nets except that

318
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,190
in bayes nets

319
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,940
you only have relations of one particular for binary relations with the with object always

320
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,400
the first arguement here you can not have arbitrary relations another different combination functions that

321
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,790
people using KBMC we deciding to let you know logistic regression noisy or or you

322
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,670
could find some other function externally and link it

323
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,610
what about stochastic logic programs

324
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,400
well stochastic logic programs are generalizations of PCFG is and where it is so hard

325
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,350
to pcfgs so again we're going to allow only horn clauses

326
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,190
the weight of clause now is going to be the log of the probability that

327
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,600
the course heading the SLP

328
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,080
and i need to have the same form as that i have been pcfgs which

329
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,730
is to say if they had holes in exactly one body holds no more no

330
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,730
and this implements and SLP

331
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,980
here and how to implement them

332
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,850
well the basic construction appearance may to to first order logic is that you will

333
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,270
only binary relations

334
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,380
so we need to make the same restriction on markov logic

335
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,650
you will only binary relations and then what you get has a similar expressivity to

336
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,420
probabilistic relational models

337
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,130
now again what you get here is similar to bayes nets except

338
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,730
that be bayes nets the predicates are also all binary except that now the first

339
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,370
arguement can vary

340
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,810
i can be talking about multiple objects at the same time as opposed to always

341
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,580
only the properties of the same object

342
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,110
what about relational markov networks

343
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:16,480
well remember relational markov networks specify the model of the conjunctive SQL queries

344
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,100
well you can equally well expressed them in datalog

345
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,270
and that log is a special case of first order logic right so once we

346
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,470
want to converted the SQL to datalog that's in the long query can just be

347
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,830
in the

348
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,880
the corresponding formal in the MLS

349
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,080
so that's the structure part then what happens is that there are admins remember specify

350
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,650
the full distribution the the full potential function

351
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,850
breach quickly create in this way and we do this now is by having one

352
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,650
clause in the MLN for each state of the clique

353
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,060
and again the weight of that clause is going to correspond to the to the

354
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,630
value of the potential function for that which

355
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,670
OK now this could be a bit cumbersome light if you have you know pretty

356
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,930
things which most cases plus

357
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,120
and then afterwards we find out the truth

358
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,930
and now we know it can be f two for example we cross out all

359
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,410
the inconsistency functions

360
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,500
and we continue to the next example

361
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,580
it is

362
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,850
we can now look at the computer functions that are still alive when crossed to

363
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,820
the majority of their predictions

364
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,830
it's plus

365
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,310
and we find out the truth

366
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,640
minus we can cross that none of the function and so on this repeat

367
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,670
any questions about

368
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,570
this intuitive al

369
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:37,800
so what can you say about this is very easy to analyse this of look

370
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,630
every time this algorithm majority of makes a mistake

371
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,920
we know that we've crossed out half of the functions in our family

372
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,600
right because because we predicted according majority if we made a mistake if the majority

373
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,290
made a mistake that means crossing out the majority of functions

374
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,320
it can be too many left so we're crossing out the majority every time

375
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,530
then we can only make

376
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,480
log base two of the number of

377
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,270
functions before mistakes before we've crossed that everyone and we can cross that everyone we're

378
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,610
assuming that there someone who doesn't make any mistakes

379
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,890
so we already have this nice

380
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,510
guarantee that the area of

381
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,910
this majority function on the data is not more than

382
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,460
only a log in the size of the

383
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,720
dataset divided by n

384
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,680
how many people here are familiar with VC dimension and things like that

385
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,230
great so

386
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,650
some of these things might start looking familiar to you hopefully as we go along

387
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,460
these bounds you get here and all the corresponding once you've seen from

388
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,500
VC dimension

389
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,320
so it as we said the online learning setting is is is

390
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,240
at least as hard as the batch setting so that means that in batch setting

391
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,660
we can also get to guarantee

392
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,660
like this OK

393
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:58,240
so what do we do in the batch setting

394
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,740
so suppose there are some

395
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,690
again the batch setting let's do the same

396
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,590
the same warm-up setting where there is some perfect function if there is some perfect

397
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,080
so we now get a lot of data advance we get and is the data

398
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,030
the nice thing would be to select a consistent function

399
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,180
and here's an example where

400
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,210
that will work OK

401
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,090
in this example

402
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,100
i want to show that basically what i want to show you is that that

403
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,350
in in the back setting you're not going to do i mean we know you

404
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,500
can do as well as he did in the online setting we can actually do

405
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,390
much better so the bat setting that take some consistent

406
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,970
function here

407
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,380
it might be that there was that one perfect function and everyone else wasn't so

408
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,430
great maybe everyone else had this

409
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,520
ar here which is kind of what we're trying to

410
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,820
to guarantee

411
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,310
so if everyone else had that error rate

412
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,940
if you work it out

413
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,800
but there may actually be one of those bad functions that

414
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,890
it didn't make any mistakes in the dataset

415
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,120
so what's the chance that someone who has an error rate

416
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,150
so this should be

417
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,720
on the distribution

418
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,960
but if it has ar g if it has this error rate in this mission

419
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,110
magenta didn't make any

420
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:16,530
mistakes is exactly this thing here

421
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,410
the image is right now one

422
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,470
inequality et cetera really big

423
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,320
OK so one

424
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,790
this is something that'll come up a couple times

425
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,530
so if you

426
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,660
take one minus over into the and you get about

427
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,870
e to the minus x that something is probably seen from

428
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,240
your basic calculus class

429
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,500
so this

430
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,380
of sorry finite set of functions

431
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,980
and how we can do that so we have to somehow kind of replace you

432
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,380
know groups of functions by one representative function

433
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,940
and then

434
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,070
you know that representative will hopefully take care of the whole group

435
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:05,020
and the way we try to do that is by

436
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:10,540
actually getting down to a finite sample of a finite set of examples

437
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,780
and and then by classification you can only have a finite set of things happening

438
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,210
on the sample

439
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,230
because you you know you can only do plus minus ones on these examples

440
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,920
but the problem is that we always have this test point which we don't know

441
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,340
what it is so the first thing we do is replace

442
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,710
the test point by ghost sample

443
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,210
and then we can sort of

444
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,590
argue just in terms of

445
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,250
two samples drawn from that distribution

446
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,920
and then it's a finite set

447
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,570
so this is known as the double sample trick

448
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:52,150
and it it effectively gets you from dealing with an unknown test example to just

449
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,590
dealing with two

450
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:58,710
random samples one is your training set one is the ghost sample

451
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,590
so it's it's a

452
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,340
useful trick that can be applied again i'm trying to sort of you know give

453
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,770
you little sort of units of

454
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,650
thinking that you could use in different contexts

455
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,900
so this is how the double sample trick works

456
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,880
what you're interested in doing is again you know think in terms of bounding the

457
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,980
probability of being misled things going wrong whatever so we were interested in the probability

458
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,420
that there exists a function

459
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,170
but again i just taking the zero training error for simplicity

460
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,980
has zero training error

461
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,920
true error

462
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,570
bigger than long

463
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:38,090
and what we want to do is to replace that probability by the probability that

464
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,280
we have two samples x and y gain both generated i i d and there

465
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,730
is an edge in function class that looks good on the first half bad on

466
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,940
the second half

467
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,020
and notice that there are

468
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,980
the probability is twice here and there next on two here

469
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,710
so we sort of replace the test error by a finite sample

470
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,270
there are basically three

471
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,360
events concerned one is that the

472
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,880
training error zero

473
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,920
the other is that it has high

474
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,400
generalisation error and the third is that has a high

475
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,840
error on the

476
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,590
on the ghost sample

477
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:26,750
and the point about this is that if it has tried to high generalisation error

478
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,420
then with high probability it's going to have

479
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,050
a high

480
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:35,500
error on the ghost sample because we you the ghost sample is generated

481
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,550
so there's no reason for it to

482
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,300
mislead us

483
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,800
you know we're we're trying to

484
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,960
use the

485
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
training sample to do all sorts of

486
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,900
nasty stuff which makes it likely that we're gonna be misled by the training example

487
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,900
because with training our algorithms on the ghost sample is is independent

488
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,170
so the

489
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,570
this is basically encapsulated in this statement here so probability that this is the

490
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:10,270
the ghost sample having high error given that there is zero training error and the

491
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,480
generalisation error is paul

492
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,250
it is actually this

493
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,170
ghost sample doesn't care about the training sample as separate samples can just throw away

494
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,980
so it's just the probability that the

495
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,610
there is high

496
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,980
are on the on the ghost sample given that there is a higher and truer

497
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,570
and that's very clearly

498
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,340
just the binomial tail bound it's very easy to show that that's going to be

499
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,730
big than point five

500
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,840
for reasonable

501
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,360
sizes of training

502
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,670
i mean very in very small sizes

503
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,090
so this this now can be put together with the if we just do this

504
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,340
sequence here

505
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,860
probability over the double sample of

506
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,480
zero training error

507
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,730
and higher is bigger than

508
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,540
sorry and and high ghost sample error

509
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:04,690
is greater than or equal to just including in an extra condition that actually has

510
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,210
high generalisation error

511
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:11,600
and then we can just separate this into this probability and the conditional probability that

512
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,880
the conditional probability which is bounded by

513
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,690
and so

514
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,540
we can turn this around this is the half

515
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,940
and we get this quantity which is the thing we're interested in here

516
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,670
but how big is a finite set so the question is how many functions can

517
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,770
you get

518
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,000
when you look at just the finite set of examples e got function class h

519
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,020
which could

520
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,360
we know will have infinitely many functions potentially

521
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,500
we're going to restrict ourselves to looking at its performance on a finite set of

522
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,570
size and more in fact will be interested into and because of the double sample

523
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:50,800
and we're interested in how many functions do we actually get because those are are

524
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,270
equivalence classes we only have to think about those

525
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,020
well we're doing our analysis

526
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,670
and that's what we'll do the union bound over those

527
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:04,000
so we will actually have so i mean it could be as high as two

528
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:09,520
the end because there are to do the impossible functions classification functions on n points

529
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,110
and so the log of this number is less than or equal to n

530
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:17,300
but obviously we want to have much much smaller than that for the

531
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,210
the analysis to work

532
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,380
so if we just look at what happens if we plot this with a set

533
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,780
of linear functions in a twenty dimensional space

534
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,630
this is the ratio of BH of them to to to the end

535
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,730
so i to

536
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,820
about twenty one

537
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,670
or looks a bit higher but anyway up to

538
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,420
something close to

539
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,440
mention here

540
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,170
we get this ratio being equal to one

541
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,980
but then about

542
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,860
you know

543
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,320
twice the dimension

544
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:55,110
the things suddenly zooms down and the fraction rapidly gets very close to zero

545
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,820
and this is the kind of regime where learning kicks in where we can

546
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,150
get the number you know because we're going to be a union bound over this

547
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,500
ph and we want this number to be much much smaller

548
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,280
then the size of the training set in order to get the ratio to be

549
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:16,190
but this is this is looking like good news it looks like the number does

550
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,170
fall off

551
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,190
in the way that we would like

552
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,270
so the actual number of functions equivalence classes we need to consider

553
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,020
is small

554
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,460
and this is what about nature and increase dimension measure

555
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,940
OK so that each other

556
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,300
the dimension is the size for which we can get

557
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,110
find some examples and we can do every possible classification now the words it's the

558
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,400
point here

559
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,020
where this

560
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,340
curves leaves the

561
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,150
the value one and start the down below one

562
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:57,400
VC dimension is defined for general function classes not just the linear function classes

563
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,400
for linear function classes it just turns out that the VC dimension is the linear

564
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,770
dimension plus one

565
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:09,690
so what we're but we we can apply this idea of more generally so it's

566
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:14,770
just saying the largest sample size for which we can find some inputs

567
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,680
the pressure

568
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,160
at that location y

569
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,890
and that must be constant

570
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,300
and this now

571
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,290
new york

572
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:27,850
it is a

573
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,440
of energy

574
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,940
and as you i will show you it has a very remarkable

575
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,610
first i will show you an example

576
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,150
well by

577
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,550
i keep y constant

578
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,220
so i the true which changes diameter

579
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,450
the two is not changing

580
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,640
level why

581
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,040
as i do there

582
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,540
so i come in here

583
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,440
cross sectional area a one

584
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,360
why didn't it

585
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,470
cross sectional area

586
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,860
a two

587
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,200
why is the same for both

588
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,870
i have here

589
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,250
inside pressure one

590
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,300
i have pressure p two

591
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,750
this is the density of the fluid

592
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,930
there is zero velocity v two

593
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,500
and as your velocity v one

594
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,470
clearly the one is very large than the two

595
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,620
because a one

596
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,710
i'm one

597
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,490
must be a two

598
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,650
nine feet because the fluid is incompressible

599
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,090
the same amount of matter that flow through here in one second

600
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,450
must flow through here in one second

601
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,350
these have to be the same since a one is much smaller than a two

602
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,870
its velocity is much larger

603
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:04,180
then v two

604
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,140
i'm going to apply the new equation

605
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,660
for the first time tells me that one half

606
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,730
the ones created

607
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,560
i can forget the second term because i get the same term you is to

608
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,020
get there because they measure pressure here and i measure the pressure that have the

609
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,660
same level of y

610
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,080
so i can ignore the second term

611
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,560
plus b one

612
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,330
must be one half role

613
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,940
the two squared

614
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,100
must be two

615
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,980
that's what the new is equation tells me

616
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,770
now if one

617
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,060
is larger

618
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,910
then v two

619
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:45,040
the only way to this can be corrected

620
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,350
is that the one

621
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,000
must be less than two

622
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,350
he was a big deal well it's a big deal

623
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:54,330
because i would have guessed exactly the other way around and so would you

624
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,270
because here is where the highest velocities

625
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,500
and or instincts would say oh it's the velocity as high as a lot of

626
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,290
pressure it's exactly the other way around here is a low pressure and he has

627
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,520
a high pressure

628
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,810
which is one quite bizarre consequence

629
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,140
you must all have

630
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:23,520
encountered in your life what we call the size

631
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,480
we're using evil still used today

632
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,500
you have here

633
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,480
a bucket in general is used was water lakes

634
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,520
could be any liquid

635
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,770
and i sticking you're too

636
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:48,060
small diameter is substantially smaller than this area here

637
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:53,430
and there will be a warning you're up to this level

638
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:57,270
his level p two

639
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,930
y two

640
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,350
by one

641
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,770
increasing value of y

642
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:08,000
he high differences h

643
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,600
two is one atmosphere one there's atmosphere

644
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,370
here is it's open

645
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,660
then p one is also one atmosphere

646
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,890
so does every year

647
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,830
and there's liquid in you

648
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,890
i think is open and in my mouth

649
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:33,660
and i struck the water in sort of this fault with this war was

650
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,440
strange as it may be

651
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,250
it's like making the whole

652
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,600
this tank

653
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,830
if i take my finger off here

654
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,850
the what will start to run out and i will show you that

655
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,210
and you have your velocity

656
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,440
if you want

657
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,080
wonderful stream down into this year

658
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,230
and the velocity here is approximately zero

659
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,620
because this area is so much larger

660
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,350
and this cross sectional area

661
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,120
the two good approximation

662
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,660
this what is going down extremely slowly

663
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:09,560
let's call this by difference

664
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,620
i applied is

665
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,870
now we have a situation where the wise different

666
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,180
but the pressure is the same because right here

667
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,370
at this point of the liquid i have one atmosphere which is barometric pressure

668
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,440
and since is open to to the outside world p one is also one atmosphere

669
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,160
now i was my peter

670
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,960
there i lost my whiter

671
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,930
now i lose my peter

672
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,430
so now i have that one half role

673
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,660
the is role of the liquid

674
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:46,040
we want to create

675
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,770
rowe g

676
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,140
times y one

677
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,480
must be one rho

678
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,140
v two square but

679
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,620
we agree that was zero so i don't have that term

680
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,810
so i only have

681
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,370
she y two

682
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,580
i lose my cheese

683
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,560
i don't know much is

684
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,940
one of rose's group not this one

685
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,750
and so

686
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,310
i lose my role

687
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,890
this is one half

688
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,430
and my role

689
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,710
so you get one half

690
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,620
he wants clear

691
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,930
because g

692
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,810
times y two miners y one which is a to

693
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,440
so what you find

694
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,350
that this speed which which is what is running out here

695
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,310
if you want

696
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,790
is the square root

697
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,710
one of the gh

698
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:35,230
you've seen before

699
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,350
if you take a pebble

700
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,560
you really the pebble from this level you let it fall

701
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,060
it will reach this point here is level

702
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,810
this is the square root of two g h we've seen many times

703
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,000
so what is happening here

704
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,370
since the pressure terms and the same here and there

705
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,210
now it is only a conversion

706
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,600
gravitational potential energy which is higher here than there

707
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,640
it is now

708
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,710
converted to

709
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,640
kinetic energy

710
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,890
this is siphon would only work

711
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,790
if d is less than ten metres

712
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,350
because of the barometric pressure you can never suck up this water

713
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,890
no one can

714
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,480
a vacuum pump can here to level that is higher than ten metres

715
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,350
when i did the experiment there was no

716
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:23,040
cranberry juice i was able to get it up to five meters then leaders would

717
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,660
be the theoretical maximum

718
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,620
so this has to be less than ten metres

719
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,060
you go up

720
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,980
if i would have made a hole in this thank you

721
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,080
just like this

722
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,930
don't do exactly this level

723
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:39,810
and i would ask you to calculate with what what is running out

724
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:45,550
so this actually this he actually sees coming out as a result just kind a

725
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,130
real factor

726
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,930
but either i y is gone

727
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,740
what's the the i wireless

728
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,710
the key now

729
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,210
this is by the most fantastic form

730
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:04,030
in the i y is the same as the cosine why was it times the

731
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,800
why is a real number

732
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:13,140
so now i see the real part of this is that the the x cost

733
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,430
and the imaginary part the the one so there's pair

734
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:23,830
quite an interesting pair that we could add to our list either x cos y

735
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,580
and the exciting one

736
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,710
the that

737
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,530
that x is in the exponent

738
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,730
up there

739
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,360
and times cos why well

740
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:43,460
right i mean we can just better to check maybe what's the second or the

741
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:46,340
second x derivative of this thing

742
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:51,730
i i just want to see that this really is the winner

743
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,380
this if i take the second x derivative this

744
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,730
we're thinking

745
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,710
it doesn't change right

746
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,640
if i take the second wider of what happens

747
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:08,880
because negative because cosine becomes minus sign becomes minus cosine so so

748
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,440
and sure enough

749
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,460
two pieces

750
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,950
cancel each other

751
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,350
and it's also process equation

752
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,350
these are called

753
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:26,330
this is called if i use the word this is called an analytic function

754
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,160
who knows why

755
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:32,350
analytic function if it's if it's

756
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,170
very smooth has derivative and so forth

757
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,810
DNA the functions that we would sort first think

758
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:46,140
and these pieces of these pieces are called harmonic functions so so that says you

759
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,620
this is the harmonic function that's i mean plus equation is so important that it's

760
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,570
given the special name not

761
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,130
not a matter of great importance

762
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,910
now i still in

763
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,180
really say

764
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,360
why does this work

765
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,850
so we should be able somehow to see

766
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,460
so in some way

767
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:19,700
it works OK so the cost y and x i might have over there

768
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,230
as of here

769
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,960
OK so why does it work

770
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:29,430
let's see

771
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,160
i mean i think that if i take this function of experts i y it

772
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,790
will work too

773
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,820
and the last great i think that this the function of x experts i y

774
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:44,650
here here's the statement and the function of x one xi y will solve all

775
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,090
possible ways

776
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:50,170
now if i take the real part and imaginary part of still find but why

777
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:54,950
can you supply that internal classes equation

778
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:58,110
well let's see we don't know what the function is so how do we do

779
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:04,320
what happens if i take the derivative of a function of x i y remember

780
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,580
i just get the outskirts of the derivative will be f prime

781
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,970
the extra

782
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,800
but what's the y derivative of the extra

783
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:21,010
because the extra

784
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,140
what's the wider

785
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,890
of this thing

786
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,840
i'm not yet on the second derivatives distance

787
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,010
first of

788
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,800
remember how to take the derivative

789
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:37,740
the function of another function

790
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,360
the chain rule is the thing

791
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,750
so the derivative of this

792
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:47,290
the aspect of the y derivative about this memory you you take the derivative of

793
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:53,750
and then have to take the derivative of what's inside the argument

794
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,730
which is the y derivative of that is

795
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,860
where the extra but it was if we really use the chain rule was the

796
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:12,950
derivative of the function times the derivative of what's inside the extra what's inside was

797
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,310
just one OK

798
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,650
so that's the extra

799
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,430
now let me do the x x through

800
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:25,560
Due to adaptation is that we read and that both demarcate according to that of

801
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:30,540
course of readership and also was a target distribution

802
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,080
look it's so that the chorus and so so you knew you could you propose

803
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,980
according to exist at the state gave you will accept or reject the new will

804
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:47,430
dates and estimate dollars a year cause violence of the target distribution which we view

805
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:51,650
with all sorts of compartments of the increment distribution and the new we know that

806
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:57,690
this is a global scale of low value of your goal of winning a kind

807
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:01,040
of just 2 to convince you that it's the walls y to do is that

808
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,520
this is so that I haven't been dimension did call 12 the target distribution is

809
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:14,500
a normal distribution this governed but got around to conditions members 100 which is not

810
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:24,150
that that that is not extreme and here pupils according to the increment distribution which

811
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:30,820
the along all covert project which is the identity and marries the optimal skating and

812
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:35,950
I assure you just out of the clouds so it should be

813
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:47,130
1000 website with those instrumentation taken from Ireland and projected on the largest of the

814
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:52,000
the 2 first-round disagree news is that it's it's the change

815
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,520
it is extremely bad weather makes

816
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,850
the big thing is extremely bad and you just visits you are as a cloud

817
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:03,370
is extremely solid which is also

818
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:12,560
look at the trajectory of each competencies although so also the correlation coefficients also mixing

819
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:15,760
In those that

820
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:22,040
the judge orders them where are you are you proposing now according to sources with

821
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:28,280
the 2nd provided the target distribution and consider the cloud much good correlation is much

822
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:36,040
better than the club also spread over isn't the ellipsis industries which adopted

823
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,370
so perhaps I assured

824
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:45,710
Brokers Armenia treating improvements to be that can be done here

825
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,520
Of course I just want to invest 5 minutes it we just want to describe

826
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:57,870
that another type of allegories and where this time I I use of media metropolis

827
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:03,760
things but instead of proposing according to a random walk and propose according to independent

828
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:12,110
proposals so this time of year when what you do is that you pupils from

829
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:18,540
the division Q which is selected independently from the busses of you propose according to

830
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,950
distribution and you accept

831
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,970
this time with this ratio

832
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,130
so what you can do what you feel that this is rather easy to prove

833
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,540
is that the detainees do it again body if and only if

834
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:36,520
the target distribution in the will distributions of poisonous

835
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:41,890
relations and the rate of convergence is controlled by the consent and so the idea

836
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:45,630
is that in this type of algorithm what you need to it to obtain the

837
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:50,630
fastest rate of convergence of new shows that the 2 spoke polls according to distribution

838
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:56,320
which is which is which resembled target distribution executives said thing that you do for

839
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:02,820
example exit projected extremely close zone with assisting reasonable proposal is extremely close to accept

840
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:09,610
reject mechanism in the only differs somewhat way is accepted it you can is is

841
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:14,170
that you don't look too little of the bounding constants

842
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:18,850
Britain's ratios a proposal institutions

843
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:25,170
so I what don't want to do that uses a technique which is rather than

844
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,980
the standard in an important something judge us so you you you start with a

845
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:36,670
biology from your problem distribution we still constraints of 2 constraints are are you you

846
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:41,210
should you choose family which is easy to sample from the course in the the

847
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:45,190
the single constraint is that you want to family which is flexible enough in order

848
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:50,410
to capture most of the details of the target distribution Indiana you want a lot

849
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:55,720
of time in which a kind of universal approximation process and the what you do

850
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,930
that as I said before ah

851
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:02,580
what you can prove is that to the speed of convergence is maximized when she

852
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:08,870
Wiesel resemble to crying and whether we win there's the resemblance

853
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:17,500
the closeness of off the target distribution by impure future musical divergence and you kind

854
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:23,930
of did them is a which is so called lying chemicals and which is point

855
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:29,840
disease which is so determined in this paper Poland also prepared by ruled on that

856
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:36,240
topic him Mr. Christopher you which appeared this year on and also applied to the

857
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,670
probability were all this of course is described and this just to show you a

858
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:47,300
nice picture so that we we want to see that promises distribution so yeah it's

859
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:53,820
a distribution which is in dimension through where we chose a very complex is Quebec

860
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:59,040
and this is this is this is a distribution constructed from Britain functioning in

861
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:05,540
which is used in from money optimization which is that India to function because it's

862
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:10,910
a it's a kind of at the end of the story of a reasonable fee

863
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:14,320
to and museumgoers and called extremely fast

864
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:18,610
so I guess I would just as keeps so what as a result is completely

865
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,150
center with the results of would be approved as the paper that appeared

866
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,800
I think it's interesting that it appeared in Kosovo

867
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:33,580
perhaps it last year but gravel in generated by and member so we would let

868
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:41,370
proved is that under certain assumptions I didn't describe this type of adaptive algorithms that

869
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:46,980
converges so you get established the wallflower numbers

870
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:53,280
under conditions which doesn't implies a convergence of parameters for decades so that condition of

871
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,320
costs for the type of with described we to which is important that every couple

872
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:04,260
and GMC with Mr. passing approximation with decreasing stateside

873
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:09,870
so you have conditions on the gamut gave that to be so 1st can't will

874
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:17,470
not number and then can prove also said John Maturin sort of thing week environs

875
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:24,080
principle to be more precise because in the like to get to his senses that

876
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,950
the virus appearing in this

877
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:33,170
is violence which is which would have been obtained using optimal chores of the parliament

878
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:41,210
and stop a centerpiece of his adaptation calls so that its conditions for an end

879
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:49,390
to the conclusion work at of Ishtar 3rd existed brief presentation of his 2 2

880
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:53,760
2 2 Susan various so seriously

881
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,670
since the of

882
00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:01,370
there is a kind of a new type of intimacy and sentiment of commodities Minnesota

883
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:08,630
would be sufficient to students in that incident statistics in computing

884
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,060
as in November

885
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:15,210
uh and the IDB idols is methods is to try to make a poison which

886
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:20,720
it says June according to the bus simulation shows that this is the way of

887
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:26,060
it that no other way to try to save Tuan and this is this is

888
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,930
the high the high order thing i'm trying to get across is that that we

889
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:34,010
start assuming that there is independent of various pieces and once we made those assumptions

890
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,690
we can say let's quick learning to those components

891
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:41,270
OK by observing enough times in estimating the parameters

892
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,460
and the the bounds for doing that depend on the number of parameters not on

893
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,000
actual size the state space

894
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,520
that's not a robot

895
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:57,390
sorry does just that was motivational shot area so this is again this is being

896
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:01,010
tracked by an overhead camera the robot is trying to get to

897
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:03,250
the goal position which is the corner here

898
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,770
and obama by

899
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:09,420
OK hasn't learned much yet the bonobo released we

900
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:14,560
plotted the motion of it's very brownian actually moves really very very nicely

901
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:17,840
it's almost markov i mean it really seems markov

902
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:23,060
which is pretty cool considering that is just the bubble

903
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:28,500
and we want to learning trials we actually really implemented some standards

904
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:32,600
rl simulator simulations but we did them with the actual robot simulator

905
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:38,180
right and so

906
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:40,800
there it is the robot heading for

907
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:45,970
the goal here goes to the goal position can success

908
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:47,360
notice anything interesting

909
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:50,040
it doesn't know word spaces

910
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,850
it's all the positional information comes from the overhead camera even though the there's a

911
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:59,230
camera the of its nose weren't not using that for any state information it's trying

912
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:02,650
to move in whatever we get to the goal fastest because it's sort of watching

913
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:06,220
itself as an out-of-body experience and

914
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:09,720
it does it it turned out that because of the way it was programmed the

915
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,750
backward walking was slightly faster and so the learning algorithm figure that out

916
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,270
we use backward walking this is that this is an unfortunate trial where the bonobo

917
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:18,930
are kind of

918
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:22,260
part itself in the way

919
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:24,430
so the robot

920
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:29,040
it has a policy which maps all positions and orientations to where it should go

921
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:34,550
and these low probability events keep happening

922
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,400
to get out of my friends

923
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:44,350
i think this is more or less what robot frustration might look like

924
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:55,770
that point you start checking for is really random is it really really doesn't seem

925
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:58,150
any many more

926
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:02,720
but eventually eventually come on you can do it

927
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,420
to do that

928
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,380
o o o also left

929
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,110
she squeezing there before the ball gets in the way

930
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,400
and there we are so

931
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,880
the reason this was so that was like trial fifteen or something like that is

932
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,060
that the reason was able to learn such a small number of trials is because

933
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:24,360
it's totally took advantage of all this conditional independence to be built into the

934
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:27,750
the function approximator for the transition function

935
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,590
so that's one sort of function that you can build

936
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,060
OK i think OK so there's i think if you think we're saying like ten

937
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,810
more minutes or something like that there is something i want to speak to the

938
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,350
thing because i think i'm going

939
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:43,390
i got myself little bogged down but there's other kinds of ways you can introduce

940
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:47,430
various kinds of structure to learn things faster in the example that i just gave

941
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:51,260
the were in spite of horrible picture that you there was no independent of the

942
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:56,760
state on how things are going to change

943
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,800
which makes sense it's history there must be some influence but but let's say that

944
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,420
there's another way to think about it is every individual state has an influence that's

945
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:08,340
back to the original model well what if there's different types of states and within

946
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:12,780
each type there's a mapping to how things are gonna change but this but this

947
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,440
is a separate types can be learned separately so

948
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:20,190
we stood model that have been published in the important learning literature for doing that

949
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:24,400
with mdps kind of factorizing the MDP into these types

950
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,840
and we took advantage of it we able to learn

951
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,890
a great world a lot faster

952
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,670
the right hand generalizations speeds things up we do the same thing on on a

953
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:37,720
robot examples here this one is actually being tracked using

954
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,970
motion tracker things little silver balls

955
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:43,980
and it's trying to get to this white box you might not be able to

956
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:47,220
see in the corner here and we told that

957
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:52,900
different color regions may have different dynamics so learns a separate action model for what

958
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,800
all all sections do on the sandbag

959
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:58,560
the first is on the black painted wood

960
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:01,260
and the result of that is actually is able to take advantage of this in

961
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,180
a substantial way that if we if we if we ignore those distinction certainly if

962
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,420
we learn each individual place in the world map that too

963
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:11,180
an action model to to take forever to learn if we take the whole world

964
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:14,140
to say no it's really just one big space and just learn the same action

965
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,390
model for the whole space that doesn't work well either because the sand is actually

966
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:20,220
a little bit slipping and so it tends to do is it it tries to

967
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:24,260
point itself to the goal while in the sand and often overshoots and then falls

968
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,760
out of the world and it's minus one so

969
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,590
being able to condition on these two tight ends up learning more accurate model but

970
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,360
still very very quickly

971
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,640
we do something similar

972
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:38,560
the question who did this for almost all of her time trying to find a

973
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,560
different surfaces

974
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,390
it turns out that it's really easy to find the surface that the robot can

975
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:46,040
if you're a statistical learning

976
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,500
theorist i guess you might consider this

977
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,130
form to be user friendly

978
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,350
but i think probably you degree

979
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:55,380
and most practitioners would agree that

980
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,290
it just looks like a split symbols so we now have to do is to

981
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:04,240
turn that into something that means something to a practitioner so going to turn that

982
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:06,650
formula into if you like the result

983
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,710
the way to do that is is you mention

984
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:17,710
i mean it's it's really just interpreting what that formula says that in words that

985
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:22,650
in a way that is understandable what this formula is saying is OK this is

986
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:28,020
the probability of messing up the that means that with probability one minus delta

987
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,400
we want to mess up

988
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,490
right things will be OK

989
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:37,250
what does things OK mean things OK means that if we actually observe zero training

990
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:41,830
then the true error is going to be actually less than or equal to this

991
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:46,150
and that's exactly the

992
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:47,750
the bound we want

993
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:51,540
i want to be able to infer something about the generalisation error of the function

994
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:54,020
that we've chosen which is the one with zero

995
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,330
training so that's exactly how we get that

996
00:58:57,350 --> 00:59:00,600
and this is the about you can see again

997
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:05,220
with probability you know you choose anything you choose q and then with probability at

998
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:09,600
least one minus delta over the random m samples the generalisation error of the function

999
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,440
fn with zero training error is bounded by

1000
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:17,610
rfn is less or equal to and i've just written a slightly differently in that

1001
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:20,930
i've split the log onto qn times delta

1002
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:24,760
the log the product is the sum of the log so it's log one qn

1003
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,330
plus log one delta

1004
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,250
and you're already looking at

1005
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,320
you know

1006
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,210
i will result in

1007
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:32,700
statistical learning theory

1008
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:38,690
so i i mean hopefully i can

1009
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,500
you know sort of

1010
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,510
you know if you're

1011
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:47,130
we already in this implicit the sort of structure of many of the results of

1012
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:50,590
statistical learning theory very typically you're going to have the

1013
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:55,050
one and so clearly that's a very nice property that the

1014
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,510
o thing is scaling

1015
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,230
inversely with the sample size

1016
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:04,010
you've got a log one on delta now that's very nice because the delta

1017
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:09,310
confidence parameter is coming in very benignly under log

1018
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,550
so even if you sort of

1019
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,740
double the

1020
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,220
confidence you're only going to make one and the difference in the whole sorry marked

1021
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:24,980
by the conference by doing like one and difference in the bound again

1022
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,960
and then you have this to

1023
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,090
which is i'm going to start to think of

1024
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:32,260
as the complexity term

1025
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,590
in a sense it varies according to the function

1026
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,830
qn remember was chosen for a particular fan

1027
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,750
and you can think of it is somehow the complexity of the function fn

1028
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,600
in this particular training scenario

1029
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:54,890
and that's what i say on the top of the line here we can think

1030
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:59,190
of the term log one qn is the complexity description length of the function fn

1031
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:02,360
so if we manage to get a good training error

1032
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:05,680
low training error with a simple function then we get an even better bound on

1033
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:11,110
generalisation if we have to use the rather complicated function OK we get worse

1034
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:16,170
now that we have to put a prior weight on the functions that was that

1035
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,870
distribution q

1036
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,960
if the functions are drawn at random according to distribution p m

1037
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:26,630
the expected generalisation will be minimal if we actually shows that prior to be equal

1038
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:32,230
to the site which is due to be equal to the prior

1039
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:36,480
and if it's we choose it differently we actually the expected sort of loss is

1040
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,300
the KL divergence but so this is actually the starting point for the PAC bayes

1041
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,150
analysis what this

1042
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:48,500
sort of simple theorem leads through to the so PAC bayes approach

1043
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:52,070
so i'm not going to go any more into that at this point as i

1044
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:55,420
say leave it will be picking up on the PAC bayes

1045
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:01,980
in his talks in the second part of any questions on that

1046
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:08,980
q was p in this case was an assume prior is the kind of thing

1047
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:11,770
bayesians do they assume that there's

1048
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,870
you are actually

1049
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:20,470
the the likelihood of certain one of those functions arising in a particular application

1050
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,650
it is known beforehand

1051
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:31,750
i know this is this is the a distribution over functions this is the distribution

1052
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,200
over the

1053
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,580
so this is the assumption that they know that the likelihood of this function arising

1054
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,340
in a particular application is

1055
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,540
you know

1056
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:45,180
i don't know enough about it to know what is free

1057
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,290
to be clear

1058
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,030
when it is there for

1059
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:53,240
latest data only that people talk about certainly get discussed the problem of dark energy

1060
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:57,210
what it is is the expansion of the universe actually accelerating or not

1061
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:58,650
in the area

1062
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:05,750
it because with a real puzzle or not time to leave that is

1063
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:09,790
for example are the idea is now

1064
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:13,140
that's in addition we've talked about so far

1065
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:15,370
there's one for some

1066
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:17,800
the mathematics of the standard model

1067
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,130
it's just not be there

1068
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,350
we met

1069
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,800
the electrons electrons and quarks

1070
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:27,670
we have met

1071
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:36,430
w z will be forced the fundamental particles of matter all fermions spin

1072
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:41,110
four carries of those spin one

1073
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:45,620
why is the force has been one matter particles with

1074
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:47,050
could you imagine

1075
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,910
this image

1076
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,200
there are also

1077
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:52,770
spin-off of terrorism spin one

1078
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:56,850
so this is the idea of supersymmetry

1079
01:03:56,870 --> 01:04:00,450
which is that to every variety of

1080
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,100
that we know

1081
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:05,370
there is a supersymmetric partner

1082
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:07,700
with which is about

1083
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,580
and the idea was that we know

1084
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:13,900
there's supersymmetric partners in the firm

1085
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:19,360
and what you need to know what are the names of these things so

1086
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:24,840
convention is that the supersymmetric models for

1087
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:28,370
you take the first name with s from

1088
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:32,410
so the semantic while becomes squall

1089
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:33,770
this is not true

1090
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:37,070
concentrate this select support here it is

1091
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,900
would all the time

1092
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,960
she was

1093
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:48,210
are real and so put in afterwards

1094
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:52,590
so in supersymmetry photons the folk scene the movie

1095
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:53,900
that's what we know

1096
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,000
the why

1097
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:02,770
now i want to know is that supersymmetry cannot be exact

1098
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:10,220
the masses of supersymmetric particles would be identical to the convention

1099
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:14,720
and if that's the case we wouldn't be here is we are here is because

1100
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:18,240
the light is electrically charged particle

1101
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:25,540
this debate has exclusion principle which says you can't go to the same quantum state

1102
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:28,500
that particular reason why there structure

1103
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:30,750
in the atomic elements in the periodic table

1104
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,600
four which gives rise to

1105
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:34,320
real stuff like us

1106
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:38,410
if the light is charged particles have been imposed on

1107
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:39,800
there would be no

1108
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:44,290
both songs sort of like penguins millenarian

1109
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,680
and by the late so

1110
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:50,250
challenges that you get horrible horror movie

1111
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,330
we have no idea

1112
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:56,660
b so the fact that supersymmetry is broken

1113
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:57,680
i mean this is

1114
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,120
particles must be much more massive

1115
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:04,650
the ones which is again a very fortunate to be here

1116
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:08,640
so there are two possibilities one is

1117
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:10,490
this idea is complete

1118
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:13,630
there actually are in such

1119
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:17,590
that supersymmetry is part of nature's

1120
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:21,220
and that it also has been broken by mass

1121
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,740
the semantic particles are at

1122
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:29,000
the energy scale at the LHC will change why do i say that the energy

1123
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:32,620
energy scale because

1124
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:40,250
for which i can't you hear this more detailed quantitative shown that what is it

1125
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:45,130
estimate altogether but using the semantic information you have about ads on pages in collaborative

1126
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:48,940
filtering that is so missing people assume

1127
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:56,980
but this is again not trivial salangi

1128
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:00,760
the other thing that can be done is by using something like biclustering

1129
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:05,440
so you have the feature in the new cluster query and ad space

1130
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:11,110
then in the contribution that comes from the residual space depends on which cluster the

1131
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,940
query belongs to an which cluster that belong to several clusters going to have its

1132
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:19,840
own contribution so this is what say this is how you avoid the curse of

1133
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:25,780
dimensionality cluster the queries cluster that and then for every block in the

1134
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,800
in the two dimensional clusters you had

1135
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:34,940
you have contribution and so this has been done it was so this also works

1136
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:40,300
so there is hope i think since the this model was that what works i

1137
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:43,530
don't see any reason why the first one will not work but again it hasn't

1138
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:44,940
been tried

1139
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:49,610
OK so

1140
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:56,610
let me end with some challenges so you know so we have seen so we

1141
01:07:56,610 --> 01:08:02,130
saw some case studies we began with some challenges that arise when estimating click-through rates

1142
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:05,050
we saw some case studies and then we also saw some

1143
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:10,130
open problems in some approaches one could use to solve those open problems but let

1144
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:14,000
me end by again

1145
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:14,840
you know

1146
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:21,150
mentioning some of the other challenges which we might actually lead to fruitful research a

1147
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:23,230
feature so

1148
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:29,190
so these are some of the challenges summarised again we already talked about that so

1149
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:32,230
you know if you just use the information retrieval approach it will miss the context

1150
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:37,690
in many cases and that can be compensated by using click as as a feedback

1151
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:40,420
mechanism but you know once you

1152
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,780
once you start estimating CTR using click feedback

1153
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:44,940
you know

1154
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,840
you have to worry about introducing features that will granular you have to worry about

1155
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:53,610
sparsity have to worry about bias issues you have to worry the body about dynamics

1156
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:56,030
you have to worry about training cost

1157
01:08:56,050 --> 01:09:00,110
know how long if you cover the model take seven days to

1158
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:02,130
train them that's not

1159
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:06,460
that's not a very attractive proposition so you want to model to be trained quickly

1160
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,840
and you can come of it models where the prediction

1161
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,190
it takes a long time

1162
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:13,280
be computed because

1163
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:17,400
when you add in an online setting you get equity you have to evaluate the

1164
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,190
whole bunch of ads before deciding which one to put their so if the

1165
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:25,940
prediction function is very expensive to compute you will never meet the latency requirement requested

1166
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:30,440
that is again another constraint important constraints which one has to keep in mind when

1167
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:34,030
the when coming up so you can't do something which is done in netflix competition

1168
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:38,360
for instance coming over two hundred projects and melting them all together that is fine

1169
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:42,030
to win the competition was not going to work in the system

1170
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:45,130
because it's just too expensive to compute that you have to compute that function for

1171
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:47,570
maybe ten thousand to select the top k

1172
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:50,340
because you don't have the time you have like forty or fifty milliseconds to do

1173
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,920
that you can't do that

1174
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,380
so so that's another constraint to keep in mind you need to more com you

1175
01:09:55,380 --> 01:10:01,190
need compact models that accurate that can be computed very quickly trying to

1176
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,460
so again we

1177
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:06,360
some other methods which have not been tried but

1178
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:08,070
might be useful to try to like

1179
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:11,730
in know boosting your decision trees all these methods are all fine but again the

1180
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:17,350
the my name is and you could for a faculty member here at the center

1181
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:22,250
for language and speech processing have one the commute to this day event in the

1182
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:26,290
two week event and for some of you another six weeks after that the first

1183
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:30,530
a quick round of king of my introductions how many of you have the macro

1184
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:35,390
students i know there should be about of your hands the mako sponsoring your with

1185
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:36,550
here this is

1186
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:42,300
is that these are the people sponsored by the north american association for the

1187
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:48,000
for computational linguistics OK so there may be some of missing then because i see

1188
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,700
one two three four five six hand

1189
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:53,200
OK maybe there are more if you

1190
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:58,960
OK OK so there one group of you who are here only for two weeks

1191
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,250
they are supported by sponsored by this organisation

1192
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:05,080
which most of you hopefully know about but if you don't you can find out

1193
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:09,570
and that the rest of you out here thanks to NSF and you're going be

1194
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:12,640
here for the long haul not just these two weeks but another six weeks after

1195
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,750
that so

1196
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,920
a little bit about the summer workshops these started back in ninety three

1197
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:23,760
and the summer workshops model after some things that people are doing in mathematics at

1198
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,890
the institute for defense analyses in intrinsic

1199
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,430
this is the kind of this is that if you have any of these books

1200
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:33,290
this is from the legend of all these code breakers we used to sit in

1201
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:35,110
these classified

1202
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:39,450
i secret lab could work and so they started off with that and the idea

1203
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:42,120
was you get a bunch of smart people locked them up in a place for

1204
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:46,890
the summer and the problem solving and go about working on it for six eight

1205
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:52,000
weeks and this was happening in mathematics and they were called scanned sense can stand

1206
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,980
for something i'm never going back and a summer camp for advanced mathematics something

1207
01:11:58,010 --> 01:11:59,560
so anyway so

1208
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:04,890
people who are working on speech and language technology that we have some hard problems

1209
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:08,840
and these people have been working on for ten fifteen years nobody is able to

1210
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:12,400
solve then why don't we try to scam by david about a bunch of people

1211
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,640
locked them up in some places and see if they can solve the problem

1212
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:19,480
and that's when it started in ninety three and in fact the first two summer

1213
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:25,290
workshops held at rutgers and ninety five these workshops came over the johns hopkins because

1214
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:30,220
at that time the center for language and speech processing had been established here and

1215
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:33,230
the essentially said hey we can do a better job hosting them in the UK

1216
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:36,740
will give you try and for the given to us in this period since then

1217
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,790
for the last fifteen plus years

1218
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,760
and so the main idea is that in six weeks we get a lot of

1219
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,260
very good researchers from all over the world to work on problems in speech and

1220
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:49,610
so as with a lot of these enterprises they need money so we have to

1221
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:54,140
raise money for these workshops are typically the defense department gives us some money but

1222
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:57,270
then we went to NSF and said hey why don't you get some money to

1223
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:01,140
and this will give you money if you have some students in there

1224
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:04,670
it OK students are good be therapy very good grad students that's nice to do

1225
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:07,380
some good work in fact most of the really research in the world gets done

1226
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:09,770
by grad student and that

1227
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:12,080
none the of women undergraduate

1228
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,050
what do we do with undergraduate

1229
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:18,980
and then of course you very happy with the pool we got we got some

1230
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:23,100
really superstar people the only problem with the people they know anything about speech and

1231
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:29,860
language they were doing the kind of whatever electrical engineering computer science psychology statistics

1232
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:32,970
and we said have you heard about passing the like

1233
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:37,290
four that have heard of all n grams no we know about speech i mean

1234
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:40,090
the way you and i don't know how well the speech signal have you heard

1235
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:43,880
about spectral characteristics evolve no

1236
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:47,570
OK we have a problem so we decided to get the students to come to

1237
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:51,730
weeks earlier and in two two weeks for the common where we can about speech

1238
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:55,170
and language into their heads so that for the next six weeks and they can

1239
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:58,790
be on par with the rest of the researchers and do good research and that's

1240
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:03,260
really the origin of these two weeks workshop two-week summer schools the idea was to

1241
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:07,130
get these undergraduate usually everything we know in two weeks essentially to a dump of

1242
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:09,950
everything you know and then for the next six weeks there will be on part

1243
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:12,720
of the reason said well

1244
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:16,290
it turned out that the idea was more successful than we thought and more and

1245
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:19,950
more students started saying hey you want come to come to an then organisations like

1246
01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:23,790
next step and said we pay for the students to come to recover the travel

1247
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:27,770
and housing you OK alright so it's grown and grown in now to become what

1248
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:30,630
it is and so every summer for two weeks we have a lot of fun

1249
01:14:30,990 --> 01:14:34,720
we created two-week program and just in case you haven't thought about it if we

1250
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:38,740
add up it's about four and half five credits worth of study that you're doing

1251
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:41,370
these two weeks so if you're in school and if you initiated the number of

1252
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:45,770
lecture and lab hours that course in half perhaps at the graduate level for undergraduate

1253
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:47,650
taking two courses in two weeks

1254
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:49,190
so be

1255
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:51,230
there's a lot of information coming at you

1256
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:54,190
i don't know if you've heard the expression drinking from a fire hose but that's

1257
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:58,360
what you've been doing for the next two we have one and the way they

1258
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,850
are going to be structured is going to be a lecture two lectures in the

1259
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:04,600
morning typically in love in the afternoon lectures at all her money

1260
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:08,670
and the lab the outgoing chief when tried to over one quick thing about the

1261
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:12,420
last today do go to the lab early because nearly you need to get to

1262
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:16,380
compute accounts which reminds me the second part of my little five you should be

1263
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:19,680
looking to be administrator so all of you here got to know you need to

1264
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:23,730
know a couple of very important people and i'm not one of them for his

1265
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:24,440
money que

1266
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:27,670
hopefully one help was not make money can

1267
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:32,420
OK after me to write very important otherwise you want function in place that get

1268
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:36,030
money communication assistant called is added to the set on the third floor of the

1269
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:40,490
building money because the centre administrator there is the interesting and they essentially run the

1270
01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:43,200
place for your anything like and if you come to me and you have a

1271
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,850
problem as as all the money for i do

1272
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,370
that's how it works

1273
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:53,470
so up to taking the minimum second you have to get to know systems administrator

1274
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:57,290
justin martin he be began the afternoon in the lab and who help you set

1275
01:15:57,290 --> 01:16:02,040
up a computer account and every new computer account is like a new relationship to

1276
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:05,490
figure out what the other person like and how it works and what happened in

1277
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:10,230
one thousand so basically allowed to spend refined lab this southampton getting use computers to

1278
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:13,960
do come early and there's only just and i think he may have the student

1279
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:18,530
assistant but a couple of them be going around in the of you thirty become

1280
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:22,540
while to get everybody's problem sorted out so do come early to the lab and

1281
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:28,700
changing and then you can actually bigger and bigger and and everything will be OK

1282
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,080
sometimes we want to make changes and play

1283
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,490
they do that

1284
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:38,540
say OK i don't want to search number of in

1285
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,830
so if you if have

1286
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:49,020
this guy

1287
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:53,700
we always need to show all this in the first of all we have a

1288
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:58,850
lot of of index size of collection and they do so action in all of

1289
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:05,450
them and then that result from the search

1290
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:16,290
OK so if you have a smaller index new version of all documents

1291
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:21,700
it's extremely easy you can you can look into source code different search engine so

1292
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:26,760
what we have is that says from from the biggest index

1293
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,370
and you remember that we always have

1294
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:34,140
and so are the least of document idea

1295
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:36,450
then the area

1296
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:38,180
following index

1297
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,560
and what we can do it again

1298
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:45,160
if you have a new so for example if we have edit war in the

1299
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,540
next olympics

1300
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,580
this implies have foreseen

1301
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,770
if for example

1302
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:56,740
we had work begun one bigger

1303
01:17:56,770 --> 01:18:02,720
so it didn't have no national document so in the end they don't hesitate to

1304
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:05,560
get it from this index

1305
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:06,890
to handle the

1306
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:10,510
patient handling delicate over from from documents

1307
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:12,410
then it's going to happen

1308
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:15,430
least of all documents in every index

1309
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:18,120
simply a list of football idea

1310
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,930
and during this and that's something you need to remove

1311
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:26,060
ideas of documents from all units during marriage

1312
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:30,290
if you see the document actually in this in this but not in the old

1313
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:42,890
OK so why the

1314
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:46,410
talk so much about compression of

1315
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:50,240
if you have these

1316
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:53,330
if you have a list of all document idea

1317
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:55,120
based on what

1318
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,620
i have talked about

1319
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,810
compression of integers

1320
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:01,600
this leads

1321
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:06,540
it will become pressed extremely well i can assure you that if you one two

1322
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:08,140
percent of all

1323
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:10,350
my maybe less

1324
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:12,620
because it we have a lot of

1325
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:17,040
close into and we can use an approach that we have

1326
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,100
and we can compress the extremely extremely well

1327
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,600
so it's not a problem at all

1328
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:27,540
the problem the problem here is going be only performed during

1329
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:31,240
of course there some performance because doing this

1330
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:32,560
this is now

1331
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:38,180
but again you can search for literature and you can see that you do that

1332
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:40,390
you can prove actually that

1333
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:43,680
degradation of

1334
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,970
is what is

1335
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:54,950
it's not so bad at the same time the speed is now so see if

1336
01:19:54,950 --> 01:20:00,220
it if you want to find some combination between the evidence search

1337
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:04,910
this is near optimal

1338
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:09,430
now we are talking about another approach

1339
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:11,990
so we want we don't want to

1340
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:17,540
reviewed index or using some sort of for example we are concerned about how to

1341
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:21,080
search in the number of units in parallel how to

1342
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,850
pratt said big number five days

1343
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:30,030
so it's in place traditional so we're trying to keep all index always

1344
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:35,180
we are making changes in our index

1345
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,740
and there are a lot of ways how we can do this

1346
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:42,950
but i want to discuss only one approach and this is approach is how to

1347
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:47,270
create an inverted index in but

1348
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:50,930
we discussed the material in the second lecture

1349
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:54,720
and this is very well known structure

1350
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:58,680
this is a classical structure and here you can find

1351
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:07,030
millions of way i believe not maybe thousands of wafers about optimisation implementation and so

1352
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:14,490
there are many there are a lot of good implementations of a structure

1353
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:19,220
because of this you know that

1354
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:23,370
but really is perfect when you are limited in memory

1355
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:27,740
because always working with these blocks is limited size

1356
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:31,200
if you are limited to is random access memory

1357
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:34,040
also we can

1358
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:39,030
create in place update about inverted index using battery

1359
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,680
so how we can do

1360
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:44,390
remember from the second lecture so in every

1361
01:21:44,410 --> 01:21:45,970
so a lot of help

1362
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:49,310
of the three they have some key

1363
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:53,870
and we can also always attach some data for the key so

1364
01:21:53,870 --> 01:21:57,740
what we need to do we need to create this tree slot that we're going

1365
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:00,200
to to put into the streets

1366
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:05,470
and this is what is pretty obviously can

1367
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:06,930
forty four

1368
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:11,160
and block of course lists of some part of course list

1369
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:16,470
last i don't know class

1370
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:21,510
again two hundred fifty five i of documents already compressed

1371
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:25,510
and this is one element of the history and the building of tree based on

1372
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:32,040
how we can compare so we remember that always we need to

1373
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:36,810
to have some or all of this because it's sorted arrays that are in tree

1374
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:39,030
and we need to put them in order

1375
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:43,060
so we can what they can do they can come work if words equal we

1376
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:44,810
can compare fields

1377
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:47,540
the idea of document in this post LI

1378
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,160
and that's

1379
01:22:55,370 --> 01:23:01,350
features because i'm talking about change so the idea is very simple

1380
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:05,970
they have arbitrary on in every slaughter of history you can look on in your

1381
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:09,740
books into my slides from the second lecture

1382
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:13,530
they're putting forward and they're putting part of course list

1383
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:21,240
of course you can say that sometimes put full on both these deputy warden many

1384
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:27,410
but at the same time as i said usually far smaller than possibly is now

1385
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:31,680
part of course this and also they can compress it using preface compression

1386
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:36,240
so it's very naive implementation and

1387
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:39,740
for example open source search and research

1388
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:45,270
two key that they're using this implementation of inverted index

1389
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:51,410
and it's pretty fast in case of limited memory but how we can update this

1390
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:53,490
let's start with the

1391
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:58,180
that's what we can do we can create it from scratch if you have pretty

1392
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:00,430
good collection don't have indexed

1393
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:02,200
and i want to

1394
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:04,430
prove that we can create a

1395
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:07,120
the tree for this index this

1396
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:09,720
slots as fast as

1397
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,290
recreated inverted index

1398
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:14,510
the approach is very simple

1399
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:19,080
so we are getting our down because he is regarded as the had it

1400
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,810
four inverted index

1401
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:25,740
and the creating of slot and simply trying to put them into a

1402
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:29,430
but that's usually messy and not only going to talk about that

1403
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:31,420
so you might want to

1404
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,260
we look at some of channel to colour something talk

1405
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:36,430
go through it in detail

1406
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,960
but it turns out that quite often just going for the motive distribution can be

1407
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,870
a good idea

1408
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:46,020
always but in many cases it's good enough

1409
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:48,650
we've looked at two very popular

1410
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:49,850
got some prior

1411
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:52,470
the conjugate prior

1412
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:56,220
that surprised visitors just will fly around this more than five

1413
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:58,280
because prior was like

1414
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,570
well the just

1415
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:03,150
similar trend of mixed and often added to it

1416
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:06,590
and which is sort of problem

1417
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:10,940
and the really important thing is these are all convex problems

1418
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:13,220
and there are lots of ways how you can end up with a non convex

1419
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:18,900
we might touch upon something later on

1420
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:20,540
but this least

1421
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:23,210
is all fairly nice

1422
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:27,760
any questions now

1423
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:31,010
a want of one

1424
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:33,520
so the graphical models

1425
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:36,760
so what do is result briefly refresh

1426
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:40,090
what salmon martin did last week

1427
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:43,810
well talk about conditional independence happens at people decomposition

1428
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:47,140
message passing and dynamic programming

1429
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:50,460
so this is all familiar to you just relax

1430
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:53,020
taken as

1431
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:56,330
conditional independence well

1432
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:57,920
six next prime

1433
01:25:58,050 --> 01:25:59,700
conditionally independent

1434
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:01,220
given c

1435
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:04,230
if the joint probability of x x prime given c

1436
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:11,370
nice simple example would be

1437
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:15,030
it's about the x

1438
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:18,560
this is the probability that i'll be carrying an umbrella

1439
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:22,370
defectors from the probably the matter will carry numbers

1440
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,410
and i usually don't talk to each other before

1441
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:29,030
to decide whether we will carry an umbrella

1442
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:32,480
bottles might look out the window

1443
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:33,350
we look at

1444
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:36,220
civil there's some plants so

1445
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:39,860
therefore it's probably a good idea to bring for

1446
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,810
so c

1447
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:43,010
within the files

1448
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,870
or the absence thereof

1449
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:49,770
and so therefore well the probability that that i will be an umbrella will be

1450
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:52,020
highly correlated

1451
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:57,820
this this and that and

1452
01:26:57,850 --> 01:27:06,270
but a well given scene in the clouds those events independent

1453
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:10,800
i could go and model the overall probability of each clustering and related the same

1454
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:16,750
and this really complicated distribution in that we may be eighty nine people in the

1455
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:18,780
so it

1456
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:20,370
the distribution over

1457
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:24,920
two to the a two dimensional state really wanted to store all those coefficients well

1458
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,740
there's no computer that could do it

1459
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:29,440
at least not at the moment

1460
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:30,930
but i could go

1461
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:32,290
and model

1462
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:35,570
each individual probability fairly efficiently

1463
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:39,480
i could for instance what you for a couple of days and see whether bring

1464
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:41,450
an umbrella or not

1465
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:43,230
people a good model for

1466
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:48,140
and and then something that you don't talk to each other before but they will

1467
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:49,740
bring an umbrella or not

1468
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:51,750
this will give a good estimate

1469
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:55,320
of the overall probability of people bring an umbrella

1470
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:59,810
OK so that's conditional independence

1471
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:02,590
and this is really what would allow u

1472
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:05,530
to estimate the distribution of umbrellas

1473
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:06,760
very easily

1474
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:07,910
even so

1475
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:13,750
if you don't use any of this factorisation knowledge will be nearly impossible problem

1476
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:16,660
now obviously

1477
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:20,230
function that generalizes

1478
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:22,160
so given some graphs

1479
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:24,410
some vertices v and edges e

1480
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:28,170
we associate a random variable x with every

1481
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,530
vertex on the graph

1482
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,660
what you have number or not

1483
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,670
this is a vertex in the graph

1484
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:39,080
and the some might be another vertex transitive

1485
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:42,700
now subset of the random variables are conditionally independent given x

1486
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:46,110
if when removing those vertices from the graph

1487
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:49,140
the rock breaks up into disjoint subsets

1488
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:53,240
well that's really amounts fall of the definition let's look at some pictures

1489
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:57,360
that's timberlake example

1490
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:59,480
more than the other one

1491
01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:02,280
markov chain

1492
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,420
a simple example would be

1493
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:07,010
the traffic lights

1494
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:11,340
it's a traffic light and if you know the current state well

1495
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:14,860
the previous states in the future states decouple from each other

1496
01:29:14,870 --> 01:29:17,200
so you don't need to know at least

1497
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:21,110
knowing how traffic lights are what all the previous states were if you know the

1498
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:22,740
current one

1499
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:27,010
we can easily predict what's going to happen in the future

1500
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:31,330
some people think looks like that

1501
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:35,420
so that future events only determined by the president

1502
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:38,760
more generally

1503
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:40,320
graphical models

1504
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:45,490
so only talking about undirected graphical models except for small exception

1505
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:49,420
and here qualified to move those three to eight nodes

1506
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:53,490
these green blocks decompose

1507
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:56,440
so you can have a a whole bunch of random variables and they might be

1508
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:58,970
connected and really complicated ways

1509
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,290
i can model that very efficiently

1510
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:04,810
by really just dealing with those

1511
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:13,730
you probably still remember from my talk is celebrated theorem of hammersley clifford actually they

1512
01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:14,690
wrote about

1513
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:16,050
and the proof is wrong

1514
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:21,580
and they usually bizarre for proof today think like two three years later

1515
01:30:22,170 --> 01:30:28,330
to state where the first ones to write the theorem best name

1516
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:31,020
this is quite cool

1517
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:36,920
that delta

1518
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:38,930
entailed a contradiction

1519
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:43,620
which was not just of its stuff

1520
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:45,770
then there exists

1521
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:56,070
of about guy

1522
01:30:56,230 --> 01:31:03,720
from that

1523
01:31:03,730 --> 01:31:08,140
for a relation

1524
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:12,340
there exists

1525
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:19,100
the population

1526
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:22,310
of about things

1527
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:26,640
from some

1528
01:31:33,850 --> 01:31:40,720
of that

1529
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:52,260
if some delta i

1530
01:31:56,710 --> 01:31:59,940
because we can just go just make i

1531
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:01,390
big enough

1532
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:07,200
to be bigger than the subscript on anything in the finite subset

1533
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:09,920
all right by that stage of the construction

1534
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:12,140
but in this

1535
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:21,570
and here is god as being considered either included or not

1536
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:26,420
there is no such derivations

1537
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:34,890
that's what we already proved

1538
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:45,520
i guess if you really want to be

1539
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:49,910
convinced know another observation the AI

1540
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:54,570
is in delta only if

1541
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:56,860
i i is in delta

1542
01:32:56,940 --> 01:33:01,170
this again

1543
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:05,080
you can observe this day by induction on i

1544
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:10,820
that makes this to

1545
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:16,760
in fact obvious

1546
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:21,510
there's no other way that anything can get in delta rather than being thrown into

1547
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:26,930
until the later stages we considering adding something different

1548
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:30,360
and just as well

1549
01:33:30,450 --> 01:33:38,040
all right

1550
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:45,880
properties of this big set delta

1551
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:57,210
super set

1552
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:03,260
is inconsistent

1553
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:09,620
that is

1554
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:13,270
for people with a

1555
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:16,700
if a is not in doubt

1556
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,310
then delta

1557
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:20,900
together with a

1558
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:29,720
and tells the contradiction

1559
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:31,220
why is that

1560
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:34,070
well by construction

1561
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:39,940
OK gamma is a subset of delta

1562
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,320
during the construction

1563
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:48,910
it's not a five plus one

1564
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:50,890
for some i

1565
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:52,660
greater than or equal to here

1566
01:34:53,760 --> 01:35:00,880
at some point during the construction begins the the board

1567
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:05,680
if we didn't put it in delta one

1568
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:10,800
from delta i which is a subset of delta which is also a subset of

1569
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,890
delta together with it

1570
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:15,570
we can get a contradiction

1571
01:35:15,570 --> 01:35:18,440
so if we get a contradiction from a subset of delta

1572
01:35:19,710 --> 01:35:26,820
together with with with the time one and also the derivation from old

1573
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:31,850
so delta is not only consistent

1574
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,810
does consistent

1575
01:35:34,830 --> 01:35:38,630
this is because it could get without going in consists

1576
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:41,960
which one more formula into it

1577
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:49,820
even if his wife fifteen you can't put it without delta explodes

1578
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:52,540
and then to everything

1579
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:56,560
putting those two properties together

1580
01:35:56,570 --> 01:36:01,070
delta is what we call the maximal

1581
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:04,900
on system

1582
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:25,280
now the enumeration to be absolutely anything enumerations just

1583
01:36:25,330 --> 01:36:31,800
just which formally number one number two number three or four

1584
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:37,510
what we have established

1585
01:36:38,490 --> 01:36:42,320
in fact every

1586
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:48,270
so set

1587
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:55,830
a maximal consistent

1588
01:36:55,830 --> 01:37:01,330
that it's a proxy for data compression transforms the data throwaways little guys transmit the

1589
01:37:01,330 --> 01:37:02,420
big eyes

1590
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:05,490
the receiver invert transform and i

1591
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:06,950
let's see what i guess

1592
01:37:06,990 --> 01:37:08,880
so if you do this

1593
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:12,470
you get the picture that looks like this is this projection is not

1594
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,210
but what you see that there is very little difference between these two pictures and

1595
01:37:17,210 --> 01:37:19,720
what showing you the data compression

1596
01:37:22,990 --> 01:37:27,520
so you can store away ninety seven point five percent of the

1597
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:32,580
wavelet coefficients and no do not suffer the perceptron loss and what i'm telling you

1598
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:37,580
data compression kind of works to mathematically what we've done is we've had this blue

1599
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:42,910
vector of wavelet coefficients we set to zero in red almost all of the chapter

1600
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:44,400
largest one

1601
01:37:44,410 --> 01:37:51,570
and so we truncated expansion to only retains the expansion the s largest coefficients

1602
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:53,240
OK so that's far

1603
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:56,860
and the fact is that images that we care about

1604
01:37:56,890 --> 01:38:01,570
very often are sparse in a convenient representation

1605
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,690
OK so sparsity has had an enormous impact on people's thinking it's

1606
01:38:07,070 --> 01:38:11,650
link to play the fundamental role in the late twentieth century in how we can

1607
01:38:11,650 --> 01:38:14,720
estimate things how we can compress

1608
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:18,960
it's almost a tautology how when and how well we can model

1609
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:23,190
things with a few parameters and so on and so forth but today i would

1610
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:27,770
like to discuss another implication of sparsity which is the sparsity has bearings on the

1611
01:38:27,770 --> 01:38:33,090
data acquisition process itself and as we will see its sparsity determines how quickly i

1612
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:36,940
can acquire signals in the non adaptive fashion

1613
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:42,680
so the the the first premise underlying compressed sensing its sparsity the second is incoherent

1614
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,270
which is

1615
01:38:44,290 --> 01:38:47,490
the topic we have not explored yet

1616
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:50,840
so let me explain what this is you'll see it's very very simple

1617
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:52,530
we have

1618
01:38:52,540 --> 01:38:56,070
signal that we wish to acquire that has a sparse expansion

1619
01:38:56,090 --> 01:38:58,930
in the basis site

1620
01:38:58,990 --> 01:39:03,390
so now we have two systems we have the systems in which this object is

1621
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:04,410
assumed to be spas

1622
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:07,790
and then we have the system that we wish to sense

1623
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:10,200
the object which i denote by phi k

1624
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,720
so for example if we do radiology

1625
01:39:12,730 --> 01:39:17,920
if i k because i do m would be sinusoids and then signed for example

1626
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,530
the thing is sparse in the wavelet domain for example

1627
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:25,010
if we do or angiography where most of the images black and only a few

1628
01:39:25,010 --> 01:39:28,680
pixels indicating blood flows along vessels

1629
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,800
are actually not zero

1630
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:33,900
it could actually be the canonical basis

1631
01:39:33,910 --> 01:39:38,240
OK so now we have two systems the sparse the system in which things are

1632
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:40,820
assumed to be spas or nearly so far

1633
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:44,820
and then the systems in which an sensing objects

1634
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:49,220
and now we can define a coherence between these two systems

1635
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:51,130
phi and psi

1636
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:54,880
which is a very simple notion so i'm going to assume that the basis functions

1637
01:39:54,880 --> 01:40:01,570
are normalized to sparsity waveforms and sensing waveforms are normalised so the unit vectors

1638
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:05,050
and we're going to do is we're going to introduce the coherence spaces between the

1639
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:10,750
basis phi and the basic as follows is essentially is the dimension of the signal

1640
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,480
times the maximum

1641
01:40:12,490 --> 01:40:21,260
of the coefficients the correlation coefficients between the sensing waveforms and the sparsity waveforms

1642
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,630
OK so it's very very simple

1643
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:29,420
i'm looking at the maximum correlations between the sensing and the sparsity way from the

1644
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:36,050
squares that correlation coefficient multiplied by an and that's incoherence between the coherence between the

1645
01:40:36,050 --> 01:40:37,650
two basis for

1646
01:40:38,810 --> 01:40:41,390
now this coherence

1647
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:45,840
is always between one and because of course this is a no-brainer product between unit

1648
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:50,160
vectors is less than one and therefore the coherence is less and and

1649
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:55,470
and it will be actually maximum if for example the two bases are the same

1650
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:59,210
is the two bases are the same then this maximum inner product is one and

1651
01:40:59,210 --> 01:41:02,170
so the coherence is and

1652
01:41:02,770 --> 01:41:06,740
always two busy share an element coherence and

1653
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:09,010
on the other hand its minimum

1654
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:12,060
if all of this correlation coefficients are equal

1655
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,680
two one over square would have an

1656
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:18,240
so its minimum is the coherence is equal to one it's easy to see that

1657
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:22,410
the coherence has to be greater than one because of some parts of the relationship

1658
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:24,380
which if i saw

1659
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:29,240
over j i get the energy of five which is one so one of the

1660
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:32,150
coefficients square has to be greater than one of n

1661
01:41:32,150 --> 01:41:34,770
and therefore the coherence has to be greater than one

1662
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:40,090
so the coherence is the quantity that measures the similarity between bases five days is

1663
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:44,860
side its minimum if it's equal to one and its maximum for example in the

1664
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:46,380
case was identical

1665
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:49,490
is the coherence is equal to

1666
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:54,130
so let me give you an example so for example let's say we're doing communication

1667
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:59,610
signals where we assume that we're about to see is signal that has a sparse

1668
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:05,720
frequency spectrum for example of bandlimited signal that we have discussed earlier in that case

1669
01:42:05,730 --> 01:42:07,970
the signal would be sparse in

1670
01:42:07,970 --> 01:42:09,570
another way

1671
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:15,030
without making specific assumptions about what kind of shape you're looking for but this can

1672
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:16,280
this can

1673
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:20,720
so this kind thing is very flexible way

1674
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:23,530
another thing to think that

1675
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:26,200
of things the this

1676
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:28,530
peak around

1677
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:30,930
this the late spring here

1678
01:42:31,090 --> 01:42:33,390
it's getting larger and larger

1679
01:42:33,450 --> 01:42:38,320
up until the place we have trained it actually think this is getting larger and

1680
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,410
the other one thirty percent

1681
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:45,410
we can look at the hyperparameters of the the the same computer as

1682
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:48,320
the magnitude of two point four million

1683
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:52,090
this decay time the characteristic time of the periodicity

1684
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:54,890
if but that would be about ninety years

1685
01:42:54,930 --> 01:42:56,110
we only had

1686
01:42:56,110 --> 01:43:00,360
fifty or sixty years of data i the thing that's what things look pretty periodic

1687
01:43:00,530 --> 01:43:02,760
inside the the

1688
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:07,200
the interval that we have data only

1689
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:13,360
between the very early part of the of the there very late there might be

1690
01:43:14,030 --> 01:43:20,840
things that are not exactly periodic

1691
01:43:23,390 --> 01:43:28,510
what i hope to show with this example is that

1692
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:31,180
doesn't persist are quite flexible models

1693
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:32,220
and the idea

1694
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:33,280
that you can

1695
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:36,340
what you get used to thinking about covariance functions

1696
01:43:36,430 --> 01:43:38,590
there is a nice way of

1697
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:42,990
understanding the properties of the function that you're looking at

1698
01:43:43,010 --> 01:43:45,880
in in this particular case you could actually understand the data by just putting the

1699
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:47,070
data and looking at it

1700
01:43:47,070 --> 01:43:52,140
but because the one-dimensional data all these methods can also equally well be used or

1701
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:56,610
what about my life not so easy just to look at the data and you

1702
01:43:56,610 --> 01:44:00,840
can still trying understand things in terms of the properties of the covariance function that

1703
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:01,970
maps the data well

1704
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:04,050
that's an important way

1705
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:04,970
try to get

1706
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:09,990
inside about it

1707
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:16,160
one thing we talked about a little bit about yesterday and had

1708
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:18,510
but question about this as well

1709
01:44:18,970 --> 01:44:23,780
actually doing maximisation here and i was sort of early on i was saying well

1710
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:26,300
we should be careful if you do mathematician

1711
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:32,510
that's exactly right when i i'm i'm optimizing over eleven from here should really

1712
01:44:32,570 --> 01:44:35,990
check that the result i'm guessing

1713
01:44:36,030 --> 01:44:39,510
it is a good approximation to the right

1714
01:44:41,550 --> 01:44:45,090
two of the right and the right answer would be hard to get right because

1715
01:44:45,090 --> 01:44:49,720
that would have to integrate out those eleven promise have some

1716
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:53,880
and the functional way the enter into the covariance function is very complicated

1717
01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:57,780
that would be a real challenge and analytically probably wouldn't be able to do that

1718
01:44:57,780 --> 01:45:02,880
that we have to to resort to marketing column and the producer you went back

1719
01:45:02,890 --> 01:45:05,450
i also showed on example

1720
01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:08,280
situations where

1721
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:13,090
doing maximisation with a good approximation give you almost identical predictions

1722
01:45:13,090 --> 01:45:16,180
two when you actually do things properly

1723
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:18,110
the nice paper

1724
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:21,260
about this paper called optimizer integrate out

1725
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,390
but by the car

1726
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:26,180
the interest in this issue which is an interesting issue

1727
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:31,340
then the place to start

1728
01:45:31,390 --> 01:45:34,140
OK so that that may make sense

1729
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:46,240
somebody asked me about about blind model just talk a little bit about the relationship

1730
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:48,640
between line model golf approach

1731
01:45:49,390 --> 01:45:51,160
it turns out the girls processes

1732
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:56,240
well many models that are commonly used in the basic and machine learning

1733
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:58,570
actually special cases the golf pro

1734
01:45:58,570 --> 01:46:00,800
the final one of those

1735
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:04,340
but ryan in and quickly

1736
01:46:04,390 --> 01:46:06,550
it sketch of

1737
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:10,300
what the connection is between you've explain model

1738
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:11,840
and the golf course

1739
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:13,840
in fact i'm going to i'm going to show you

1740
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:16,490
the golf course that could be my morals

1741
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:23,260
so i apologize looking for people not familiar with and by the way the too

1742
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:25,590
fast to understand exactly what is going on

1743
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:29,360
the idea in in my models the the u

1744
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:30,780
look at this

1745
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:33,430
i function like this

1746
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:35,860
it has been if you look at the

1747
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:37,010
function here

1748
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:41,530
and the square difference between the function value in the information and you have the

1749
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:43,030
regularisation term

1750
01:46:43,050 --> 01:46:46,700
which regularizers with which penalizes basically

1751
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:52,040
dedication to ensuring that you are clear about where you're going and that you're clear

1752
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:55,790
that the things that you're doing right now

1753
01:46:55,870 --> 01:47:00,330
contributing to where you want to go ultimately so the the second step and i'm

1754
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:03,580
not going to spend time on this morning because i could see i the number

1755
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:06,410
of people that i got all my i god is going to do is go

1756
01:47:06,450 --> 01:47:08,580
development workshop call

1757
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:09,580
help me

1758
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:12,450
get me out of here no and not

1759
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:15,790
there are dozens of programs you can do and in fact

1760
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,420
if anybody here

1761
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:21,820
doesn't have for themselves and not asking for sure and

1762
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:26,490
if anybody here doesn't have themselves a clear compelling set of goals

1763
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,570
make sure you let me have your

1764
01:47:28,590 --> 01:47:31,570
email address before the end of the session

1765
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:33,640
because i have to send you

1766
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:37,990
i documents of book developed by a friend of mine in australia

1767
01:47:38,030 --> 01:47:40,040
and he wrote this book

1768
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:43,700
and he made the goal that he was going to give away free of charge

1769
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:45,550
one million copies

1770
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,800
and it's a step-by-step process

1771
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:52,620
for putting together a set of personal and professional goals really well done sort of

1772
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:55,950
thing you expect spend a lot of money and he didn't do it because it's

1773
01:47:55,950 --> 01:47:59,450
just a really nice guy he's a nice guy because he has his name and

1774
01:47:59,450 --> 01:48:02,160
he has a telephone number on the back of a million copies of the floating

1775
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:07,070
around the world hasn't done any harm whatsoever but if you don't have clear compelling

1776
01:48:07,070 --> 01:48:13,280
goals if you don't have confidence self talk if you are not absolutely positive and

1777
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:15,570
focused you cannot be

1778
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:18,450
a charismatic leader you cannot inspire others

1779
01:48:18,490 --> 01:48:20,930
to engage and trust

1780
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:23,680
those are two critical first steps

1781
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:25,780
the next one is

1782
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:29,870
charisma are is the physical side of things and i

1783
01:48:29,870 --> 01:48:31,240
i mentioned already

1784
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:36,100
a large part of charisma is trust

1785
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:40,140
you want people to engage with you you have to win the trust first before

1786
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:42,390
anything else they have to trust you

1787
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:45,660
nobody is going to give you their time

1788
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:50,180
their energy commitment nobody's going to believe what you are committed to the goals that

1789
01:48:50,180 --> 01:48:53,390
you have them unless they trust you

1790
01:48:53,410 --> 01:48:55,760
and a huge amount of that trust

1791
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:58,390
comes down to things that have nothing to do

1792
01:48:58,450 --> 01:49:01,550
but the words that you've said or did you say

1793
01:49:01,570 --> 01:49:05,320
now when i stepped up on this stage this morning

1794
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:08,180
in about two hundred milliseconds

1795
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:09,550
you decided

1796
01:49:09,550 --> 01:49:11,680
what do you like me or not

1797
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:15,370
whether i was at friendly person or where there was threat when i was an

1798
01:49:15,370 --> 01:49:18,620
enemy when i was going to give you something i was going to take something

1799
01:49:18,620 --> 01:49:21,430
from it all happened you know

1800
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:26,120
fifty the second it all just that you made those decisions without any real conscious

1801
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:30,510
thought you made that decision you made that determination and that and that shape certain

1802
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:33,600
amount of the way you reacting to me now

1803
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:39,780
that decision was made in a small part of your brain called the amygdala

1804
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:45,760
the amygdala is a small almond shaped part of the brain right on the brain

1805
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:51,410
stem right in the core of the oldest part of the brain

1806
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:57,200
they tell us that it's probably about five hundred million years old and that was

1807
01:49:57,200 --> 01:49:59,030
the first brain that we all

1808
01:49:59,030 --> 01:50:01,760
when we evolved into reptiles

1809
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:06,890
used to survive and it basically has the same functions as a reptile brain has

1810
01:50:06,890 --> 01:50:07,840
today date the

1811
01:50:07,850 --> 01:50:11,870
the scientists refer to it as the reptile brain at all it's about is keeping

1812
01:50:11,870 --> 01:50:13,530
you alive

1813
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:17,470
a reptile doesn't think oh look at that eagle over very looks rather big

1814
01:50:17,490 --> 01:50:22,530
i wonder is he going to now that they think is the carnivorous or omnivorous

1815
01:50:22,570 --> 01:50:25,450
what know he sees something

1816
01:50:25,470 --> 01:50:28,260
and by the size of it by the shape but by the way it moves

1817
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:32,890
consistently it makes the decision and i gonna fight you've heard or my going to

1818
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:35,430
sleep and my going fight or flight

1819
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:39,780
i'm going to fight this thing are run away most basic

1820
01:50:39,830 --> 01:50:43,970
of survival instincts and deep inside all of our brains

1821
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:48,140
we react in that way to every single person we meet every day

1822
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:53,200
every second day way way down below the more complicated parts of brain to make

1823
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:56,370
those decisions now when you look to me walking up here you look at my

1824
01:50:57,510 --> 01:51:00,240
if you look at the way i was presenting my body you look to what

1825
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:04,050
shape i was making what was going on in my face and all of that

1826
01:51:04,050 --> 01:51:07,820
happened recently and you we decided to say you like me or you didn't like

1827
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:12,280
me and then on an ongoing basis you you really you redefine the decision again

1828
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:14,990
and again and again you say when you going to trust me or not now

1829
01:51:15,370 --> 01:51:17,870
as i stand up here

1830
01:51:17,890 --> 01:51:19,180
i consciously

1831
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:23,850
try to use body language that will appease your reptilian brain and make you feel

1832
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:28,800
OK i make you feel that i am somebody to be trusted because long before

1833
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:34,160
i speak anything to you that you like or dislike you will make that determination

1834
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:39,890
every single thing you do every single move you make is important

1835
01:51:39,930 --> 01:51:41,680
let me give you for example

1836
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:47,300
r is a crucial you have shake hands

1837
01:51:47,390 --> 01:51:52,450
OK now i that very basic body language could could issues would you mind

1838
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:57,910
now focusing on going to teach me kill this from moment to find me

1839
01:51:57,910 --> 01:52:02,050
the first thing the teachers show you how to shake hands and the way

1840
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:05,100
that somebody what absolutely mistrust you

1841
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:08,450
will not like you and will have a negative impression of trade-off

1842
01:52:08,470 --> 01:52:12,820
OK so what's this gentleman's reaction as i shake hands with high harry it's very

1843
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:15,640
nice to meet you have to go

1844
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:18,680
so that he knew he knew

1845
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:22,570
i was going to do something that was going to but even though we knew
