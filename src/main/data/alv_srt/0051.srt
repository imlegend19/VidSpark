1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
so these these we want to have a monitoring system which will take the CPU

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:11,450
measurements for everybody the network measurements from everybody and try to find anomalies and outliers

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,400
and forecast potential problems so that we can pull out this

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,360
this unit

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,770
so this is the problem and the motivation

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,520
two subproblem similarity search and data mining so let's see the first problem how do

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,590
we do similar to search through indexing and feature extraction let's see the index first

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,440
so we have here's the problem given a set of multimedia objects and let's focus

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,480
on time sequences for illustration

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,920
right we want to find the ones that are similar to a desirable query remember

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,250
we have the stocks this is not microsoft stock so that we don't laugh and

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,200
and this is another part right and want to find everything that is within ten

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,650
dollars away from

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,190
from the red part

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,280
we have to figure out what a good distance function how to measure similarity between

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,540
time series how how do you measure similarity

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,810
these are all the same length three sixty five sixty five right

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,240
it turns out of the best of the fest until it comes to your mind

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,570
he is actually correct and probably the first time series

20
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,350
the euclidean distance right some of different some of the differences squared right so the

21
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,690
euclidean distance makes alot of sense

22
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:30,000
other distances exist like some of absolute value differences and so on but there are

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,710
performing about the same there's also the time warping distance

24
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:40,810
which says that you can accelerate and decelerate but the the the query patterns

25
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,030
but for stock prices this is not

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,560
this makes no sense for voice it doesn't make sense to accelerate and decelerate so

27
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:52,870
some expert gives the distance function and usually the euclidean distance and want to solve

28
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,730
the problem

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,510
the problem is so well defined right if we want everything within ten dollars distance

30
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,410
away that we could even solve with sequential scan right take the first

31
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:08,900
the first sequence compute the difference between the partners it below ten dollars yes OK

32
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,480
print it is it above ignore continue right so this is a well defined problem

33
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,160
how could do faster right if we have one million time sequences each of them

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,200
being three thousand time ticks along this might take a lot of time right how

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,080
could we do faster than that

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,590
and the idea is

37
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,510
but we could extract a few features

38
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,720
instead of keeping all three sixty five days for overstock we could have a quick

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,350
and dirty description of every time sequence so we could of one set of features

40
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,410
not necessarily the best but good for the station is to take the over and

41
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,340
the standard deviation if those stocks have completely different operators and completely different sound vision

42
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,130
there's no way that would not

43
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,220
mike stock is average five you actual stock has other one thousand

44
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,690
there's no way they could be within ten dollars from each other so this a

45
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,400
once we had a few features taliban other deviation every stock price becomes appointing two-dimensional

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,900
space are quickly becomes another point in two dimensional space remember the queries are in

47
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,350
query want everything was in ten dollars away support this aquarium and right so then

48
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,080
we are we have transformed the problem into an geographic problem special problem find all

49
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,660
the city is about ten kilometres away from my favourite city right

50
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,940
and the good news is that there are a lot of reasons which will help

51
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,570
us understand the geographic which is so here is the outline of the

52
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,200
the methodology whenever we have in multimedia

53
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,550
similarity search problem what we can do we can extract we can sit down and

54
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,240
i o thing can't extract a few features two three four five features

55
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:56,150
right numbers that will describe our in our stock prices images video clips someone

56
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,520
by once we have done that then every in munster stock price we took it

57
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,170
becomes appointing two three four five dimensional space then we can use off the shelf

58
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,270
spatial access methods sams as they called

59
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,500
to find the qualifying images there's a footnote here we may have false alarms but

60
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,380
we can always discard false alarms right

61
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:24,490
using the exact the euclidean distance or whatever the domain experts said the correct distance

62
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:30,560
the method has been used for time sequences and the features that were extracted was

63
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:36,690
the discrete fourier transform it was used for modifications to the euclidean distance were offered

64
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,190
by like his and his colleagues and then back to mendelssohn and the woodruff and

65
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,100
so on the method has been used for images of the cubic project of IBM

66
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,110
which will see later again two more like stage four video clips showing for media

67
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,100
for automobile parts shapes in germany

68
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,130
kriegel from university munich and his colleagues and so on and so forth so let's

69
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,220
a little bit about special xmas because this is one of the

70
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:10,260
a wonderful methods that can withstand that withstood the test of time so they deal

71
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,140
special xmas methods we have a collection of cities

72
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,980
right and we want to spend money on state of the united states and want

73
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:23,380
and define recursively as so that that's an easy definition there

74
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,610
there are more general ones but this one is that the easy one

75
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,620
where that that that man is seen as a sum plus or minus one

76
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:39,510
the the elements of the first line times are the minor

77
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,740
of the matrices of the metrics with that these minor is

78
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,610
is the metrics without a line and without

79
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,450
rope without row without for example here

80
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,900
for tree by tree matteris you see here we have first element

81
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:04,430
then this minor second element and the matrix form by this vector

82
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,690
and this one thirdelement and so on and so on

83
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,200
so what's interesting about determinants

84
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,350
is it's air related to inverse matrices so i go to inverse matrices

85
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:29,960
so inverse much is our define so as much as a is called

86
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,310
non-singular ought evert invertible if there exists

87
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,350
a matrix b such that the product of these two metres give

88
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,100
the identity and if these b exists so

89
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,920
the inverse of our is not i'm in one needs to be

90
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,510
so what is interesting is that if the determinant of my matrix

91
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,130
is non zero then i know that my matters is invertible

92
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,200
which give me

93
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,470
if i have n equations with n unknowns

94
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,480
give me the solution of my in equation by inverting

95
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,270
the matrix so if i have no one hundred by one hundred metrics

96
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,990
equation problem i take the metric say look if he's determinant

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,810
is nonzero if is non zero i directly have g here the solution

98
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,930
of my my in equation so let's let's go back to the

99
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,760
to the geometrical view and in which the determinant in fact it's

100
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:44,120
at that the surface form by the two column vectors of my metrics

101
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,910
in that to dimension of course introd and nations cated and

102
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:56,490
so yeah and it's easy to verify if you if you go to for our

103
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,010
polar are called coordinates

104
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,890
what you see is if if my two vectors are calling yeah as a so

105
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,300
before the determinant would be zero because the surface

106
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,700
it's a completely flatten so just to to verify that what we were

107
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:26,170
saying before held for that it's ok so what happened when that

108
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,140
that was when metrics a is a is a square it's easy we take the inverse

109
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,790
but what happened with it's easy to is rectangular

110
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,890
we take the pseudo-inverse scald so the inverse

111
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:46,270
and yeah so that's health for any and matrix

112
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,150
providing that's eighty times a is invertible course

113
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:59,260
i'm talking about rectangular trees there is one which is really

114
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:04,010
interesting which is a bit already talk about today

115
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,560
which is the metrics where i take where each line

116
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:14,500
is one of my examples and that are

117
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,490
the so as i said before that scalar product is something which

118
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,810
are really interested in because it is

119
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,230
related to the distance between our

120
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,840
vectors so one matrix which is also of interest is the gram matrix

121
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,870
where each component it's that the the component

122
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:41,630
i j is the scarpa looked of the vector of the example a i t

123
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,560
times the vector the day example j

124
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,990
also or something which you always reading books

125
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:59,020
which is the the metrics i'm considering must be positive difference

126
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,080
if needs which on means in fact that the

127
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,360
billionaire form which when i'm taking a vector and non zero vector

128
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,690
and i a which plate left side and right side

129
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,180
my metrics it must be a positive or zero

130
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:28,360
and gram matrices are always positive semidefinite so that's one

131
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,780
one thing you always do you there's a lot of theorem that holds

132
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,900
if matrices positive semidefinite and

133
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,480
we we we want often machine learning top plate to gram matrices

134
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,000
which hopefully are positive semidefinite so

135
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,370
no the only person to think about it

136
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,620
ok so for example this metrics we sometimes want to

137
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,600
raise it to the poer to see what would be the distance or something

138
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,760
created the distance not between two vectors but

139
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,940
between these vector and so one passing true though me once so the

140
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,810
distance the path to go from one to the other

141
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,590
in tree in treaty times so it's interesting to to be able to raise

142
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:34,570
to the to the to our and for that matrix degradation is really

143
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,410
is is really something you want to do

144
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:44,870
so and eigenvector of matrix a is a solution

145
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,050
a non-zero solution of this equation

146
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,330
which cannot see it can also be seen as

147
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,310
in fact i want to find the environments kind of the invariants

148
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,320
of my application a so that if i look at the metrics as an

149
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,360
as a linear transformation what happened to these eigenvectors dane

150
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,880
fact are just striation stretch but not

151
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,910
they don't change direction honest stritch so

152
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:26,620
it's close to invariants idea so of course these it's equivalent

153
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,330
to these with i being the identity matrix

154
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:37,050
an eigenvector has associated eigenvalue so for solving that you

155
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,520
first go to the view through the the cursor sick polynomial

156
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,340
and solve this which is yeah the support

157
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,300
about supervised i

158
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:56,160
like the fisher discriminant i support vector machine that supervised by

159
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,940
so in these are good admitted that are available for a lot of examples and

160
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,290
their associated correct answer

161
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:11,240
i want to find the idea of learning is to find anybody sh drawn from

162
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,720
an opportunity for space

163
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:25,540
i'm sorry but so the idea of learning is to find i know but this

164
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:33,010
is a draw from mine portland point based such that it performs well on the

165
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:39,420
training but also to construct the well known as the labelled from y

166
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,650
from a new test sample x

167
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,820
in the traditional supervised learning setting this is the function is a map from an

168
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,360
input space from two n out space

169
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:59,150
the regression the output space is simply there is a set of real numbers can

170
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,360
be binary classification

171
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:07,620
the output space is set plus one minus one of labour's plus one minus one

172
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,790
in multiclass classification

173
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,710
the output space is the set one

174
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,880
we have k classes

175
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:23,030
what is structured output learning from the output learning contd

176
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,200
it uses the same idea to learn map h from input space to an output

177
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:38,050
space but consensus considering more complex output spaces then they once considered by regression classification

178
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,620
why structured output learning well there is the need of structured output learning

179
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:51,960
because because many problems are in many application requires dealing with structured data

180
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,420
that can be represented by sequence of by graph or was simply by images

181
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:05,930
and these happen in many fields like computational biology computer vision natural language processing

182
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:12,620
structured output learning framework has been developed to cope with this problem in a principled

183
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:18,440
and and know to be able to to

184
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,070
three the director there

185
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,360
probably without losing the information about

186
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,130
this tract

187
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:32,890
i give some example of structure and named entity recognition NE one example we have

188
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,840
for example in this case the sentence

189
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:41,340
spanish sentence and we want to find for each word in the sentence at time

190
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,160
and that indicate for example name of location organisation

191
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:54,030
and since then we you can approach this problem as simple multiclass classification problems where

192
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,430
where we have

193
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:03,140
a set of four percent of the value of but that there are the war

194
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,960
and we have set that the the top

195
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,080
we can

196
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:18,310
we can compute to each label for each one severity

197
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,740
but it will be you will be

198
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,660
but if we can compute the all the label of sentence together in order to

199
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:31,510
take into account the interaction between ideas and not others and

200
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,690
problem can be somehow addressed the sequence labelling problem we are given an input sequence

201
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:43,000
x i want to stress that the set labels of equal length

202
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:51,920
in this supervised learning framework what want to do is given a training set of

203
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,040
correct phase of sentences and their associated that we want to learn to assign new

204
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,830
and it is from a new sentence

205
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:09,080
another example of structured output problem either biological sequence alignment when we have to see

206
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,460
sequences the biological humans i want to deter mine dissimilarity between them

207
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:21,410
and bioinformatics given to see when is a global alignment is an assignment of gaps

208
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,540
such as to line up each letter in one sequence it with a gap or

209
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,610
a letter in the other

210
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,070
this is an example of two two sequences and an associated alignment what we have

211
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,390
for example you know that the match between the two sequences

212
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:42,340
through the gaps and green there

213
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,610
i means that

214
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,770
in general be given to see when we have an exponential number of possible alignments

215
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,270
can be represented in a compact way as but into a graph

216
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:02,300
it is usually referred to as the alignment graph by the possible alignment correspond to

217
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:08,180
part from the upper left corner to the lower right corner

218
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,600
from unsupervised learning point of view what we want to do is given a sequence

219
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:22,850
where we want to be able to predict the correct sequence of alignment operations so

220
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,590
the currency was of matches mismatches gaps

221
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,710
the that example is for RNA secondary structure prediction

222
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:37,730
and given any sequence and want to be able to predict the most likely sequence

223
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,250
that is that there is that there is some of the funding of the sequence

224
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,050
on itself due to either it in my

225
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:53,500
this problem is can be approach has a sequence parting problem so given an input

226
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,700
sequence x one to deter mined in society part the y

227
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,730
having defined an appropriate context free grammars

228
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,550
can't speak either

229
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,850
he invented a set of

230
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,960
know that you seem like a set of nineteen model and the set of rules

231
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,020
and the starting symbol for example on

232
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:22,310
and given the sequence x y is an example of possible

233
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,930
from the point of view also provides

234
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:31,510
we want to address the problem or any secondary structure prediction in this way

235
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:38,700
given a training set of correct RNA secondary structure we want to learn the might

236
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,820
be able to extract the most likely secondary structure for the new

237
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,890
any sequence

238
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,620
i do address this problem in a principled way

239
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,680
we extend this supervised classification does to want to be able so this time again

240
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,210
a training set of input output

241
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:04,000
but this time in the out put the it's multilabel it's complex

242
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:09,930
again we want to find out you like but this is a page that is

243
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:14,530
the market from people input space from two outer space

244
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,860
such that it performs well on the training set and is also able to

245
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:27,830
construct the optimal level of the optimal output for a new test sample x

246
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,810
usually is

247
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:34,750
started out with the old people do is to define a scoring function that is

248
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,000
a linear function

249
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,010
of some features phi

250
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,170
the defeat of some

251
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,490
mapping joint parking of input output five

252
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,760
w again the vector of parameters that we want to

253
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,570
and the predictions e

254
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,970
given new

255
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,320
right and frankly we tried this model and it wasn't working very well for us

256
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,360
and sometimes people call these models do doing harmoniums

257
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,470
so we need to go beyond so what we're doing here is we're using a

258
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,540
class of models called deep boltzmann machines

259
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,210
from edible which you can think of them as just markov random fields

260
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,110
u half

261
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,200
latent variables but you're introducing dependencies between hidden variables

262
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,230
right so what changed from the previous model is that you having these two additional

263
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,380
terms and these terms and modeling dependencies within each one image to image to image

264
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,820
did so explicitly

265
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,780
putting dependencies between latent variables and all connections undirected and in this case it's a

266
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,370
much more expressive model than the simple are began

267
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,870
but also it's a little bit more complicated because hidden variables become dependent even when

268
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,780
you conditionally so it will play

269
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,590
a little bit of when we start learning these models it becomes a little bit

270
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,570
more challenging to fit these models but again

271
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,580
they much more expressive so now what we can do in terms of building a model

272
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,070
is we can use

273
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,310
does not be an essential to model do

274
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,970
that's real valued image features we can use replicated softmax all what count data and

275
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,640
we can build ourselves a hierarchical model here

276
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,200
okay one nice thing about these deep boltzmann machines

277
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,500
in this case multimodal tables machines is that there is a very natural notion of bottom-up and top-down

278
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,440
right so information can flow from the low-level features of words all the way

279
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,840
down to the low level feature representation of images

280
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,800
right so it's it's unlike some of the other models like deep belief networks and neural nets type of

281
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,080
type of models

282
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,110
now in terms of learning let me just give you a preview of how learning

283
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,560
is being done with these models

284
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,510
we can

285
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,460
do approximate maximum likelihood learning if you look at the negative log probability with respect

286
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,720
parameters in this model it comes down to being the difference between two expected terms

287
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,950
so it's expected sufficient statistics driven by the data minus expected sufficient statistics driven by

288
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,350
the model

289
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,370
in this particular case unfortunately even expected that is sufficient statistics driven by the data

290
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,390
you cannot compute in closed form

291
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:05,120
because you've dependencies between hidden variables but there are ways of life fitting these models

292
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:11,500
and effectively so using mean field approximation set of expectations and we using markov chain

293
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,080
monte carlo

294
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,870
all what's called stochastic approximation algorithm to approximate the second set of expectations

295
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,010
and i'm not gonna get into much in the theory behind it but you can

296
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:26,080
show almost sure convergence guarantees under certain conditions of all of this learning rule to

297
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,170
as particle asymptotically stable point of the variational lower bound so some nice theory behind

298
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,380
these algorithms and and you can prove

299
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,310
certain properties about them

300
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,960
but now the question is how well does that doesn't do right so here's again some a few images

301
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:44,780
this is condition on images generating text from those images

302
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,030
and most of the cases it doesn't capture

303
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,670
meaningful structure right so that's capture what

304
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,210
what you see and there is always a bias towards canada

305
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,560
right because this model was created in canada

306
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,520
in any case there are also some feelers right so the model is not perfect and here's some

307
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:04,740
daily examples

308
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,740
if you're looking at this slide things as it is just basically

309
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,750
women soldiers right and now impression of that's because this is the flickr dataset most of the time people

310
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,080
post pictures of

311
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,970
themselves and follows as opposed to pictures of animals right

312
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,950
i also like the second one

313
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,720
you confuse it with barack obama election in politics and

314
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,480
my student convinced me that it's is because

315
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,030
you know

316
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,910
obama signs typically carry blue and white

317
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,950
science also it's making a mistake here

318
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,210
but i have a different theta i think if you just keep looking at this

319
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,390
picture for long enough you would you start seeing hope and change in

320
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,700
and obviously the model that's the right the right choice here

321
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:45,970
you can also do

322
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,270
the other way around so this is the case where we can

323
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,950
it because it's a generative model again we can sample from one delta conditional another

324
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,230
modality and again the model he's initialize the completely random state so here we're gonna

325
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,190
be generating cars and auto mobiles and such

326
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,760
you know it

327
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,660
one interesting thing about these kinds of walls notice how fast the markov chain mixes between different modes

328
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,520
right and jumps between pictures that are very different from each other

329
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:20,100
and sometimes it gets stuck for a few iterations but then it doesn't move around

330
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:25,110
quite quickly so there is a conceptual wisdom market chain monte carlo methods are very

331
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,670
in this case it doesn't seem to be the case

332
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,590
right so that's that's the reasonable job

333
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,150
right and that's

334
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,900
well that's not in terms of some of the examples given some text these images

335
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,090
that the model is generating retrieving

336
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,260
in some cases again the failure modes here if you look at the very last

337
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,430
wrote in in the query he was chocolate cake so it retrieves

338
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,870
even though again i would argue these cannot look like chocolate cakes right always you can make stuff up

339
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,440
but now

340
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,300
one other thing about this model is at

341
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,610
and if anything about this model is that

342
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,840
we can

343
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,910
leverage large volumes of unlabelled data to train these models and there will be crucial

344
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,330
in our applications so we can train these different e pathways separately

345
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,430
now in terms of just let me give you a couple of

346
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,210
examples and give you some quantitative evaluation of this model

347
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,310
this was done using a my we dataset you have about one million images

348
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,460
with users assign tags so we have images and text sometimes they meaningful sometimes they're not

349
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,910
in terms of the kind of architecture using

350
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:39,360
we have a multimodal dibble's machine with about twelve million parameters

351
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,670
and about six million latent variables hidden variables

352
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,550
in terms of features we using just joseph impact of about four thousand five dimensional

353
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,490
image features we use in two thousand

354
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,320
constitutes the instance level

355
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,010
defining the tee box as well as the a box areas

356
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,580
languages have been standardized so

357
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,470
the original language is

358
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,000
the language of description logics

359
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:18,190
i mean i think now for say five years the world has discussed the web

360
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:25,190
ontology language the recent version is OWL two and fall to various sublanguages has been

361
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,830
defined that are suited to different application areas

362
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,940
as you may have seen it is useful to also

363
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,490
holds about particular instances concerning

364
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,700
the relationships

365
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,870
of the classes and relations of instances between classes so

366
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:53,640
also we need a query and manipulation language we might want to interactively modify

367
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:57,130
the relations between individuals right

368
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,450
in the

369
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:09,910
ontology community there are various standards for querying and manipulating these instance or terminological searching

370
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:15,370
such as dick one two l API or reason standard that is called a link

371
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:24,200
having defined an ontology consisting of terminological as well as a search knowledge

372
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:30,030
we would like to have all queries answered and this is then formalised as a

373
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:36,160
set of decision problems so for instance we might query whether the ontology might make

374
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,150
sense at all so if we impose restrictions on the meaning of the primitives that

375
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,580
we have chosen then it might turn out that they are contradictory in the sense

376
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:51,810
we defined restrictions such that we determine there is the concept that is a sub

377
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:57,310
concept more specialized concept and another concept this is usually known as subsumption

378
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:03,260
might also be able to find implicit facts about what we have said for particular

379
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,310
instances as you see

380
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,960
solving these incidents

381
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,840
these decision problems we need

382
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:19,280
reasoning engines and so usually there are reasoning services for the

383
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,390
class level for the t box as well as for the

384
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,710
a box

385
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,540
projects deal with how to make this

386
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,380
effective and how to provide for

387
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,440
scalability i will not talk too much about the details about the reasoning engines

388
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,010
i will talk about

389
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:48,310
way ontologies are used such that to get an impression what can be done in

390
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:52,540
your local area of expertise with the technology

391
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,770
usually one doesn't write down

392
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:01,250
ontologies is using a textual language one could do so

393
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,310
in an editor but usually one uses

394
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,010
ontology editors and

395
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:13,270
one of the most well-known editor is the protege editor and i have

396
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:21,770
opened the main protege window here so you can assume that i uploaded

397
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:27,850
some university ontology into the system and then i can use the produce facilities to

398
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,060
add some axioms

399
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,360
there are many people

400
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,560
in the world the just defined the model

401
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,770
and our

402
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,090
not really aware of that the model might be

403
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,680
unsatisfiable that is to say it doesn't make much sense or their implicit things that

404
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:55,350
machines could to dig out so many people use ontologies without ever exploiting reasoning facilities

405
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,770
i mean usually

406
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,460
given the

407
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:05,240
expressiveness we will study this later of the languages it is

408
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,970
not unlikely that there are implicit things being said so one

409
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,310
should press

410
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,680
but in that reveals implicit things

411
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,610
i think some of you are already familiar with the classification service that uses a

412
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:27,140
find implicit information in the t box level and as you can see here this

413
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:33,110
is assumed to be a display of the asserted hierarchy and uris within the machine

414
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:36,000
has computed the inferred hierarchy

415
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,040
and this it i think to

416
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:45,390
get some information that for instance the chair concept has moved from an explicit set

417
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:50,640
concept of person to an explicit sub concept of professor i don't want to dig

418
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,250
out now all the details why is the case this will be done later the

419
00:31:54,250 --> 00:32:00,420
message going to make here is that using the reasoning facilities

420
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,510
during ontology definition time

421
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,040
really is really helpful

422
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:14,390
and in many cases also reveals concepts whose death was definition doesn't make much sense

423
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,550
with respect to the whole ontology

424
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,340
OK we have been talking about

425
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,690
class level

426
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,490
relations between the instances the concept

427
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,290
the relations between the instances of these are

428
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:40,250
declared either textually or with the editor that you see here and

429
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:47,710
now we use reasoning facilities to dig out the implicit things and the idea of

430
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:51,920
this way to define ontology is to do it in the top down

431
00:32:54,010 --> 00:33:00,600
so one first defines the concept presses the button classify and checks out whether the

432
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:07,380
reveal implicit things the implicit things may be unwanted

433
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,270
things it might not be

434
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:16,050
intended to have chair as the concept of professor right and then

435
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,860
it is

436
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,630
apparent that the model must somehow be revised and it won the ontology is defined

437
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,230
people of the ontology is defined we can use this

438
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,600
i have a clear is and said about individuals so i call this the top

439
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,450
ge ze

440
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,330
the first

441
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,360
in some mining heterogeneous information networks

442
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,490
because for this conference so many

443
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,800
workshops are going

444
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,990
after our struggle

445
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,140
which says everyone

446
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,760
which is true

447
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,720
this is one way of thinking about this is not just

448
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,290
overview of the introductory material

449
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,120
this one is going to be

450
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,360
down to the

451
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,400
most of them regardless of pain

452
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,660
is the last two or three years

453
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,440
in sense it's quite up to date

454
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:26,790
it is not hard to understand it's quite important information network analysis

455
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,300
so either way

456
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,760
and to give this tutorial

457
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,260
so the tutorial on their

458
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,270
and so

459
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,290
it was the

460
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:47,390
of his life he wants to make it easier to and she just married you

461
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:50,210
work workshop just the you

462
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,900
last time

463
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,380
on one of the things

464
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,650
he goes

465
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,930
you know

466
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,880
assistant professor at UC santa barbara

467
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,540
he said he was idea for many years

468
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,630
chairman of the

469
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,080
no it had to be useful

470
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,220
we call this

471
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,520
four slots

472
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,620
fall the things we want to partition one is on the motivation and here is

473
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,900
where the stream into parts

474
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,880
one is a song by australian a

475
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,790
at some point in search

476
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,960
the first one on my talk page or discovery

477
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,070
founded in the world

478
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,040
so we first got this one

479
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,940
our you for social network communication network which never quite

480
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,500
the first question one task is

481
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:03,600
what are information networks or what whether they have the same or

482
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:06,810
they very different from social networks

483
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,440
or some other networks

484
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:14,470
so the information for the general definition is

485
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,380
we get lost in all

486
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,690
and also some kind of the information

487
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,810
it could be

488
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:26,840
person like social network could where the research paper

489
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,190
conference so

490
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,530
and it is

491
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,360
and we lists need to get

492
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,450
and also the fact that

493
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:44,450
professor supervises student can teachers students you can collaborate with sister schools

494
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,570
but there are ways you conferences

495
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,380
conference of

496
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,190
i don't know

497
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,850
but that doesn't mean that i think it's

498
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,190
one thing need to touch the things we want to discuss this

499
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:04,200
first is homogeneous

500
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,130
one of the homogeneous what the

501
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,350
homogeneous means

502
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,810
think of time

503
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,140
time is one

504
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,310
for example

505
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:21,570
you say france like facebook friends with friends

506
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,450
well the link friends don't see this kind of of

507
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,670
yeah it's

508
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,450
all we know to know

509
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,980
so so you

510
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,440
link this also kind of objects in

511
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,590
these we call

512
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,100
o to

513
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:43,380
the web page for example you look at the same pace

514
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,310
so when there are many different pages i don't

515
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,670
these are used

516
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:54,080
you know some things you want to on so the was

517
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:57,490
you can see this one homogeneous network as well

518
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,720
but in real life

519
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,400
we found that many many words to produce these

520
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,550
martin high one

521
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,920
this gives is for example

522
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,100
american men

523
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:13,140
we patients doctors hospitals treatments

524
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:19,340
prescription all the things emailing about was patients

525
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:25,020
he was patients are probably with the third carried against me

526
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,170
you may say

527
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,700
the doctor

528
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,340
the prescription

529
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,850
that's not the person to link with the hospital

530
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,040
these are different things including together

531
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:40,850
they played

532
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,240
so that one

533
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,720
these we have to understand the homogeneity

534
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,910
and the different types of e

535
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,420
the same thing that we use these objects

536
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,170
the last

537
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,300
we have a conference aspect e

538
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,520
we also have attendees these

539
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,600
we have

540
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,770
a paper may terms

541
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,240
no they are going to get

542
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,840
but these are typically

543
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,870
heterogeneous information

544
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,990
what this talk

545
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,020
understanding is we are not

546
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,970
on the australian prime prime minister

547
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,350
the heart

548
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:21,220
and because the very strong australian

549
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,790
and so what happened is that

550
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,200
it passed in

551
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,180
something as a stray alien

552
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:31,720
but he went to say well australian

553
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:38,700
important speech recogniser not the local conditions

554
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,890
this was actually at the time when he was talking a lot of about illegal

555
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,970
aliens there was particular

556
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,640
novelty detection

557
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,510
so what can you do that

558
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,080
well you might want to decide whether points news

559
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,220
the network is

560
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,310
and with digital belong to that respect

561
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,270
let's say you're system

562
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:05,830
you need to make sure that universe universe trying

563
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,660
and all the sudden something strange happened

564
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,520
you don't really know what it is but you basically know they're getting more losses

565
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,220
immediately you think something is wrong

566
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,790
even though you might be able to to

567
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:22,040
he might not have seen exactly that situation before

568
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,020
even though you might not know exactly what is wrong but you will probably say

569
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,100
something wrong

570
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,540
now was systems are expensive

571
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,770
and you don't always get the really skilled one

572
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,100
we have another problem is that the moment but anyway

573
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,950
what you want to do is you want to program that

574
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:44,720
give him hand in telling him well this is unusual in that one is

575
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:49,220
or handwritten digit you want to just really we'd have to really badly written on

576
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,350
the maybe have a human tried to to stop them

577
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,290
or a lot of sense

578
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:59,470
so if you have a car alarm in his car

579
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,200
not many people are OK

580
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:08,390
if you have a car alarm on your car in the parking lot fresco by

581
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:12,470
and at some point i mean most of us will have serious noise by random

582
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,740
car alarms going off night

583
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,100
black and of course the only isn't that is like a car with the kind

584
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:24,280
of the concept of sanction so what happened basic the sensitivity of the car alarm

585
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,620
was just

586
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,080
way to finally

587
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,330
on the other hand what you also don't want to happen is that well the

588
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,990
alarm is just just so widely that it knocked the wind

589
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,450
and that's the breaks in

590
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,750
it can run away with that

591
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,220
so what you would actually

592
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:46,120
rather we want to have a system that automatically correct

593
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,390
for that you want automatic notification

594
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,060
and what a lot of ways i can consider things not

595
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,290
basically problem in the one of the breaks apart

596
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,770
by the way how much fun to play

597
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:11,850
here this is it i i have the right

598
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:21,010
OK so i think a lot of time i'll go very quickly

599
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,410
OK well i

600
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:26,270
let hear it so that what isn't especially

601
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,140
try this on a mac using

602
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,950
escape exporter

603
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,990
i tried to model the maximum

604
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:38,870
it's quite may quite amusing in the first two three car races actually make a

605
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:39,740
lot of things

606
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,810
but then you realize

607
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,330
also the brain doesn't work

608
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,950
so what i'll be talking about

609
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:54,160
after burn next lecture make explicit the lectures is about that is the probability theory

610
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,370
you know it's a bit of a shame that i cannot do that before i

611
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:04,470
basically this learning the language about how to deal with event

612
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,060
that would help

613
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,220
OK good so

614
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,540
well basically the series you want to

615
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,430
find out the probability

616
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,660
that well

617
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:21,040
certain things how you all know the basic axioms of probability theory namely that the

618
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,850
probability of being has be here in one

619
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,100
the probability that something happens to one

620
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,620
and if all the events of the joint being

621
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:32,620
over all of that is the probability of the joint

622
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,930
the event

623
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,200
and that of course means that

624
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:41,430
the probability of the events happening which are not necessarily chime in with probability one

625
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:42,770
the intersection

626
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,540
and here's the proof

627
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,720
this happens that happens

628
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,810
that's probably that both at

629
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,010
and so

630
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,830
the joint

631
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,060
just think but that

632
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,350
well this

633
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,310
but that one that

634
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:03,560
you could have more than one variable

635
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,720
and well

636
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,310
i mean if x and y are independent i can actually write

637
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:11,220
the probability that he of x y

638
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,220
what is an application

639
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,350
let's say you want pregnant you want to find out player

640
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,850
you go to the drug

641
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:24,950
and let's assume that the marginal probability that getting boys and girls i library at

642
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,390
twenty five was a

643
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,790
but the case that you have a point of

644
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:36,510
this starts goes because this crystal ball in the back room come back i know

645
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,640
it's going to be able to write

646
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,720
and how find that of the other one

647
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:46,120
what people would realise this guy always is out of oil

648
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,600
so the expected o point six percent change in radius

649
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:54,850
and so the two thirty eight will end up here

650
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,250
i exaggerate very highly and the two thirty five

651
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:01,800
o and p two thirty eight has a larger radius because it has a larger

652
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,300
you see that here

653
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,830
there's no change in b

654
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,830
no change in human there's no change in capital v

655
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,790
we accelerate them over the same

656
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,350
potential difference

657
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,850
and so if the radius

658
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,730
for instance where one meter

659
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,050
of this mass spectrometer

660
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,540
then the difference here

661
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,100
remember this is two are

662
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,980
the difference will come out to be about one point two centimetres and so you

663
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,440
have a collective here

664
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,130
you can lecture two thirty eight

665
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,930
adams and u u

666
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,730
collected thirty five and that's the idea

667
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,700
a mass spectrometer

668
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,690
why did i choose this particular example

669
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,310
well this example

670
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,370
changed our world

671
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,320
and it made history

672
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,950
you're eighteen to thirty five

673
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,150
i was needed by the americans

674
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,840
to build an atomic bomb

675
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,940
o and the second world war

676
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,770
this is

677
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,040
this was done under the

678
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,960
famous manhattan project

679
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:04,050
and ernest lawrence of berkeley

680
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,520
built mass spectrometers

681
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:11,790
which were able to separate uranium two thirty five to thirty eight

682
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:18,690
in the beginning it went very slowly about one hundred micrograms per day

683
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:23,290
but a few kilogrammes was required for an atomic bomb

684
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:27,070
they finally managed to get up to one gram per day

685
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:32,150
and in combination with other separation techniques such as the gas diffusion techniques

686
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,560
which i will not discuss you know

687
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:37,260
they managed to get a few kilogrammes

688
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:40,790
and they dropped the bomb and they rush him on august six nineteen forty five

689
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,490
and three days later

690
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,240
the bomb was dropped on

691
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,860
japanese surrender

692
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,250
it was the end

693
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:53,370
of world war two

694
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:57,800
it's a good thing that there are many peaceful applications nowadays of mass spectrometers

695
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,320
particularly in the medical area

696
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:03,180
people sometimes require radiation

697
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:06,940
and the need radiation from a particular radioactive isotope

698
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:08,280
but you don't want

699
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,980
the other isotopes from the same element and so

700
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,490
two separate them then

701
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,930
with a mass

702
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:16,790
the whole industry

703
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,350
very important industry

704
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,020
and i would like to address the issue have you

705
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,530
extremely high speeds almost approaching

706
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,180
the speed of light

707
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,250
and that

708
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,030
there's also something for which

709
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,490
ernest lawrence is credited

710
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:43,850
in early days it was done in a cyclotron

711
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:48,970
which i will describe to you know

712
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:58,680
which is called a d

713
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,480
this is one d

714
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:03,610
and here's another the

715
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,590
conducting chambers

716
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,600
look from the side

717
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,510
would look like so

718
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,180
this is the left chamber

719
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,740
this is the right chamber and all of this in vacuum

720
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,030
and let's assume

721
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,020
that we have a magnetic field coming out of the board

722
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:26,350
like so

723
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:31,790
that's really visit our one MTV proton

724
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:35,820
suppose i release in this chamber here

725
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,500
one MTV protons

726
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:41,290
and i know the speed with which it comes out because the one in the

727
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,500
had be you still see their one point four times ten two seven meters per

728
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,540
we also noted in one test field let's make this one test well

729
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:57,010
that the really is is going to be fifteen centimeters using it up there

730
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,520
so what is this proton going to do

731
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:02,370
it's going to do this

732
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,500
but when it gets there

733
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,820
potential difference is introduced between these two

734
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:14,240
so that this is low or high potential and this is the local council

735
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:15,050
and so

736
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,710
you're going to get an electric field now

737
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,140
in this gap

738
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,040
in this direction

739
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,930
so this proton is being accelerated that suppose

740
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,090
that's the difference

741
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:30,030
is twenty kilowatts

742
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,180
this program will in

743
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:36,380
electric in kinetic energy it will gain kinetic energy twenty

744
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:41,000
kill o electron volts that's the way control is is defined

745
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,110
and so

746
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,380
you start off with one anything

747
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:45,590
so when it has

748
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,290
cross this gap

749
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,690
it is now

750
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,790
one point o two and

751
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,770
twenty kv

752
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:01,270
the rate is now is larger

753
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,570
if capital v

754
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:06,510
two percent higher and i go to this equation

755
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:08,120
the radius

756
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,960
is one percent higher

757
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:10,790
and so

758
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,880
when it comes out here

759
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:14,430
and it makes the circle

760
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:20,160
the rate is now is one percent higher than fifteen centimeters

761
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,000
but when it gets to this

762
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,150
part of the

763
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,990
this potential difference is reversed

764
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,900
and so the electric field

765
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:33,260
again in this direction in the direction of the proton and so it is accelerated

766
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,840
again by twenty

767
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:39,210
general electric now to radius of course is even larger

768
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:40,890
so very gradually

769
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,210
every time that reaches the gap

770
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:47,410
the potential differences change in direction to accelerate protons

771
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,010
and so it gradually

772
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,710
spirals out and

773
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,510
to the largest radius

774
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,200
that you have so doing one full rotation

775
00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:01,030
it gains twenty kilogram volt one thousand twenty kilogram full price

776
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,150
so against forty kilo electron volts

777
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,240
and so the electric field

778
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:11,760
i doing the work they accelerate the particles magnetic fields cannot accelerate

779
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:16,510
magnetic fields can change the direction that they can do no work on the particle

780
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:21,240
so the magnetic fields confine the particles

781
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,850
let's assume we go

782
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,490
twelve hundred

783
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,030
and twenty five

784
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:28,320
four locations

785
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:31,910
during each rotation

786
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:36,280
kinetic energy increased by forty kv

787
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,760
so if you multiply the two

788
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,450
and you see now that

789
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,460
kinetic energy of the proton

790
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,570
increased by forty nine

791
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:48,300
million electron volts

792
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,520
because it went twelve hundred and

793
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,820
twenty five times all the way around

794
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,590
so now you have

795
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,820
forty nine NTV plus the one two started with

796
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:02,190
so now you have a fifty

797
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,790
i mean

798
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,860
you the second line there

799
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:10,290
there we have that fifty and the proton

800
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,470
but i discussed the issue here

801
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,350
in one test field

802
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,820
now the radius is one meter

803
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:21,480
like for NHS some some come on there is part which is conserved among the

804
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:25,520
the twenty minutes is this is about is used to make the things but you

805
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:26,740
are and what you

806
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:32,040
the specific part which is different the twenty minutes is so you can have be

807
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:36,180
all small businesses are going to have a positive charge and negative charge density are

808
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,330
so you have to differences

809
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,870
and typically

810
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,320
all the proteins

811
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,210
are something come which is the consequence of businesses and what the difference is the

812
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:49,700
ordering of the is used so you can think of the states within india but

813
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:55,260
and when you write your data different sequences the new different parties with different functions

814
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,340
and what i mean

815
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,580
problem is that fact proteins can have a huge variety of functions they can

816
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:06,930
many of them for instance are called enzymes because they they act as catalysts configurations

817
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,700
many of them are used to make the structure of the cells of the organism

818
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:14,300
so we want to make a membrane we want to make glue between things these

819
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:18,020
many of them are used to carry information

820
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:26,050
for instance when i can take information between cells are so the is incredible hall

821
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:33,870
however was able to use this common framework to produce and to give the assumptions

822
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:38,760
so something i universities is how you will find in two

823
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,130
the proteins that

824
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:45,630
four letters so there is a sequence of four photos i said that are and

825
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,770
is very similar to what could be

826
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:53,980
DNA into RNA with the transcription you could be want what appears there is a

827
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,770
difference which is that instead of a t c g university by u

828
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,130
OK this is what people are named after DNA

829
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,780
but this is the and a second a here is that there are so you

830
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:10,970
want to one directors of our of DNA editors of RNA

831
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:15,060
but then properties of about twenty eight hours twenty amino acids

832
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,930
so this is where the agency called comes in because the actual decided that one

833
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,470
of the the

834
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:26,990
many ways to to make a computer science state sequence of RNA into a sequence

835
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:28,460
of proteins

836
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,800
in fact there was a debate at some point what is or how much is

837
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:37,560
that in fact it shows very simple scheme which is that it changes to what

838
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,060
the sequence of foreign a it was it took two

839
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,590
to search by

840
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:48,470
three so they all sequences of three letters in the middle of forehead sort like

841
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:53,020
a because each sequence of three are in a

842
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,780
is associated one amino acids

843
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:59,070
so this is already done because as you can see you when you have four

844
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:04,060
letters and three parameters is you for full-time for which is sixty four

845
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:10,340
what spoken and sixty four and this is what is now this is the falconer's

846
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,090
some up to the twenty amino acids so you have the time that the sentiment

847
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:15,000
as it

848
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:21,220
OK so what i mean the president of three nucleotides nucleotides and for the basis

849
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,580
of DNA

850
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:29,290
it's called the

851
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:35,820
yes so i know it has been studied a lot and i know that before

852
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:40,260
it was discovered there were people doing speculations about it because before it was discovered

853
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:42,060
we knew that there was another

854
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,250
proteins were

855
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:48,890
were made of amino acid so there were many speculations and what could be discovered

856
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:53,560
that i am not aware of any from results i don't think it's three optimal

857
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,560
in terms of doing something

858
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,030
but surely i don't know

859
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:04,920
anything that has been done

860
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:09,760
OK so it's to to the human genome project now

861
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:15,280
what you want to sell the chromosomes DNA DNA used to make proteins

862
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:21,060
and so despite in in the system was discovered quite a few decades ago you

863
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:26,290
see that it is so i the central was the main idea of what's biology

864
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,340
and so if i go back to the central dogma

865
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,170
is it becomes interesting

866
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:35,370
to look at DNA because it's very little looks like a program and this is

867
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:40,260
the same is the string matching the constant that trees to putting so there is

868
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,780
a simple idea which is that if i was able to know all the DNA

869
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,620
and if i give you the

870
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:50,300
the genome of an organism and if i give it to clever tricks anti-social to

871
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:57,560
the guys don't necessarily consistent is by far the genome then probably i could because

872
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,120
the more i know i know that because i know part of how

873
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,490
imagine a world

874
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:07,220
well fortified if i the DNA i should be able to understand how it works

875
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,760
OK there is the idea that the brain to find the group then i have

876
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:15,280
a good chances to reconstruct how it works so

877
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:17,800
since the eighties there are several

878
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:23,600
the other sequences technology was developed sequencing means reading the letters of DNA

879
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:30,530
it's not easy but it's possible and after a successful sequencing of of simple organisms

880
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:36,490
was decided in two in nineteen ninety start project of sequencing the human genome

881
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:41,830
so first we can assume that these are the spiciness of course you know that

882
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:44,510
we are all different all the events of different so when i talk about the

883
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,620
there is not one single

884
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,160
six sources unit test

885
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:53,530
describe all the humans because we all have different DNA is what's called dimension of

886
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:58,740
insight is that each side of the species like in human you operations among individuals

887
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,970
but the vibrations the alterations there are many variations

888
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:04,700
but among the

889
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,100
among the six billion it

890
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:12,640
roughly speaking six million version six million liters for human so the rights of variations

891
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,050
among individuals is one to one thousand

892
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,600
OK development project was to sequence

893
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:23,970
an average human society several people were sequence

894
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:26,660
there were five two competitive projects

895
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:32,470
recall that but need several people like all the other ten to twenty people were

896
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:36,050
sequence and so the was to discover the ninety

897
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:41,550
nine the nine point nine percent of commentators because all the dimensions and also to

898
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:42,780
discover the

899
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,100
o point one percent of partitions humans

900
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,680
so that is

901
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,200
the time spent

902
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:55,280
in communication and taken from the computation is to all that like the communication with

903
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,760
the computation

904
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:02,390
so while for if we use asynchronous communication means that the

905
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:08,930
let's define synchronous communication and asynchronous communication in synchronous communication

906
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:14,840
when decide to send the message to another

907
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,470
he stops the execution of their

908
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:24,180
they start sending the message to deal with the end of of the communication process

909
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,800
will not every pattern to this sequence of instructions

910
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:32,760
these are synchronous communication that advantage is that when we read from

911
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:34,490
the communication operation

912
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:40,260
we actually one hundred percent sure that the destination machine has received our data our

913
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:43,010
we can assume

914
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,160
in our called

915
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:53,280
in asynchronous communication what we do we started their communication operations sending a message

916
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,700
and then we ask the operating system

917
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,510
to complete the operation so

918
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:01,800
we can agree that what we call

919
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:06,160
continue executing at the instruction computation

920
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:11,410
but in this case it's not guaranteed in our called during the execution of expression

921
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:16,340
our called it's not guaranteed that the machine has received the message not yet at

922
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:19,470
with take longer

923
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:20,660
so it's treaty

924
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:25,950
because we may assume that the emotions know something it's not too

925
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:28,200
not yet true

926
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,950
overlapping with asynchronous communication can

927
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:33,490
increase the along to the performance

928
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:38,740
but it's more complex

929
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:45,090
so let's say a few words about how we evaluate how green speed up everybody

930
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:47,110
you should know something about speed up

931
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:49,950
but the let's define

932
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:52,010
the speed up

933
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:54,700
is defined as the that's answer

934
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:55,950
between there

935
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:59,030
time taken by the fastest

936
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:02,160
known sequential algorithm

937
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,910
not anyone

938
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:09,220
no they were not the one we have finalized but the fastest known sequential algorithm

939
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,180
for this problem

940
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:15,550
over the time taken by our talent how algorithm

941
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:20,180
so it's not fair to to compare the parallel algorithm with the is lost when

942
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:25,070
in this case

943
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,550
we can define

944
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:32,050
in the algorithm we are paralyzing we can let's say we let's assume we are

945
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,360
we are using the same

946
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,050
sequential algorithm here

947
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,990
and we know that we use

948
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:43,870
for the part of so we take one out we analyse the system is

949
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:45,630
in this case

950
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:49,700
we can look into the outcome and recognise that these maybe

951
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,320
part of the which is sequential

952
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:56,090
it cannot be executed in more than one machine

953
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:59,300
and then it about which is part of life

954
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,050
so we can paralyze the only despite

955
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:03,950
the result will be that we have

956
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:06,760
only one process of BC at the beginning

957
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,340
and then after they finish the sequential component

958
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,160
the other can contribute to

959
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:15,320
in the parallel combined

960
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:19,910
so we have part fraction the sequential fraction then the speedup can be expressed in

961
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:21,950
terms of these

962
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:23,590
two fractions

963
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,050
when we look at the chart

964
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:29,340
what we need to keep in mind is that

965
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,660
linear speedup which is the

966
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,820
the maximum daily collaspe be that we can reach

967
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,430
if we use

968
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:42,130
eight machine the best we can do we can imagine to do

969
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,490
his driver's the speed up of data

970
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:47,910
in this case the entire program

971
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:49,320
has been

972
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,890
divided in eight five

973
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:59,160
and each processor executes one eighth of the entire problem

974
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:05,760
sublinear it what usually happens because we have the communication overhead we've had a parallel

975
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,590
overheads so we do more work than the sequential called it

976
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:13,390
we will get to sublinear speedup

977
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:16,050
in some rare cases

978
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,910
we can get super linear speedup

979
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,050
the article point of view formerly it's formally it's impossible if you see is super

980
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:28,130
linear speedup you can conclude that the

981
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:32,910
we didn't use the fastest known sequential language

982
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:38,050
so it's wrong results you can reject the paper

983
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:41,470
but there are two cases when this man in

984
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,370
one is

985
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:47,300
due to the memory you can we were discussing before because we are not using

986
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,700
it to the machine we are using real machines

987
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,720
and the memory yes he

988
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:55,010
produces phenomena

989
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:57,890
which may introduce opinions

990
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,200
because now

991
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,910
a big problem which doesn't fit

992
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:05,280
in the first level education second location is global the

993
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,970
memory to the around

994
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:10,950
now if we split it in several parts we get a smaller problem which may

995
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,890
feature in the case

996
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:15,360
so it will be executed faster

997
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:20,010
then the sequential

998
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:22,050
in this case we can

999
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:23,840
find out

1000
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,680
if we simulate the department called

1001
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,090
in a sequential machine

1002
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:30,860
if we do that

1003
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:35,110
again we will get here better performance from the sequential called

1004
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,780
what we thought was the super linear speedup becomes

1005
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:42,550
linear assembly

1006
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:45,660
the second is exceptions

1007
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,640
and search algorithms

1008
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,760
because of search algorithms

1009
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:55,530
let's say we are looking for a solution we don't know what the solution is

1010
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:58,480
in the domain and the search space

1011
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:01,180
and if we use the sequential algorithm

1012
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,930
we have to sequentially

1013
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:05,840
trying one by one the solutions and

1014
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,990
if we are like we get the solution

1015
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:14,160
before of we unlike we get it at the end if we have enough processing

1016
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:18,610
we can look at several solution in parallel

1017
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,590
from a statistical point of view we analyse the it's likely we get to the

1018
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:27,050
solution faster than the sequential

1019
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:29,070
that's why for set out

1020
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:36,340
can up and then we have superlinear speedup

1021
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,390
the speed up

1022
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:39,340
not only

1023
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:42,490
OK occasionally nested these references

1024
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:48,360
but there is the and that's law which says that that we have the maximum

1025
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:50,240
speed up to

1026
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:54,390
when we increase the number of processing elements

1027
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:58,490
let's say we two

1028
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:00,450
do we get

1029
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:02,410
is there a limit for this

1030
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:03,430
we keep

1031
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:05,260
increasing increasing

1032
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:09,090
there no this just the one before

1033
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:10,680
if we increase the

1034
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:16,130
processing elements does this does increase

1035
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:22,260
it's not possible because any program has fry fraction sequential fraction

1036
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,200
sequential importance

1037
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,700
so i'm law

1038
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:30,360
he's talking about these sequential component when we have the sequential component which is not

1039
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,870
even if it smaller

1040
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,450
we can say if we

1041
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:39,090
increased and see the number of

1042
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:43,530
processing elements the maximum speed up

1043
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:47,900
and i can show on the screen this light that comes back i'll see the following

1044
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,240
will see red on the outside

1045
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:52,630
and then i will see

1046
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:57,240
something that's bluish but maybe not perfect blue

1047
01:06:58,030 --> 01:06:59,550
and then i will see inside here

1048
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:01,510
white light

1049
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:03,360
and he will see no light

1050
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:08,360
because phi cannot be larger than forty two degrees

1051
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:10,960
so no light will strike the board here

1052
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:12,840
she read

1053
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:15,490
gradually other callers come in

1054
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,260
and then

1055
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,650
you will see white light

1056
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:19,740
and that's

1057
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:22,420
at the heart of understanding of these

1058
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:24,480
the rainbow

1059
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:27,260
gonna put you out on the field

1060
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:29,900
u i

1061
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,650
i'm going to make it rain

1062
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,210
the grading

1063
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:46,860
we don't want a son anymore at the horizon because it's too special case so we're gonna put on

1064
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:48,530
the eye on the sky

1065
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:50,980
the put son

1066
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:53,190
then this guy

1067
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,780
okay you're standing there so is there what you see

1068
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:03,150
you see a shadow

1069
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:04,960
and here is your head

1070
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:05,760
the shadow

1071
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:08,190
and here is your body

1072
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:09,860
and he

1073
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:12,940
that's just the way it is that shadows right

1074
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:19,170
just happened to be looking in this section of the sky

1075
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:23,710
we'll get the rain there

1076
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,380
there's a raindrop years a range of new orders

1077
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,900
thousands of raindrops in that direction

1078
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:36,010
it's one of these raindrops

1079
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:38,940
is returning to the sun

1080
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,480
called light

1081
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:43,480
and that call

1082
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:46,030
is red on the outside

1083
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:48,240
and the rest we know

1084
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,860
i'm only going to draw you

1085
01:08:51,150 --> 01:08:52,030
the red column

1086
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:59,650
and you'll get this report

1087
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:03,300
and this one this one this one this

1088
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:09,740
what do you see what is the colour of the rainbow

1089
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:11,400
it's not read

1090
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:15,340
not looking at this red light all because the red light is

1091
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,800
only hour

1092
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,220
part of the common what color you see

1093
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:20,920
you see white light

1094
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,260
because you're looking somewhere here

1095
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:28,710
we've seen all the colors you see that very small angle so you see registry greasy

1096
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,720
so you see white light

1097
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:33,420
thank you very much you see white light

1098
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:36,260
that's the white light it is returned

1099
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,960
in the range of interaction of the sun

1100
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,690
well you also looking in this direction

1101
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:43,940
looking way higher up in the sky

1102
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:48,940
and so you raindrops

1103
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,360
direction of sun

1104
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:55,070
and so

1105
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:56,900
it's one of those raindrops

1106
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,210
they don't know any better

1107
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:00,940
throwback the sun

1108
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,240
forty two degree angle

1109
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:06,380
the cone of light

1110
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,760
what is the color that raindrop

1111
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:19,780
you don't see it there is no light coming back to outside come

1112
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:21,010
no light

1113
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:24,840
so you're looking at interaction that is forbidden

1114
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:29,840
if i cannot be larger than forty two degrees and if you would see light coming back

1115
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:32,090
would be larger than forty two degrees

1116
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,050
or if you're very good

1117
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:38,300
we're going to look

1118
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,190
in a very special direction

1119
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,800
going to look in a very special direction

1120
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:47,380
i'm looking to disarray

1121
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,360
and this angle now

1122
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,780
i have chosen to be forty two degrees

1123
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:02,760
notice is forty two degrees away from the direction the sun

1124
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:05,920
it's one of those raindrops going to

1125
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:07,360
throw at me

1126
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:14,820
forty two degrees

1127
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:17,840
the direction the sun

1128
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:21,150
and it's going to throw back nice cold in the sky

1129
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,210
what is the color that raindrop

1130
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:33,360
because i'm exactly looking at the right conditions

1131
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,960
but i'm just seeing

1132
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:38,990
this part of the code

1133
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:39,780
so now

1134
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,740
you've almost created for yourself

1135
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:48,710
because remember it's completely actual symmetric so you can rotate the whole thing about this axis

1136
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,460
it is you write the rate

1137
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:55,860
so now it going to see it forty two degrees away in this guy is

1138
01:11:55,860 --> 01:12:00,240
going to see only read every raindrop that is forty two degrees away from this

1139
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:01,880
is only read

1140
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:03,570
if you go inside

1141
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:04,960
the ball will be right

1142
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:09,590
outside there will be no light and gradually as you approach the white

1143
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:10,690
it will become

1144
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:13,670
and so you're going to see

1145
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:15,570
something like this

1146
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:18,690
let's assume

1147
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:22,320
sons of degrees

1148
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,260
above the rise and

1149
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:26,710
so that this angle

1150
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:28,440
forty two degrees

1151
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:32,360
there you will see the outside of the ball

1152
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,190
inside the ball

1153
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:38,110
white light

1154
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:39,740
you may never have seen

1155
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:44,740
sixteen bright sometimes we very bright white it's dark

1156
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,670
don't means that you see the clouds

1157
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,610
it means no light coming back from the water

1158
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:56,110
and the clouds normally dark when it is raining so that's why i said are you see right

1159
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:58,050
you see the clouds and then

1160
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,460
you will also see

1161
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:01,340
gradually other colors come in

1162
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:02,800
so he inside and

1163
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,860
you have a blue appearance and there you see

1164
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,090
the formation

1165
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:08,260
of the rainbow

1166
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:13,480
if you go through a similar sequence of geometry

1167
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:15,320
which are used elsewhere on

1168
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:18,050
actually also used for now falls

1169
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:21,760
it's tell you about intensity it's a little bit more complicated

1170
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,960
then you can also demonstrate

1171
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,820
that is the second ball

1172
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:30,010
call that the second that this is called the primary bright wonderful

1173
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:33,440
there's a secondary which is not at a forty degree angle

1174
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:35,800
from the direction away from the sun

1175
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:40,860
what is higher in the skies about ten degrees higher than the fifty two degrees and the colors rivers

1176
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:44,420
many of you may never have seen it and the reason why you may not

1177
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:48,360
have seen it is that the primary so much brighter than the second day that

1178
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,800
you pay no attention the secondary

1179
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:54,010
but it almost always there are provided to support that water drops

1180
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:55,860
at that's fifty degrees

1181
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:01,630
i'd like now to

1182
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:03,760
look at a few slides

1183
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,110
first before we attempt

1184
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:07,240
to answer

1185
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:08,530
the questions

1186
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:11,380
so let's look

1187
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:13,820
at slight number one

1188
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:20,040
normalized when no

1189
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:23,230
OK let me show you this more

1190
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:28,920
carefully in this important cases

1191
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:30,400
the weight vector updated

1192
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,310
vector is

1193
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:37,750
the euclidean distance squared to the old guy

1194
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:42,230
plus the hinge loss

1195
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:44,320
and then

1196
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,230
if you differentiate is

1197
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,520
you end up with this

1198
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:52,570
this fancy delta rule

1199
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:55,480
but the gradient of the future

1200
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:57,070
is used here

1201
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:59,090
the approximate gradient and now

1202
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:03,650
this is the normal perceptron algorithm

1203
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:09,230
the perceptron algorithm doesn't update when

1204
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:12,770
when you're correct so when this is the same

1205
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:15,590
you don't have to date only when you're wrong

1206
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:20,090
this is slope becomes one and you add in eight times x

1207
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:23,710
and that corresponds to sort of

1208
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:26,440
when you correctly on this site

1209
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,040
you conservatives you don't do it it

1210
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,000
but when you the wrong side

1211
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,380
you slope this one

1212
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:40,440
and you get an update

1213
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:43,130
similarly you can get the normalized winnow

1214
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,670
now you just a

1215
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:49,460
the bregman divergence

1216
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,230
to be

1217
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:53,920
for the parameters to be the relative entropy

1218
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:55,920
and over here

1219
01:15:55,940 --> 01:16:02,690
they lost again which is another bregman divergence

1220
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:04,840
if you

1221
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,940
differentiate is an approximate

1222
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:09,340
the gradient

1223
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,460
you're in

1224
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,310
with this kind of

1225
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:23,810
this is

1226
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:28,770
normalized winnow algorithm

1227
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:31,860
so it's the same situation

1228
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:39,610
except use the different parameters versions

1229
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,540
the overall scheme is

1230
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:45,670
trade between two

1231
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:49,820
the parameters

1232
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,610
which measures how far you move in parameter space

1233
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:55,770
and sort of the loss divergence

1234
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:58,190
how much you moving to los space

1235
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:01,650
and online learning algorithm is

1236
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:06,820
trade off between the two

1237
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:13,960
this divergence measures this distance in parameter space to this one this is in

1238
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:19,940
what distance divergence in in labeling space trade off the two

1239
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:22,130
and minimize my w

1240
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:24,340
he this the online setting

1241
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:27,670
we're take this then there the last class

1242
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:30,500
loss of just the last instance

1243
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:35,550
i can also immediately get bashed out within spitting distance to the divergence

1244
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:40,570
and then the loss is summed over all examples

1245
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:44,590
they get back problems

1246
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,820
if you do this

1247
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:51,400
then your day always has the following form

1248
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,150
it is

1249
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:54,480
link function applied to the old

1250
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,380
weight vector

1251
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:01,020
eight times the gradient

1252
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:03,960
which now has a simple form

1253
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:05,960
hw t-minus

1254
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:09,860
the next few months like this sort of the this is the y

1255
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,630
this was the prediction y t

1256
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:15,090
minus twenty

1257
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:17,570
and this is known as the delta rule

1258
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,090
you know it's sort of

1259
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:22,840
from the network lingo

1260
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:28,540
the generalized rule because you have this meaning function if you do know networks they

1261
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:31,070
only and always did this

1262
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:32,790
when the link function

1263
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:40,000
the identity function

1264
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:45,270
but now we do this also when the link functions for instance the log

1265
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,900
then you would get lot w e to the

1266
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:54,140
and that

1267
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,900
back in the field

1268
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:58,450
because new zero times i

1269
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:03,190
times and divided by l accepted this and divided by l no

1270
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:07,030
the number of windings of my current wire and this is the length of my

1271
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:10,730
soul don't confuse it with the one we had there that was on an atomic

1272
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:15,460
this is on the macroscopic scale many windings

1273
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:20,010
could be where you had a big one year in class twenty eight hundred windings

1274
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:21,740
sixty centimetres long

1275
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:24,350
so that's what this number is all about

1276
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:26,750
so the moment that i

1277
01:19:26,770 --> 01:19:30,160
i know what the current system i sort of i need to know what my

1278
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:33,450
vacuum field this one-to-one correspondence

1279
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:37,930
and now i'm going to matter inside the ferromagnetic materials but i stick in the

1280
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:41,610
solenoid and measure the magnetic field

1281
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:43,860
what's going to happen now

1282
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,780
first of all i can not at all

1283
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:47,950
love this curve

1284
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:50,050
on the one scale

1285
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:51,660
the reason being

1286
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,680
cap of four ferromagnetic materials

1287
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:57,960
is so large

1288
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:01,780
that was done for now number of one thousand say

1289
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,210
o could be largely that's a kappa

1290
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:07,110
is one thousand

1291
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,820
that means that if the

1292
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,800
magnetic fields

1293
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:14,160
in terms of

1294
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:17,890
this big

1295
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:20,640
one centimeter in the length of the factory

1296
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,570
the field inside

1297
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:27,850
ferromagnetic materials a thousand times higher

1298
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:32,530
this is one centimeter in length a thousand times higher is ten meters

1299
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:38,400
so this is the length of the vector of the magnetic field inside the ferromagnetic

1300
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:46,190
that's why i cannot do it or scale

1301
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,410
so when i draw the line here

1302
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,060
among the if i didn't screw

1303
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:54,060
if i did but i can't

1304
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:56,450
the tangent of all

1305
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,630
recap of of

1306
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:01,380
which in this case we can do

1307
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:05,840
so this angle of find something like eighty nine point nine something degrees

1308
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:09,350
so i cannot do it or can keep that in mind

1309
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:12,940
in the beginning i get a nice linear curve

1310
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:16,250
but now slowly i'm beginning to reach saturation

1311
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:19,230
that all these dipoles are going to be aligned

1312
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:22,080
what you're going to see is that this curve

1313
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:25,340
hands over ends of events over

1314
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,330
and the

1315
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:29,930
magnetic field that you finally achieved here

1316
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:35,490
is is the famous two point three which i calculated for that imaginary material

1317
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:39,080
the fact

1318
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,000
two point three

1319
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:42,500
is not the field

1320
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:45,960
i will call b prime

1321
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:50,540
this is the field that is the result of the alignment of all those dipole

1322
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:54,960
and so when i increase the vacuum field this goes into saturation

1323
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,540
and several for two point three and can no longer increase because i've aligned magnetic

1324
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:03,730
and so

1325
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:05,070
if you

1326
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:07,250
vacuum field is strong

1327
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:11,670
and this field is no longer a thousand times stronger than the vacuum field is

1328
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:14,240
no longer in the linear part

1329
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:18,380
so you also think of it the kappa have been smaller than

1330
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:19,320
several way

1331
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:20,780
you prefer is fine

1332
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:22,180
but it's no longer

1333
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,810
two the value of

1334
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:26,300
one thousand

1335
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,250
if the temperature is lower of the material

1336
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:33,800
it's easier to align them so you achieve saturation earlier

1337
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,640
so you could go like this curve is also a function of temperature

1338
01:22:37,650 --> 01:22:38,810
so this is

1339
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:40,900
if temperature is low

1340
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:43,090
relative this one

1341
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:47,180
but his car depend on on temperatures well below what temperature the easier it is

1342
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:53,530
to align the

1343
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:56,200
if i read this point here

1344
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:59,040
when i b prime goes into saturation

1345
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:01,560
i can only increase the field

1346
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:03,340
the field in the material

1347
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:05,320
by increasing the vacuum field

1348
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:08,470
b prime is not going to go up again

1349
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:11,680
and so i can only get a higher field

1350
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,960
by increasing this current so that this is a vacuum goes up and that goes

1351
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:20,510
very slowly because this huge magnification factor one thousand

1352
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:21,810
is gone now

1353
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:24,440
so to slow is very slow to growth

1354
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:26,970
that's why you see that i would like this

1355
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:27,690
that it

1356
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:29,880
increases very slowly but

1357
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:35,930
plot is not to scale any

1358
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:37,750
now i want to discuss the issue

1359
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:39,690
what happened was the material

1360
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:42,520
once i have driven it into saturation

1361
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:43,600
what happens

1362
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:45,680
if no i changed the current

1363
01:23:45,710 --> 01:23:47,030
and i make my

1364
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:49,570
vacuum field zero again

1365
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:53,560
now you get a very unusual behaviour

1366
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:57,280
let me do you on the blackboard

1367
01:23:57,330 --> 01:24:00,320
so i make new drawing i could have continued with that one but let me

1368
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,240
make one

1369
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:04,460
so i'm going to

1370
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:07,670
do the following experiment in my head

1371
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:11,210
i have a solenoid

1372
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:14,610
and i currently that sort of knowledge

1373
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:16,450
and if the current

1374
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:19,030
it is in a clockwise direction

1375
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:21,030
my vacuum field

1376
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,670
will be in this direction

1377
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:25,280
and the current in counterclockwise direction

1378
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:26,830
i will assume that my

1379
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:31,830
vacuum is in disarray ferromagnetic material

1380
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:36,220
if the current flows in a clockwise direction effective field direction

1381
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,680
running counter-clockwise direction

1382
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:41,720
the fact that the right

1383
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:45,920
he was going to be my vacuum fields

1384
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:50,360
easy for me to know whether this because if i know the current my solenoid

1385
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:53,970
this equation will immediately tell me what the vacuum field is so i've never any

1386
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:55,770
problem with the vacuum field

1387
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:58,170
i think appropriate here

1388
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,580
and i measure the magnetic field inside the material how we do that is not

1389
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:03,190
so easy we can do

1390
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:04,540
two things that

1391
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,000
i can tell you this is one

1392
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:12,260
so here is the magnetic field inside the material

1393
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:14,270
all right so there we start

1394
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,650
we do the same thing that we did here

1395
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:20,980
we approaches saturation now and i'm here

1396
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:24,570
i am reducing the current single back to zero

1397
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:28,950
remember that when we hear all these domains that we discussed last time have all

1398
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:31,950
in the direction of the vacuum

1399
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:36,220
huddersfield is enormous but now i a current go back to zero

1400
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,590
and what happens now is

1401
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,020
i end up here

1402
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:42,190
at this point here

1403
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:43,990
the current now is zero

1404
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:48,070
there is no current going through the solenoid notice the vacuum field is zero i

1405
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:53,800
can take the material out the ferromagnetic materials the material itself is no magnetic

1406
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:54,690
and you see

1407
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:56,410
there is magnetic field inside

1408
01:25:56,420 --> 01:26:01,240
why is there because some of those domains remain aligned they don't go back

1409
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:05,900
but the experience and experiment so you could can in principle

1410
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:11,770
think of thinking and behaving brain

1411
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:13,410
that's quite

1412
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,970
people in computational neuroscience

1413
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,990
OK so just

1414
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,560
to start with some

1415
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:31,790
seminole invasive BCI work

1416
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:43,860
he would have a monkey that sits on the chair

1417
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:47,380
that's that's due to an equally cynical

1418
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,370
and you with

1419
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:50,580
the monkey has

1420
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:55,650
is the surgery and there's some metal electrodes in his brain

1421
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:56,590
and then

1422
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:02,790
these brain signals there typically air raise no show you how they what they look

1423
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:05,840
like later

1424
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:08,700
and so

1425
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:12,680
the data is required and then you need to

1426
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:15,700
transform it into the code

1427
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,920
the brain signals and

1428
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:21,060
the intention of the monkey

1429
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:22,820
what is doing

1430
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:27,750
and one wants the the idea was here was that the monkey had to do

1431
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:32,160
the task control

1432
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:34,790
a robot arm

1433
01:27:34,830 --> 01:27:36,850
whoops with that

1434
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:40,340
so the monkeys to control the robot arm

1435
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:46,190
and what he's doing that they recorded

1436
01:27:46,210 --> 01:27:51,400
the motor cortex premotor cortex ever neurons there

1437
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,590
they get some

1438
01:27:55,490 --> 01:27:58,090
spike trains

1439
01:27:58,100 --> 01:27:59,790
from that

1440
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:05,460
so this is the hand position

1441
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,110
the monkey

1442
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:12,620
the idea is to learn the mapping

1443
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:22,990
so to say the spike trains to the robot position robot arm position trajectory

1444
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,710
so this would be the training

1445
01:28:26,730 --> 01:28:28,160
in the testing

1446
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,870
would be

1447
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,790
that you

1448
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:40,790
turn off the i mean that you you keep the the monkey on fixed

1449
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:44,930
and you just use the brain signals

1450
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:48,270
to control the robot

1451
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,630
this is very similar

1452
01:28:54,660 --> 01:29:00,420
set up from andy schwartz see is the fixation of the data

1453
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,690
of the monkey army

1454
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:05,670
you see that the monkey

1455
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:07,880
so can

1456
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:15,500
it's actually sitting quite comfortable and in fact most people don't know that that

1457
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,750
if you

1458
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:18,270
i have a monkey that

1459
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:21,950
that is not feeling well it is not doing any work so you cannot use

1460
01:29:21,950 --> 01:29:26,390
them for experiments so some of the monkeys that

1461
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:29,290
schwartz was was working with the

1462
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:30,460
they actually

1463
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:34,640
after many many years of work in the lab they are now

1464
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:38,430
and so to say retired and they went to the zoo

1465
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:46,650
there are now older than than typical monkeys living in the outside world and in

1466
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:52,130
they can take they are now subject to aged studies on monkeys

1467
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:58,710
so i just in tokyo there was an element in the short and he was

1468
01:29:58,710 --> 01:30:00,860
telling me this didn't know before

1469
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,840
OK so so here's

1470
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,660
to say that two see part

1471
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:11,520
see these are typically electrode arrays

1472
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:14,170
you see here

1473
01:30:14,570 --> 01:30:19,970
this is the a brain and you see how it this now

1474
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:25,550
starting to get planted see here how these these

1475
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:30,840
put into parts of the brain and you see that there's a a lot of

1476
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,660
them in the brain

1477
01:30:32,690 --> 01:30:36,570
stuck into the brain and motor area

1478
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:39,500
premotor area and so on and so

1479
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:44,730
the new this is sealed and

1480
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:50,200
you to the signals and you can try to control robot arms with

1481
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:57,750
so in fact it's from the signal processing offer even from the title technological point

1482
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:03,130
of view this is quite advanced because you have to deal with a lot of

1483
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:08,160
you have to amplify quite a lot of signals in rather robust manner

1484
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:14,870
so that they are measuring the width of the order thousand electrodes so that's that's

1485
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:16,580
quite a lot

1486
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:18,150
to sample from

1487
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:25,390
so maybe the most impressive

1488
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:30,590
resolved that that i think is around is due to

1489
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,870
this is a video of of

1490
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,770
and the short from andy schwartz left

1491
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:37,110
and you see that

1492
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:39,860
the monkey this is

1493
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:42,380
o thing is so it's not the monkey arms

1494
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:45,160
stuck into this so the monkey on the somewhere here

1495
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:48,060
it's fixated

1496
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:50,610
and you

1497
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:51,700
you see that

1498
01:31:51,730 --> 01:31:53,330
well you will see

1499
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:56,850
that by my intending

1500
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:01,080
by thinking the monkeys moving the arm

1501
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:02,190
and there's

1502
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:07,290
attached to the so the monkey will close the group

1503
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:08,690
and get some

1504
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:09,850
food from

1505
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:14,460
stuff it into his mouth

1506
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:25,330
sorry i don't see anything i see it here

1507
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:29,580
the sun

1508
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:35,370
is that

1509
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:42,790
you seem

1510
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:53,940
one more try

1511
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:57,390
o thing to toss of highway driving

1512
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:01,450
so all of us part of the reason why drivers and what we try to

1513
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:07,790
be automatically trade many different desiderata values of the with other cars and you really

1514
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:11,760
don't want to hit other pedestrians and we don't suggestions maybe you want to maintain

1515
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,890
reasonable speed you don't have separate or break too much useful they want to sell

1516
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:19,750
the blind spot that big truck on the kind of what i don't like tonight's

1517
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:23,570
the curb the matching the curve is not is that it's a pedestrian and you

1518
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:28,400
like to maintain a resource fees early seventies thereafter so

1519
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:32,000
if you think about how you teach six-year-olds to drive what you do not do

1520
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:35,790
is sitting down and say you know he kids this is the reward function go

1521
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:43,220
maximize that what you do instead see that washoe drive for a while and somehow

1522
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:47,900
by this process of washing drive that they somehow figure out maybe what could they

1523
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:52,860
somehow learn to drive for themselves on and so

1524
01:33:52,890 --> 01:33:57,770
to me one question is on if you given out of the demonstration of driving

1525
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:02,710
this is peter driving that car is it possible seven out of figure out how

1526
01:34:02,830 --> 01:34:04,070
drive by itself

1527
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:08,100
OK and i think the fact is even though all of us are pretty decent

1528
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:12,470
drivers is very hard for us to sit down and write out the mathematical equation

1529
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:17,450
saying well this are what function for driving is much more natural to demonstrate driving

1530
01:34:17,450 --> 01:34:20,170
in the urban to what can

1531
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:26,200
there's lots of work on a

1532
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:31,130
learning from from from demonstrations goes on in the imitation learning learning by watching a

1533
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:35,340
few of the names of the major work has has to focus on trying to

1534
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:40,150
predict and express actions as a function of the states and on a lot of

1535
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:45,530
success is i think it often lacks performance guarantees what we do is just described

1536
01:34:45,530 --> 01:34:50,950
different approach those really do the peer review for instance was sphere and those on

1537
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:56,030
something called inverse reinforcement learning and what you can prove is that this approach that

1538
01:34:56,330 --> 01:35:00,770
can learn a control policy with performance is as good as he expect because it's

1539
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:01,960
the demonstrators holes

1540
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:06,830
what you going to evaluate performance according to the expected reward function which by the

1541
01:35:06,830 --> 01:35:10,340
way you is actually impossible to figure out based demonstration

1542
01:35:10,650 --> 01:35:14,530
it turns out to be impossible to figure out what he expects what function is

1543
01:35:14,770 --> 01:35:19,000
but none the less the unknown and unknowable what function you think of our fuzzy

1544
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:22,110
improve would do well on that one function

1545
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:28,780
this may be almost this promotional most technical father to talk but his the idea

1546
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:33,210
of informal you can about having a two thousand justice two things one is you

1547
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:36,100
guess what experts try to guess what the expose reward function

1548
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:41,880
and the intuition is to try to find reward function that makes what we saw

1549
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:45,670
the expertise to the really good and tries to make anything that we manage to

1550
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:50,070
do ourselves the really bad day and then you can formalise this is maximum margin

1551
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:54,620
problem as a quadratic programme next as of the mathematically equivalent to support vector machines

1552
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:59,680
but the idea is key finding a reward function that explains dx this behaviour makes

1553
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:02,390
of cells pretty that makes explicitly

1554
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:06,810
you take the reward function guests and you pretend to write what function the use

1555
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:11,720
of the our problem using this reward function you just guess and then you right

1556
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:16,880
we can prove is that under mild conditions a small number of iterations is our

1557
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:21,940
of open policy that all forms nearly as well as the expert as evaluated on

1558
01:36:21,980 --> 01:36:24,110
the experts

1559
01:36:25,650 --> 01:36:27,530
the especially some examples

1560
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:32,320
on the left is the video that is actually exactly the same video the soldiers

1561
01:36:32,350 --> 01:36:36,510
now of peter demonstrating you know driving the car

1562
01:36:36,610 --> 01:36:41,860
and with no reward function specifies the input the only input the our atmosphere driving

1563
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:47,690
twenty driving that

1564
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:50,510
you know that

1565
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:55,910
this would be more cool three d computer graphics

1566
01:36:55,970 --> 01:37:03,430
so just kind of fun examples on the video left in each of these examples

1567
01:37:03,430 --> 01:37:08,950
and that's the panel shows the driving demonstrations and right panel shows the learned behavior

1568
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:14,830
when only the left panel demonstrations given as input and so this is PD demonstrating

1569
01:37:14,830 --> 01:37:19,200
driving style which he crashes into as many cars as possible

1570
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:21,330
and when you do that

1571
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:31,470
i think these behaviors that may be somewhat visible but challenging to specify mathematically get

1572
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:36,950
on the just and demonstration that's peter stay staying in the right meaning veering off

1573
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:45,400
and for some more

1574
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:11,720
or one

1575
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:19,510
one of these

1576
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:47,630
we are in

1577
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:26,080
it it

1578
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:36,300
four of

1579
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:45,820
this work

1580
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,880
three or five

1581
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:56,300
we were

1582
01:40:56,340 --> 01:41:01,110
are sure

1583
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,570
the game

1584
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:39,170
four years

1585
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:01,740
there are

1586
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:13,740
he throws it will be on

1587
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:11,630
the thing

1588
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:32,310
for each

1589
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:42,390
and even

1590
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:01,780
all kinds of

1591
01:44:01,850 --> 01:44:09,610
so all the first time

1592
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:14,430
very very old

1593
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:22,590
he's not

1594
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,590
over the

1595
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:31,380
this room you must have done OK right

1596
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:32,930
having said that

1597
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:38,560
i have discovered that saying that is misleading and the reason it's misleading is cast

1598
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:42,660
your mind back to ninth grade nine grade math is hard

1599
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:49,560
OK i remember in particular were problems are hard and you remember were problems this

1600
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:52,320
is where you drive from here to cleveland and you fill your tank up with

1601
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:55,520
gas and the gas cost so much per gallon the question is what is your

1602
01:44:55,520 --> 01:45:00,700
shoe size or something and you are but but the way one approaches that is

1603
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:04,920
through kind of common sense approach which involves the fact that many of us have

1604
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:09,080
been in a car driving from city a city b perhaps not cleveland but somewhere

1605
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:13,220
else and so you have a kind of intuition to fall back when you do

1606
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:18,220
the math problems that are logically the same but applied to astrophysical systems for which

1607
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:23,780
you have absolutely no common sense to back you up then you have to reason

1608
01:45:23,780 --> 01:45:28,760
purely from the internal logic of problem and that's hard to do it's a skill

1609
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:30,060
that can be learned

1610
01:45:30,070 --> 01:45:33,000
it's a skill that's worth learning it's a skill that i'm sure many of you

1611
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,490
already have to a large extent but it isn't an easy thing and so the

1612
01:45:37,490 --> 01:45:42,110
fact that the level of the math is low doesn't mean that the problems are

1613
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:49,240
and we do have a lot of help mechanisms which are described perhaps on thursday

1614
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:53,450
to keep you to keep you up to to speed if you start having trouble

1615
01:45:53,450 --> 01:45:54,820
with these things

1616
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:59,410
OK so i should say something about course requirements here let's see

1617
01:45:59,470 --> 01:46:04,410
we have sections in this class these sections are not just problem solving sections these

1618
01:46:04,410 --> 01:46:10,110
are actually required the fact that we're dealing in topics for which the answer is

1619
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:14,840
not fully known means that one can actually have discussion sections unlike many science courses

1620
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:18,270
so we're going to do that and so the structure of the courses like history

1621
01:46:18,270 --> 01:46:22,740
course two lectures which was required section and so ten percent of your great comes

1622
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:27,400
from sections a large fraction of that is just showing up but they will also

1623
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:32,790
be something in terms of you know saying something intelligent what you get there

1624
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:36,410
that's ten percent of the course thirty percent of the courses problem sets we'll have

1625
01:46:36,410 --> 01:46:40,860
these things at once a week the first problem set will show up on thursday

1626
01:46:41,230 --> 01:46:45,120
and if you have any question about whether this course is appropriate for you the

1627
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:49,080
right thing to do is to look at that problem set and ask yourself is

1628
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,190
this reasonable i will say

1629
01:46:51,110 --> 01:46:54,960
the students on their evaluation to pointed out that it does the course does get

1630
01:46:54,960 --> 01:47:00,830
harder it's not the math gets more complicated but the situations get more complicated and

1631
01:47:00,830 --> 01:47:05,770
so if you have serious trouble with the first problems that that's probably a warning

1632
01:47:05,770 --> 01:47:09,470
sign as i say that will be handed out on thursday these things come about

1633
01:47:09,470 --> 01:47:14,800
once week thirty percent of the great also more about problems sets later on thursday

1634
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:18,150
the thirty percent come from two mid-term exams the way we do this is the

1635
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:21,580
one where you get the better score counts twenty percent one that you get the

1636
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:24,890
worst score counts ten percent so they give you a little bit of a break

1637
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:27,890
and then there will be a final exam that's the last thirty percent of the

1638
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:32,910
there is also an optional paper if you choose to do that that will count

1639
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:37,230
fifteen percent of your great and what it will do is it will d-wade whichever

1640
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:42,170
the worst of you're thirty percent part of your grade are back down to fifteen

1641
01:47:42,170 --> 01:47:48,090
percent so if you're a word person rather than a number person you get this

1642
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:52,650
opportunity to to augment your score and d d-wade

1643
01:47:52,670 --> 01:47:57,530
some other part of the class in which you may have done well as well

1644
01:47:57,610 --> 01:48:02,580
all this stuff is on the classes server i should say that the syllabus that

1645
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:07,110
i put out here is just a direct copy of what's on the classes server

1646
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:13,890
so feel free to to take that but all the information and actually more information

1647
01:48:13,970 --> 01:48:16,590
is is online

1648
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:18,690
let me

1649
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:24,880
oppose now ask whether there are questions about the course and the course procedures

1650
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,460
no no this class is going to be now

1651
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:48,700
i'll have to check and see what you were thinking of but it may be

1652
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:52,270
that what that was referring to was section times actually this is something that i

1653
01:48:52,270 --> 01:48:56,370
have mentioned sections are required they're all going to be on mondays we're going to

1654
01:48:56,370 --> 01:49:00,770
have a wide range of times all of them on mondays from twelve thirty two

1655
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:04,470
i think eighty nine but you do have to sign up for section let me

1656
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:05,470
also say

1657
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:09,740
i've i've mentioned here i don't think this is actually looking at the number of

1658
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:13,780
people here i think we're going to be able to accommodate everyone including including juniors

1659
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:17,890
and seniors but i did set up in such a way that freshmen and sophomores

1660
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:22,500
get first crack the way that can work is set this section the online section

1661
01:49:22,570 --> 01:49:25,690
form opens up on mondays on monday

1662
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:31,240
and juniors and seniors won't be allowed to officially register for the class until tuesday

1663
01:49:31,270 --> 01:49:36,140
so the freshmen sophomores get to fill up the sections first my guess is again

1664
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:38,860
looking at the number of people here today that we want to have any problem

1665
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:40,690
and then if you're junior senior

1666
01:49:40,790 --> 01:49:43,560
you'll you'll get on just fine

1667
01:49:43,690 --> 01:49:49,640
and so will be picking sections through the through what is now the standard online

1668
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:52,240
times the dimension times the rank

1669
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:56,990
and input to be extremely precisely two times dimension mind answering time the rank but

1670
01:49:56,990 --> 01:50:00,950
the point is that if n is one million and the rank stand for example

1671
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:03,080
the number of degrees of freedom

1672
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:07,780
of the matrix of rank ten in dimension one million is something like twenty million

1673
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:09,850
not one trillion

1674
01:50:09,870 --> 01:50:11,460
which is an square

1675
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:14,570
and so of course the matrix of rank r depends on the number of degrees

1676
01:50:14,570 --> 01:50:18,520
of freedom which is much smaller than n square which is the ambient dimension

1677
01:50:18,530 --> 01:50:22,890
and so this ask begs the question was well if this matrix depends on the

1678
01:50:22,910 --> 01:50:24,640
small number of degrees of freedom

1679
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:26,830
you i really need to see everything two

1680
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:29,580
recovers the matrix exactly

1681
01:50:29,870 --> 01:50:33,480
and the question is not as easy as it seems

1682
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:37,920
so here's an example of the very simple matrix of rank one

1683
01:50:38,570 --> 01:50:40,010
as you can see

1684
01:50:40,030 --> 01:50:43,220
this matrix is based by multiplying the

1685
01:50:44,530 --> 01:50:49,420
basis vector was the last that symmetric which is full of zero except that there's

1686
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:51,200
the one in some corner right

1687
01:50:52,430 --> 01:50:53,580
and if suppose

1688
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:56,410
i show i'm going use gray says

1689
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:58,990
if you don't mind

1690
01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:04,290
if i show fifty percent of the entries to grace at random fifty percent of

1691
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:06,860
the time she will see zero

1692
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:10,200
and so when you see zero is no way for you to tell me that

1693
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,260
this matrix is not zero matrix

1694
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:15,510
so you have an example of a matrix are very low rank

1695
01:51:15,530 --> 01:51:18,750
and even if you look at a few i given a ninety percent of the

1696
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:23,460
entries ten percent of the time just zero and you will never guess there's one

1697
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:24,820
right here

1698
01:51:24,830 --> 01:51:30,130
and these matrices cannot be recovered from one percent of the entries or even ninety

1699
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:33,500
percent of the entries just not possible

1700
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:37,450
OK but this matrix is a little bit peculiar and certainly the netflix matrix does

1701
01:51:37,450 --> 01:51:41,640
not look like this because images fixed images look like this i would say

1702
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:46,550
there's one guy that likes one movie and everybody else dislikes

1703
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:51,480
then on the other hand you have also to be careful with what i decided

1704
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:52,510
to show you

1705
01:51:52,610 --> 01:51:57,690
so suppose we have a rank one matrix which is simply an outer product between

1706
01:51:57,690 --> 01:51:59,550
two vectors x and y

1707
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:04,180
then the entries of m is simply excite times y j

1708
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:08,670
and suppose that i should grace everything except

1709
01:52:08,690 --> 01:52:11,400
roy manual so let's say this is

1710
01:52:11,710 --> 01:52:17,560
again the netflix database and she gets to see everything the preferences of all users

1711
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:21,660
for all movies except she knows nothing about man

1712
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:25,710
well how can she predicting that she doesn't even know how it looks like OK

1713
01:52:26,450 --> 01:52:28,190
of course if i forget

1714
01:52:28,210 --> 01:52:32,450
if i don't sample row or column even if you have the same press matrix

1715
01:52:32,650 --> 01:52:34,080
a matrix of rank one

1716
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:36,550
matrix completion is not possible

1717
01:52:36,630 --> 01:52:41,820
so of course these are very peculiar sample set so we can assume that way

1718
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:46,110
the set of entries that you get to see example at random not because i

1719
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:51,880
believe in probability but i'm interested in describing what happens most of the time and

1720
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:55,110
not in the worst possible case

1721
01:52:55,830 --> 01:52:56,680
so now

1722
01:52:56,690 --> 01:53:01,250
we arrive at an interesting point which is that if the matrix is not adversarial

1723
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:03,790
with the one in accordance are everywhere else

1724
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:09,970
is something said is random that is it's not constructed in the village way perhaps

1725
01:53:09,970 --> 01:53:14,210
there is one low rank matrix which is completed which is consistent with the sampled

1726
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:20,380
right so perhaps there is one only one low rank matrix that fits the data

1727
01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:24,370
and this is the case then i would recovery by just

1728
01:53:24,370 --> 01:53:29,100
minimizing the rank of the matrix subject to the constraints

1729
01:53:29,110 --> 01:53:32,630
but i want to say that this point that it's just i hope that we

1730
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:35,820
don't know whether there is only one rank matrix and even if i were to

1731
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:40,710
give you data and i say how many matrices of rank seventeen are consistent with

1732
01:53:40,710 --> 01:53:41,690
this data

1733
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:45,980
then to decide this is already already NP complete

1734
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,710
but we could dream and say well you know we have enough data

1735
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:51,920
and the data is not adversarial

1736
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:55,580
so maybe this is just one or a matrix that is consistent with this data

1737
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:57,650
and which cases will work

1738
01:53:57,670 --> 01:54:03,800
the problem with this is that minimizing the rank subject to linear equality constraints is

1739
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:06,370
NP hard and in fact

1740
01:54:06,390 --> 01:54:10,750
yesterday we talked about the hardness of minimising zero zero norm

1741
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:14,200
well if you think the minimising of the one norm is hard

1742
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:18,310
then i have news for you that minimizing the rank is much harder

1743
01:54:18,330 --> 01:54:22,410
and to the best of my knowledge i think the best are reason we know

1744
01:54:22,450 --> 01:54:23,910
to minimize the rank

1745
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:28,330
is as the complexity which is doubly exponential in n that is we can do

1746
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:30,100
is n equals five maybe

1747
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:33,490
but cannot do any calls eight

1748
01:54:33,550 --> 01:54:34,470
all right

1749
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:37,960
so even if this made sense there's is no way we can do it in

1750
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:39,110
the computer

1751
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:42,170
so instead we're going to do is we get

1752
01:54:42,190 --> 01:54:46,020
so the convex guy so we can relax this problem it is something that we

1753
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:47,540
can solve

1754
01:54:48,350 --> 01:54:51,110
i'd like to introduce the nuclear norm

1755
01:54:51,130 --> 01:54:54,940
and the nuclear norm is simply the sum of the singular values is the nuclear

1756
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:58,130
norm of a matrix is very simple definition

1757
01:54:58,150 --> 01:55:01,100
it is the sum of the singular values of the matrix it's not clear that

1758
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:06,390
it's the norm example is not clear that it obeys the triangular inequality busy day

1759
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:08,380
so now i'm going to replace

1760
01:55:09,620 --> 01:55:14,160
rank functional by the nuclear norm phenomena as to minimize the nuclear norm subjective data

1761
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:20,940
constraints because i have norm then the objective function or becomes convex and the

1762
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,720
and the

1763
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:26,700
and and since i have convex constraints and looking at the convex optimisation problem

1764
01:55:26,730 --> 01:55:31,430
and in fact it's just not any convex optimisation problem it's a problem that is

1765
01:55:31,430 --> 01:55:32,630
kind of

1766
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:38,100
closely related to the rank in the sense that it is the tightest convex approximation

1767
01:55:38,110 --> 01:55:41,300
two the rank optimisation problems

1768
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:42,660
and so

1769
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:46,910
the way we should understand the one norm minimisation is this which is that if

1770
01:55:46,910 --> 01:55:48,170
i look at

1771
01:55:48,180 --> 01:55:50,970
i hope you can see this picture if i can look if i look at

1772
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:55,450
all the vectors that have one nonzero components

1773
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:58,860
of size plus or minus one

1774
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:02,200
so the signal that i extremely sparse

1775
01:56:02,210 --> 01:56:04,220
then they are on this

1776
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:10,660
and what the l one ball is it's essentially is the convex hull of this

1777
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:14,220
point that it is the smallest convex bodies

1778
01:56:14,230 --> 01:56:18,740
that contains extremely sparse vectors

1779
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:21,220
and there is no smaller

1780
01:56:21,230 --> 01:56:23,990
convex bodies it contains

1781
01:56:24,010 --> 01:56:28,770
this very sparse vectors and just the same now i cannot draw a picture but

1782
01:56:28,770 --> 01:56:30,390
just the same

1783
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:34,010
if you look at the simplest object according to the rank well this will be

1784
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:36,500
wink one matrices

1785
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:40,790
OK and now suppose to normalize them such that their spectral norm is one and

1786
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:43,420
you ask what is the convex

1787
01:56:43,430 --> 01:56:48,160
how of all this point that is what is the smallest convex set that contains

1788
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:53,370
rank one matrices we use

1789
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:58,830
as a precise balance on the spectral norm and that happens to be the nuclear

1790
01:56:58,830 --> 01:57:03,330
norm since sense just as the l one ball nor is the tightest relaxation the

1791
01:57:03,330 --> 01:57:06,460
tightest convex approximation to the l one norm

1792
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:09,620
i see zero preceded by one

1793
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:13,060
many times i see a one preceded by

1794
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:16,140
a one and so on you do all those counts and he

1795
01:57:16,170 --> 01:57:19,680
maximized by

1796
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:21,550
so those a simple

1797
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:25,530
markov models which just correspond to changes

1798
01:57:25,550 --> 01:57:26,980
in space

1799
01:57:27,010 --> 01:57:34,100
and you can make these models in the same way you meant to say a

1800
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:39,200
density estimation model to turn it into a classification model you can that these models

1801
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:40,660
with imports

1802
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:43,160
so instead of having

1803
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:45,930
just this chain of models

1804
01:57:45,950 --> 01:57:49,710
the go like this you can also have some inputs

1805
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:53,180
in each of these nodes

1806
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:57,260
get what you get

1807
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:59,650
for features

1808
01:58:01,790 --> 01:58:05,630
what this says is that says about of this note here

1809
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:12,050
doesn't just on its parents but also on some input from the world

1810
01:58:12,050 --> 01:58:14,830
so you can think of these things may be labels

1811
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:18,610
OK so in a sentence so that each one of these corresponds to words in

1812
01:58:20,570 --> 01:58:21,860
these are

1813
01:58:21,870 --> 01:58:27,260
part of speech tags this is the noun verb or some kind of function words

1814
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:30,140
like predicates something

1815
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:34,100
and this is one model can be used to do part of speech tagging and

1816
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:36,430
sentence and the assumption here is that

1817
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:41,720
when you're in and a verb or predicate it depends on what the previous work

1818
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:44,650
was because he has this very strong

1819
01:58:45,850 --> 01:58:51,480
but it also depends on something some observation make locally like maybe the morphology of

1820
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:53,600
the words or

1821
01:58:53,610 --> 01:58:57,690
some other aspects of the the sentence that you want as input

1822
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:01,840
so maybe if the word ends in e g

1823
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:06,440
that might be signal that you're you know very likely to be observed

1824
01:59:06,450 --> 01:59:10,600
so that would be an example of some bottom-up inputs and you also have this

1825
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:14,890
the level of of markovian models

1826
01:59:14,910 --> 01:59:17,280
so this structure here

1827
01:59:17,310 --> 01:59:22,260
is called a maximum entropy markov model

1828
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:30,360
and anything using a lot of sequential labeling tasks including information extraction and part of

1829
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:34,370
speech tagging and labeling images and things like that

1830
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:37,110
so you can think of this model in two ways you can think this model

1831
01:59:37,110 --> 01:59:39,590
is a markov model

1832
01:59:39,590 --> 01:59:42,030
where we had up bottom up there

1833
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:44,710
it features the bias the markov model

1834
01:59:44,730 --> 01:59:49,190
or you can think of it as a classification model

1835
01:59:49,210 --> 01:59:53,120
where we have a temporal dependencies between the classes

1836
01:59:53,810 --> 01:59:56,960
classification of i give the inputs and you have the class

1837
01:59:57,010 --> 01:59:59,040
and it is making decision at each

1838
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:04,290
o point independently but here in the class the you decide four point two

1839
02:00:04,830 --> 02:00:08,320
depends on the class size for data point one you can think of it as

1840
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:09,800
a classification model

1841
02:00:09,850 --> 02:00:11,800
query string

1842
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:15,920
you can also

1843
02:00:15,980 --> 02:00:21,100
you can also consider an undirected version of this model which is called a conditional

1844
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:22,690
random field

1845
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:29,680
i conditional random fields

1846
02:00:29,710 --> 02:00:34,020
this is different from the maximum entropy model and the fact that the normalisation of

1847
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:38,070
these distributions is global and local

1848
02:00:38,110 --> 02:00:42,020
and you can look at this and figure out that have to do with pairs

1849
02:00:43,390 --> 02:00:47,070
adjacent labels and pairs of inputs so

1850
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:51,610
this is another kind of all that can be used to to model changes when

1851
02:00:51,610 --> 02:00:54,550
you have some labels at the top and some the inputs

1852
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:56,240
of all

1853
02:00:56,270 --> 02:01:00,130
OK so change is a very simple

1854
02:01:00,190 --> 02:01:05,370
kind of model which extends these two models to a richer structure

1855
02:01:05,410 --> 02:01:08,850
and in the next step beyond change

1856
02:01:08,850 --> 02:01:12,640
party considered directed tree models

1857
02:01:12,670 --> 02:01:17,610
so i directed trees are basically graphical models

1858
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:23,030
in which each variable has exactly one other variable as parents

1859
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:26,760
except a special node called the root which has no

1860
02:01:26,830 --> 02:01:31,810
intuitively remind you can think of trees as that is

1861
02:01:31,830 --> 02:01:34,630
with no explaining away

1862
02:01:34,650 --> 02:01:39,550
remember explaining away occurs when you have a single node that has more than one

1863
02:01:42,090 --> 02:01:43,770
and then when observe this

1864
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:47,630
these parents become couple in the inference

1865
02:01:47,650 --> 02:01:52,890
but it really we explicitly said so every node has exactly one parent and so

1866
02:01:52,890 --> 02:01:54,920
there never any explaining away

1867
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:59,440
and that lack of explaining away next morning please very very

1868
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:07,380
so the trees are sort of the next logical step up from assuming independence between

1869
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:08,840
the nodes

1870
02:02:08,850 --> 02:02:12,530
so you have a huge number of nodes in the graphical model

1871
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:13,800
and ask you

1872
02:02:13,810 --> 02:02:16,090
what these are the most

1873
02:02:16,110 --> 02:02:20,480
factorized something you could make it independent no links at all the graph each node

1874
02:02:20,490 --> 02:02:22,060
is just as distribution

1875
02:02:22,070 --> 02:02:25,880
and as you what the next most general thing you could do

1876
02:02:25,900 --> 02:02:28,450
the next month's general thing may be changed

1877
02:02:28,470 --> 02:02:33,320
pick an one ordering of the random variables and arrange them change the really you

1878
02:02:33,320 --> 02:02:37,990
should think of it as the truth that reconsiders the variables as parents

1879
02:02:38,010 --> 02:02:40,460
instead of just in isolation in

1880
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:42,670
each pairwise

1881
02:02:42,670 --> 02:02:48,260
all of

1882
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:57,710
so that

1883
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:16,130
well you know

1884
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:27,100
the end of the

1885
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:16,300
on the boat
