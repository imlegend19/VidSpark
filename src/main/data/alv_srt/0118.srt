1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,050
well i have been attacked by a friendly frequencies

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,860
but i survived

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,710
because obviously things are

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:17,610
more involved than that and i apologize for simplifying the frequentist view in this way

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,750
so of course there are ways of deriving certain estimators and i was a bit

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,400
sloppy in that respect so in the second part of this lecture i would like

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:33,010
to give you an example of how we're bayesian methodology can be used in practice

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,690
and the example that i'm using is writing and matchmaking and this is a joint

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,080
work with ralf herbrich

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,510
and it's it's published so far

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:52,240
and this is a serious application as you know i'm working for microsoft and the

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,230
inspiration for this work

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:01,070
came from some of the employees at microsoft research taking part in beta testing for

14
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,330
halo two

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,200
and what happened was that several thousand employees at microsoft where

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,920
we were asked to participate in this test to test the online playing in halo

17
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,250
two and everyone was very happy to do that of course

18
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,100
i felt privileged over the rest of the world was a lot of fun in

19
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,820
this period and we also found a lot of

20
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,860
ways to improve the game but of course when we looked at our rankings and

21
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:38,390
other systems which became very suspicious because it appears that were only average players why

22
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,450
we need for ourselves that we were really the top of the world

23
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,950
we instantly knew that their system must be flawed in some way and we offer

24
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,980
them our advice

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,930
and from then on we also developed a new system which was not just a

26
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,840
slight modification of theirs but is trying to to do this from being starting from

27
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,640
bayesian principles so

28
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:15,100
i'll give you a short overview for this part i'll talk about the general idea

29
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,340
of playwriting in video games and then show you how our system works we

30
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,690
call it the mu sigma system for

31
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,350
various reasons

32
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,720
i want to talk a little bit about alternative rating systems and give you some

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:38,460
numerical results on some of those beta data maybe one question other chess players among

34
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,280
us and is there anyone who has an elo rating

35
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,720
other chess players

36
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,800
a little bit but not enough to have an either writing or

37
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,000
so you know this is the writing system that was developed by a particular for

38
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,230
and from which we took a lot of inspiration and which then would turn out

39
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,600
to be a special case of this system

40
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,570
as i said would

41
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:14,900
personal motivation was this particular game but there's also a real interest to improve service

42
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,660
for people and in particular there are now online services like x-box live where people

43
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,220
have the game attacked is essentially the name online and they can look into the

44
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,820
system and play various games on the system always with the same tag if you

45
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,070
can talk to each other and in particular interesting for this thing statistics are collected

46
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:41,060
about these players and there's service called up to match

47
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:47,840
and after much tries to find people in the world who could play together very

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,320
well you know everyone's online and the question is if we have to arrange games

49
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,960
who would like to put into the same game and there are various criteria that

50
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,610
we have to meet here one thing is we want to good network connection between

51
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,690
the people because otherwise there would be lag in the game the packages wouldn't arrive

52
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:10,460
quickly enough to make for fun and realistic game and the things that people want

53
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:15,000
to seem to set up but the most important for this up to match thing

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,570
is really that you have a good rating system so you can get people together

55
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,150
into games such that the game outcome is unclear from the beginning and the game

56
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,190
so here you can see here the typical structure of

57
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,570
network packets

58
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,730
so it

59
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,640
very very abstract level consists of two important part

60
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,650
so one of them is the head

61
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:42,440
which represents carries information from network and the

62
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,550
transport layer protocol so

63
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,160
for example IP TCP protocol and information in this had user has a fixed

64
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,980
it means that you know what few has which information

65
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,350
certain by have

66
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,150
address information IP address and port so this information really very easy to access

67
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,710
that's why the first idea first approach to network intrusion detection was

68
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,120
sort extract

69
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,490
flat file features fixed set of features

70
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,740
from the side information

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,760
readily available

72
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,930
the problem with that

73
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,150
is that

74
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,960
most of attacks

75
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,890
really use valid

76
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,670
so in order to deliver an attacked to target computer one has to

77
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,170
the user protocol in valid way

78
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,870
is going to have valid ity addressed

79
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,670
it is going to have some

80
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,050
valid combination of

81
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,170
TCP flags set

82
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,580
and in the case where doesn't use a very simple method to prevent such

83
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,190
there are some kind of attacks that use them

84
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,010
in funny sequence of packets

85
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,880
but they can be very easily detected by the network configuration

86
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,380
the result of the intrusion detection system that uses had information usually

87
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,870
very mediocre

88
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,090
and the classical

89
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,120
example of

90
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,140
this dataset is no

91
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,060
to use this information is the so-called KDD cup ninety nine years

92
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,640
back in the

93
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,480
late nineties people have already thought about applying

94
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,020
machine learning techniques and abilities

95
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,010
datasets for KDD competition

96
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,310
the performance of the best not was acceptable but not for computers here

97
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,700
in order to really be able

98
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,020
to detect dangerous

99
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,890
and dangerous that is using some application abilities one has to be able to analyse

100
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,510
and there are several ways to do this

101
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:04,690
the simplest way is to consider payload as a sequence of robot

102
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,160
an advantage of this is that one can

103
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,420
you can see that the

104
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:21,380
the way exploit that has some suspicious by sequence and one might try to

105
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,100
constructing features from those by sequences

106
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,610
the second

107
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,390
so the advantage also is that

108
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,850
this page is relatively easy to come up with and it does not require any

109
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,750
knowledge of the application protocol that run

110
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,080
was taken by students don't care

111
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,920
what applications running whether they should be piece of

112
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,160
piece of what

113
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,920
the cell easy to actually

114
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,550
processes information

115
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,010
another possibility is pass but so you can

116
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:52,800
you can do

117
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,420
i tried to build a particle passes dust a syntactic and semantic information

118
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,910
this is more time consuming but to get some more informative features

119
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,630
also it is possible to come up with

120
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,650
another kind of flat features

121
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,730
basically you some extra information from the application of

122
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,730
this might be

123
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,050
perhaps the most preferable approach but again utilised their ability

124
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,750
this would be very time consuming process analyse the feature

125
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,060
so this is usually

126
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,910
not done in the field

127
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,860
i will show you how to deal with by

128
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,410
sequential features using by sequences

129
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,630
and the key idea here is

130
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,230
you get the idea that

131
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,400
it also

132
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:51,470
the known machine learning community is that the sequences into a metric space

133
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,570
one can do this by using

134
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,610
language models

135
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:04,110
a simple language model and around the world of words and grounds

136
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,480
one can also unconventional defined

137
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,880
any language

138
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,830
that is generated by

139
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,300
the available also

140
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,080
so out bodies in this case two hundred fifty six

141
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,350
by values

142
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,080
they consider the set of all possible worlds from the alphabet

143
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,920
then you select so we define the language is a subset of the alphabet

144
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,640
you are

145
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,820
essentially defines some function

146
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,370
every world

147
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,730
in this language

148
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,450
into some dimension

149
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,990
so you can see for example

150
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:43,060
it takes three key words from

151
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,920
the foreground galaxy

152
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,600
get the space and you know this twenty four percent five

153
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,150
you'll see that

154
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,780
these points have been built

155
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,410
interesting data structures one can eventually traced back to

156
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,060
some features of the protocol

157
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,690
you can also see

158
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,000
the data points colored by

159
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,920
so the blue points on all the points in the the two examples of tag

160
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,640
these features carefully chosen

161
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,870
can be really very

162
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,920
discriminative for certain factors

163
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,200
for example

164
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,600
the kind of exploit that use the use in the end of the war

165
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,400
very spread out

166
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,630
two thousand four

167
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,060
so you can see that

168
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,910
here and here where the phosphate is just jumps over the state

169
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:44,320
and this hydrolysis spontaneously we get this molecule right over here fossil you know pi

170
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,670
pi pyruvate

171
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,590
at the end

172
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,920
and once again we harvest two

173
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,430
eighty piece

174
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,730
one ATP from each of the trials is

175
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,510
and we end up at the end of this reaction with pyro pyruvate and you'll

176
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,990
say this is terrific because we invested two ATP is

177
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,730
we harvested for

178
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:10,500
plus we got six from the NADH is right

179
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,890
two NADH is each NADH gives us three each so let's do the arithmetic

180
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,110
how much should we let's do the balance sheet

181
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,030
we investigate to begin with

182
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,230
with the with the one because we invested two ATP

183
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,420
that was early on

184
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,610
the return was

185
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,760
the first two

186
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,620
NADH is

187
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,030
which i've told you

188
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,310
equals six ATP

189
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,530
because NADH is worth

190
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,020
three ATP

191
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,270
this is so far good and now

192
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,530
we've gotten

193
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,240
subsequently we made for ATP ATP's

194
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,670
so that the

195
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,210
the net yield

196
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,580
looks pretty

197
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,300
six plus fours ten minus two

198
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,130
a profit of eight ATP one glucose molecule this is terrific

199
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,290
you may say

200
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,470
but this around

201
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,700
there's a catch

202
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,950
like if glycolysis

203
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,920
is occurring in the absence of oxygen

204
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,740
in the absence of oxygen

205
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,710
if that happens then we have a problem here

206
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,980
because the only way

207
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,810
these NADH is can generate ATP

208
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,360
is it there's oxygen around

209
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,180
to take these

210
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,680
electron pairs

211
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,510
and use them to reduce oxygen molecule that is by the way part of the

212
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,640
reason we bring

213
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,860
keep in mind when you generate NADH from eighty molecule you need to regenerate the

214
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,500
energy you can just accumulate more and more and the the ages you need to

215
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,970
regenerate the eighty

216
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,840
and do

217
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:56,750
and therefore this NADH with the electron pairs

218
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,700
they the electron pairs have somehow to be disposed of

219
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,990
you have to regenerate any do you get just make more and more and more

220
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,610
of this so how cells get rid of it

221
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,320
well how they get rid of simple you take the electron pairs and you slap

222
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,860
them on the oxygen

223
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:17,090
and that's really called combustion and you get a lot of energy out of that

224
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:23,130
but what happens if all of this is happening happening is occurring anaerobic lee

225
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:32,900
and typically means the reactions occurring in the absence of oxygen

226
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,710
well if you have a yeast that's growing fourteen feet underground

227
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,900
this is happening in real quickly if you have a nice used the fermenting in

228
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,300
a big cake to make wine or beer it's also probably happening anaerobic lee if

229
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,890
you start running in a hundred yards sprint

230
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,250
then or let's so you run a mile

231
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,510
then initially there's little there's enough oxygen

232
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,890
there's a lot of oxygen around two to allow you to get rid of these

233
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,580
NADH is

234
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,110
and on the electrons that they have acquired

235
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,970
on the the oxygen molecules and that's fine that's worth a lot because in effect

236
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,560
what you're doing is you're taking her oxygen and hydrogen you're combusting them together and

237
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,480
that's great

238
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,300
but as you start running down the street

239
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,450
so the oxygen supply your muscles

240
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,220
is going to run out

241
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:26,030
and soon a lot of the energy production in your muscles

242
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,510
happens anaerobic y

243
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,460
because you can get oxygen quickly enough to your muscles

244
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,380
and therefore for a period of time you start feeling that burning sensation in your

245
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,010
because the oxidation of

246
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:47,470
of NADH isn't happening and these NADH is instead are used or regenerated

247
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,250
by another way how are they were generated

248
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:54,790
the electron pairs of the DNA the ages must be

249
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,960
are dumped back on two

250
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,960
this molecule right here my roommate

251
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,220
they not used to make ATP because they can be used to make ATP because

252
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,460
there's no oxygen around

253
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,780
two accept the electron pairs of these NADH is have required

254
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,940
so what happens with these valuable NADH is

255
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,490
under anaerobic conditions

256
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,240
this doesn't happen

257
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:25,450
these NADH is are used instead electrons are donated to our friend pyruvate here

258
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,580
two but i these are the three carbon sugar and what happens

259
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,860
when they donated back to the power of eight

260
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,840
in order to regenerate any do you need more energy to pick up to use

261
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,790
later in the reaction to use what all over again another reaction when you donate

262
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,660
electrons from NADH back on the power of a what happens

263
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,880
you get lactic acid

264
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,500
lactic acid is what makes your muscles burn

265
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,380
when you're you're running very quickly and you can't get enough oxygen into them to

266
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,280
begin to burn up

267
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,930
the NADH

268
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,950
so instead of using NADH to generate ATP etc diverted

269
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,710
to make lactic acid that in one sense good because you regenerate NADE

270
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,910
why do you need to regenerate eighty

271
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,220
because you need a lot of energy around

272
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,620
for the earlier steps in the reaction

273
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,320
keep in mind early in the reaction

274
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:23,320
where is our friend and early action you need a here

275
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,360
if you know we generated than glycolysis grinds to a halt

276
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,170
so even though you make NADH and it's a good thing in principle in practice

277
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,340
it has to be recycled and it's not recycle to make more new energy to

278
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:44,210
allow the step to happen the whole likely reaction will shut down and you're mass

279
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,030
however sadly

280
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,050
in the absence of oxygen

281
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,280
the only way to recycle this is to dump these electrons not the oxygen which

282
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,110
what does that have on

283
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,490
one more

284
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:44,350
all of

285
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,760
we want to

286
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,870
thank you

287
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,980
you will

288
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:58,070
you of

289
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,550
well i

290
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,990
number of

291
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,820
one of

292
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,430
OK for all

293
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,620
the problem

294
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,580
all they

295
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:03,550
i believe

296
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,340
we either

297
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,410
they all

298
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,480
o point

299
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,000
the square is always positive and therefore i could not get the answer zero

300
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,640
but in the other cases i might get the answer zero and the theorem is

301
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,010
you always do

302
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,460
why is this well

303
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,500
i'm asking you there are three ways to prove this it's like many fundamental facts

304
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:57,110
in mathematics are different ways of going about

305
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,990
by the way along with the theorems i probably should have included so

306
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,280
i'm far away

307
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,990
we might as well include because we're going to need

308
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,770
what happens if you

309
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,890
use the same function if i take you equal to be in that case that

310
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,940
indicate he will not going to get the answer zero but what you will get

311
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,890
is so in other words i'm just asking what is the sign of entity

312
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,050
that's the case where two of them of the same

313
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,630
i use the same function

314
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,470
what's that

315
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,510
well the answer is it's the same as what you will get if you integrate

316
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,980
the cosine

317
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:43,570
because i swear and t

318
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,530
and the answer to either one of these is

319
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,330
that's something you know how to do from eighteen o one

320
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,370
or the equivalent thereof you know you

321
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,060
you can integrate size square is one of the things that learned for the whatever

322
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,770
exactly to that of integration

323
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,500
anyway so i'm not going to calculate this out the answer turns out to be

324
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,140
all right

325
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,690
the ways to prove that are

326
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,260
you can use trig identities

327
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,410
and i'm asking you in one of the

328
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,890
early problems and the problems

329
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,190
i invented scenes

330
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:33,440
identities for the product of sine cosine expressing it in a form which is easy

331
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,620
to integrate

332
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,060
and you can prove it that way

333
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,580
or you can use if you forgot the trigonometric identities and want to get some

334
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,210
more exercise conflict you can use complex exponentials

335
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,200
so i'm asking you to have

336
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:52,510
in another part of the same problem i'm asking you to do it do one

337
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,930
of these at any rate using complex exponentials

338
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,380
and now i'm going to use the mysterious third method

339
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:05,110
another way use i'm going to use the older e

340
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,540
i'm going to do that

341
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:14,720
because this is the method it's not just size and cosines which are orthogonal there

342
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:18,880
masses of orthogonal functions out there

343
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,690
and the way they are discovered in the way you prove they are orthogonal

344
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,920
it is not with trig identities and complex exponential because there's only work with size

345
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,190
and cosines

346
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:34,050
it is instead with by going back to the differential equation that they solve and

347
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:38,260
that's therefore the method you don't use here

348
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:43,340
because this is the method which generalizes the many other differential equations other than the

349
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,510
simple one satisfied by size and cosine

350
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,190
but anyway that is the source

351
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,830
so the way the proof of these orthogonality condition got so i'm not going to

352
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,980
do that and i song and i'm also going so i'm going to assume that

353
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:04,120
m is different from and so that i'm not in either of these two cases

354
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:10,950
what it depends on is what's the differential equation that all these functions satisfy well

355
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,960
the different differential equations depending on

356
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,380
the value of n but

357
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,910
they look essentially the same

358
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,170
these satisfy

359
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,290
the differential equation

360
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:29,840
now that's what they have in common the differential equation is

361
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,670
let's let's call you

362
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,840
it looks better

363
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,090
it's going to look better

364
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,440
if you let me call you

365
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,360
double prime

366
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,200
he was

367
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,390
well i mean square so

368
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:49,000
functions assigning to cosine

369
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:56,130
satisfy you double prime was and square time you know was the frequency is then

370
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,110
and therefore this is the square of the frequency is what you would here equals

371
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:06,970
in other words what these functions have in common

372
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:11,580
is that they satisfy the differential equation looks like that and the only thing is

373
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,930
allowed to vary

374
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,890
is the frequency

375
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
which is allowed to change

376
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,950
the frequency is is in this coefficient you

377
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,950
now the remarkable thing is that all you need to know

378
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,980
the fact that they satisfy the differential equations

379
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:35,580
that's all you need to know to prove the orthogonality relations

380
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:47,490
OK let's try to do it

381
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,470
well i need some notation so i'm going to live

382
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,580
and the

383
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,790
any two

384
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,200
one of the functions

385
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,190
in other words

386
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:06,910
i also in that m is different from anchorage sample

387
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:11,460
this one could be signed entity and that could be sign of m t

388
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,880
or this could be sign entity and that could be cosine of mt you get

389
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,810
the idea

390
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,990
any two of those in the subscript indicates whether what the end with the is

391
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,200
that are in that

392
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,280
any two

393
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,930
and i mean really two distinct well if i say that m is not and

394
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:34,950
then they positively have to be different so i again it's overkill with my tools

395
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,140
in this

396
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:42,250
and what i'm going to calculate well first of all from the equation i'm going

397
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,960
to write equation this way

398
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,460
it says that you double prime

399
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,640
is equal to

400
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,210
minus and square you

401
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,240
that's true for any of these guys

402
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,880
of course here would be

403
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,380
the double prime is equal to minus m squared

404
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,760
times v

405
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,040
you have to make those simple adjustments

406
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,760
and now what we're going to calculate is

407
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,960
from minus on a

408
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,280
paul i

409
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,560
and in

410
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,290
double prime

411
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,150
defines the

412
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,480
the team

413
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,280
what does

414
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,430
there with

415
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,080
why am i going to do that i can't explain why do that won't ask

416
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,840
me the question five

417
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:47,710
now the point is this is highly on symmetric

418
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:52,970
you use differentiated twice the years so those two functions but there is a way

419
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,440
of turning them into an expression with a

420
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,130
which looks extremely symmetric where

421
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,070
it turn

422
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,480
the same amount

423
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,540
the way to do that is i want to get rid of one of these

424
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:10,950
primes here and put one on here way to do that is

425
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,050
it's a great

426
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,490
is mostly up to now i've talked about

427
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,910
first order methods are methods that are not even first order

428
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,950
newton method is where you go one more time out in the taylor series

429
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,300
to you had on the quadratic term and you try to pick your the next

430
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:32,160
year by minimizing an approximation to the second order taylor series

431
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:39,020
in the classic method hk is exactly is exactly the passionately the latest point

432
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,900
and you can show that if you do if you got classic use method you

433
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,220
get super linear convergence in general

434
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,320
so the any convergence means that you knew where the ratio of your new to

435
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,710
the previous there is going to zero as k goes to infinity

436
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,630
so very very fast OK

437
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,110
the all kinds of modifications and use method if you look at any optimisation textbook

438
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:04,640
that has nonlinear optimization and it should discussed this method and it should discuss the

439
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,810
bunch these modifications for example you can add on approx to sort of stopped the

440
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,400
steps getting too long

441
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,540
you can have a trust region constraint

442
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,820
you can calculate the minimizer this and do a line search something so many many

443
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,570
things you can do

444
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,820
one big thing is how do you choose the age

445
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:26,110
so i've already mentioned the classic choice namely the haitian there are many other things

446
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,970
you can do many of which are already mentioned in this talk

447
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,370
you can for example reuse the haitian from a previous iterate so you don't have

448
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,640
to re-evaluate every time

449
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,100
quick and dirty and often works very well you can use the sample approximation not

450
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,800
just mention that that works in the case where f is like some of the

451
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:48,860
budget component functions like that block log likelihood function that we discussed you can use

452
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,920
a diagonal approximation to the two

453
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:56,740
to the action so you can define hk to be diagonal approximation of these against

454
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,560
the scaling right across a little bit more about that in a minute

455
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:05,590
the a class methods called quasi newton methods are also a favourite topic in

456
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:10,030
and you know standard optimisation community for the last forty years or so what they

457
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,110
these do is define hk

458
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,080
two explicitly member mimic the behavior of the true version

459
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:21,330
there's only a quasi newton method you you update HK after every step so that

460
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,000
would mimic the behaviour of the true version on the last step that you just

461
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,120
you keep doing this simple updates rank one rank two and so on and if

462
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,330
you use that to define hk

463
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,310
amazingly you can get super linear convergence and that was proved about forty years ago

464
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,060
some classic results

465
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,190
nonlinear optimisation along those lines you all you ever need is great you never need

466
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,600
to do quasi met the never need secondary information

467
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:52,290
and then finally you can do special things if the if the function f for

468
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,980
some special structure you can sort of approximate

469
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,750
the haitian in some problems specific ways and the classic example of that is non

470
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:04,290
linear least squares with the objective function is the sum of squares of some vector

471
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,100
functions some residual functions

472
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,350
when f has this

473
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:13,370
structure then the passion of f has this property here is just the jacobian of

474
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:16,230
this residual function transposed with itself

475
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,080
plus the second order term

476
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,790
so this the classic method in non-linear least squares which just approximates the haitian by

477
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,600
just the first here

478
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,170
just tosses away the second term

479
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,290
and that often works fine when

480
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:33,420
jacobian is pretty well conditioned and when the residuals are small often this is a

481
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,960
pretty good approximation to the true version so that's another way that you can get

482
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,080
sort of the cheap

483
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:43,830
higher order methods with that every actually evaluating secondary evidence

484
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,460
what happens if you've got constraints irregulars we keep asking this question if you got

485
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:53,100
an unconstrained problem had a generalized to the case we've got the constraints that we

486
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,750
want to regularize

487
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,880
well if if you've got the constraints you can just take exactly the model that

488
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,870
used to get newton like step and impose this restriction

489
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,230
if you can solve this problem economically which is big enough

490
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:12,640
then the theory pretty much goes through you still get two point conversion but to

491
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,500
be if you've got if this hk is not diagonal

492
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,560
if it's some sort of dense or general

493
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:23,500
matrix it's often pretty hard to solve this problem OK so you need some sort

494
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,420
of in loop to solve this problem so it's not so clear it's economical so

495
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,400
you have to do something else quite often

496
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,600
same is more or less true in the case of the regularized

497
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:39,020
the problem we've got this time appearing the objective giving explicitly at this time under

498
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,420
the new title

499
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,810
some problem the quadratic subproblems if you can minimize this whole thing

500
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,040
most theories in the new type methodologies go through just carry through

501
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,850
but again that's a big if

502
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,540
if this is no longer diagonal this can be a lot harder to solve than

503
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:02,520
the shrink operators that i mentioned earlier

504
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,770
OK but in practice you can sort of combined with the technical just introduced if

505
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,290
if you are able to identify the manifold

506
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,400
corresponding to signal corresponding to a maker corresponding sides

507
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,270
on which the solution lies then you don't need to do any of this you

508
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:22,080
can just go to to the manifold and start doing in a sense unconstrained newton

509
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,640
steps on a reduced space and you save yourself the trouble solving these kinds of

510
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,790
i think i'll skip this one

511
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:39,370
and he's come up in machine learning have actually been some papers on and quasi

512
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:43,290
newton methods in for solving machine learning to problems

513
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,290
this is just in the last few years

514
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:52,650
that appeared in the proceedings of a aistats and and JMLR and other venues

515
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:00,080
OK so this first one sort of does a quasi newton approach on this classic

516
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:07,690
SVM loss function and again it sort of gets that second order term by doing

517
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:12,500
some sort of finite difference over the of the estimated gradients now the difference between

518
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,250
this and classical quasi newton bunch difference is one of them is it's not doesn't

519
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:22,480
have access to exact derivative information center good estimates based on sampling of these lost

520
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,350
times and so

521
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,440
you don't even have exact first of information but still using it to at least

522
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,350
i some approximation the diagonal of the passion

523
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,810
so you might not least expected to get the scaling right OK even if it's

524
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:43,150
not even if it's only a very crude approximation to the true mission

525
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,600
and the second one is somewhat related to that was in a state of years

526
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,270
now the authors about these papers call these things quasi newton methods are not really

527
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:01,290
i would say the optimisation communities causing methods i would think of is incremental

528
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,540
was stochastic gradient methods with

529
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,540
you know a sensible interesting kind of scale rather than

530
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:12,350
real quasi newton methods but we can certainly argue about the definitions

531
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:16,900
i think the term quasi newton is sort means many things to many people

532
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,500
and i sort of describe what i think what i mean by

533
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,900
there are some papers in go to for further information on the things that are

534
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,730
just discussed again these slides are on the web so i'll let you download these

535
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,210
and and

536
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,210
and look at these if you're interested

537
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,900
so here's my last topic i guess i have a few minutes left and i

538
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,400
just got a few slides and this one take very long and i wanted to

539
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,980
mention this because a lot of you already do stuff like this now wanted to

540
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,140
talk about a couple of recent contributions in this area

541
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:51,040
this is the composition where we try to minimize f over many variables x as

542
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,790
many components a classic approach is that in each iteration you fix most of those

543
00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:00,330
this is a

544
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:13,200
if should want

545
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:31,270
this means is useful

546
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,470
she she

547
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:54,230
what we need to do this

548
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,850
the one

549
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:34,600
all the

550
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:41,640
you use

551
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:56,430
and this was used to use this is

552
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:07,290
it's all is just

553
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,140
it is by

554
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,700
this is the

555
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:36,600
one here

556
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:12,020
she is

557
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,200
one of the

558
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:36,810
my have to

559
00:42:53,710 --> 00:43:00,560
and the decision

560
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:09,100
and what is

561
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:19,930
if she can she was

562
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,750
he knows

563
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:33,410
they all should

564
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:42,230
you should

565
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:54,450
now there is also a member of all

566
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:26,540
you have to use do

567
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,450
do you

568
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:37,810
wanted to

569
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:27,520
and all the

570
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:41,430
i have no reason

571
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:52,500
you you you want

572
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:18,980
and so

573
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:49,640
users in this

574
00:48:49,640 --> 00:49:00,790
i have

575
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:43,080
and now

576
00:49:43,730 --> 00:50:04,680
she that he

577
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:28,290
he was

578
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:16,210
the have gone on for what they just saw

579
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:20,810
or you could tell me that they have address

580
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:27,470
o point guard the colour just to the left

581
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:34,610
what that has to be in the case the world get the flow is our

582
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,500
interface to

583
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:39,170
what we want to send messages to the

584
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:42,540
one of the ways in which was itself

585
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,590
if you borrow information from the

586
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:47,610
three structured then you get better model seek of ten

587
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:51,360
then the method that does not border information from the second

588
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:56,520
i'm skipping a lot of details but probably hopefully get the high level idea

589
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:03,300
OK so now some other methods which one could use but have not been done

590
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,290
so one could also use something

591
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,940
one could also use ideas in

592
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,710
collaborative filtering for instance right

593
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:15,270
so so this is what collaborative filtering does so let's assume

594
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:20,710
so you is use i is item and the rating given by the user you

595
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:22,770
to itemize the weighted average

596
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,070
given by the user to related items

597
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:31,270
so there is a new item and if you want to estimate the r rating

598
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:34,340
of user for that particular item you look at

599
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:37,940
i don't have kind of very similar to to that and look at what sort

600
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:41,380
of ratings this user is given to those items like if you in there is

601
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,810
a new entertainment movie and you want to estimate how the user has been to

602
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:48,500
rate that entertainment movie you look at movies that are very similar to that particular

603
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,590
we hopefully they use it as a weighted sum of those things and you take

604
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:55,500
a weighted average of those as your prediction for the new movie for this is

605
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:00,790
what is done in what is called a this methods in collaborative

606
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:04,400
the same idea could be used here right so the rating in all cases

607
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,560
whether the user has to click on that item or not

608
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:13,060
so the challenge here is how to come up with similar acts

609
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:18,880
so in collaborative filtering the similarities are discovered automatically from data so you look at

610
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,570
for a given item you look at all the use of the data that don't

611
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:25,270
look at all the users and then you look at the ratings so far only

612
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:28,170
two items you look at all the common uses the created what i did you

613
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:32,190
look at some cosine similarity and that is how you get the similarity measure here

614
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:35,150
in this case that might not work

615
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:40,150
because first of all you don't have rating kind of data you have like one

616
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:43,960
still kind of data and the methods which work for creating kind of data does

617
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,750
not work for the zero and one kind of data so you have to do

618
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:51,340
some modifications again even in the collaborative reading literature there is no

619
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:56,590
i work in the neighborhood based methods to address the binary problem

620
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:01,940
secondly how to use semantic information which you have about the acts to come of

621
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:07,040
suitable similarity measure so these are some of the challenges of each one needs to

622
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:14,770
address before these kind of techniques become routine in this application of computational advertising

623
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,360
so this is one way of doing it i mean again this is just

624
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,190
have not done it

625
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:23,040
i don't think anyone else has done it but this is just one idea maybe

626
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:25,940
may or may not work i don't know what the something one could do so

627
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,990
one could write a model where you see the log odds of CTR for a

628
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:34,940
given that on equity is some functions of this function is again as as it

629
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,860
comes from the logistic regression this is what we get from the logistic regression so

630
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:44,130
he supplemented by another to see some related terms e and then u

631
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:49,710
you put your body constraint on this latency which is looks something like what you

632
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:51,840
do in collaborative

633
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,340
well the good thing is that since this variable is late and you can measure

634
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,150
it is like a rating variables like continuous variable and you can actually write down

635
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:04,290
the rating function exactly the same way as you do in collaborative

636
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,960
now that the added complexity here is

637
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,820
this is a latent variable and you know you're trying to translate this latent variable

638
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:17,770
into the probability score so you have to write down a generative model using

639
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:23,710
the logistic regression formula that is going to involve this functions e which has this

640
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:27,460
constraint so you need to come up with some yem algorithm called the good estimates

641
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,170
of these guys so that's the challenge but this is a framework which should work

642
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,860
in principle there is no reason why it should work

643
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:43,880
yeah i can cannot so all that stuff which is done in collaborative filtering can

644
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:47,230
all go through here but it is in the latent space

645
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,790
so all the collaborative filtering models work but in the latent space so how to

646
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,540
translate the information from the latent space to the data is the challenge which have

647
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,770
not been addressed but it could be done

648
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,920
even for computational advertising

649
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,340
so again we have not done it i don't know whether it's going to work

650
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:05,980
on that looks like a reasonable approach to trust

651
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,480
the but other thing that this is actually being done

652
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:12,650
factorisation approach right so you say well

653
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:15,380
there is a logistic regression and then

654
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,250
there is some residual interaction between them

655
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:22,360
query and that's going to be captured by projecting the query then adding to some

656
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:26,590
lower dimensional space and then became across so this has been done on the people

657
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:30,610
have kind of dress that in some recent paper some of them will appear to

658
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,110
so so this is this this works you

659
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:42,190
you can actually estimate these latent factors by running in yemen gibbs sampling algorithm works

660
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:45,980
in the previous one has not been done i think this is pretty exciting if

661
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,070
it can be done

662
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:50,360
in fact what would be exciting is to combine this with that cover the more

663
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:55,170
realistic approach to the factorisation components neighborhood component combine them both

664
00:57:55,190 --> 00:58:00,690
use semantic information which you have about the ads on pages about that and quit

665
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,150
to derive neighborhood structure the

666
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:06,090
so it would be very nice piece of

667
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:13,270
all o

668
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:19,790
yeah that the feature based at the local and the global global

669
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,640
the word error rate which one called down

670
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:24,250
things have been progressing well in the nineties

671
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,740
even though the algorithms themselves haven't changed that much

672
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,680
india in those years

673
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:34,490
i was actually working on speech recognition myself in the early nineties

674
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,240
when i completed my peach tea in ninety one

675
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,770
so there was mostly advances because if the

676
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:43,900
being able to train

677
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,710
bigger systems bigger models

678
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,600
faster with faster computers much larger datasets but there's only so much you can do without

679
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:57,060
and in the decade that followed things have kind of

680
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,170
and then progress started to accelerate again

681
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:03,890
with the use deep learning

682
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:08,320
that's the kinda reason why people have being attracted to this area

683
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,050
something similar has happened in object recognition

684
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:14,800
at about the same time a little bit later

685
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:17,670
there was a breakthrough in one of these e

686
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:19,400
was interesting

687
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:27,250
challenging tasks in object-recognition be imagenet dataset that has a thousand classes about objects and about a million

688
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:30,400
training examples are actually now twenty million

689
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:37,230
end you see here outputs of this early system which was getting around seventeen percent

690
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,360
correct in the sense if the

691
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:40,680
having the right answer

692
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:41,890
the first five

693
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:48,780
more modern systems that the latest systems have now are now down to

694
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,000
five or six percent these worthy

695
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:54,360
numbers as they were in two thousand twelve

696
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:57,820
so on the right hand side you see e

697
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:03,860
error rates obtained by by others systems competing in those days with the system could

698
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,520
buy extras asking yes discovering geoff hinton

699
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:07,880
one this competition

700
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,940
but it down forever from about twenty six percent heritable sixteen percent air

701
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:14,040
i said in in the

702
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:20,170
ure afterwards they brought it down to around eleven this year's down to six percent something

703
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,920
so our there's been amazing progress

704
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:25,540
thanks these techniques

705
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:28,290
you can try it out for yourself

706
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:31,940
russell could probably show this euro

707
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:34,500
this morning

708
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,510
just deep learning that's yes that toronto that you

709
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:42,910
u go therein you can upload your relevant and image

710
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:45,970
it will

711
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,450
uses these one thousand categories to try to identify the main objective in the image so here

712
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,860
it's in convertible

713
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,890
seeing chimpanzees

714
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:02,500
you're saying sports car and i just think those images

715
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,360
you know searching large using google image search and pasted them

716
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,640
it is it's not always perfect

717
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,100
for example here it says killer whale

718
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:21,260
with thirty five per cent confidence and tiger shark with ninety percent confidence in school would either

719
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,030
so it's not always perfect of course and there's a lot more to be done

720
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:30,390
this german shepherd was perfectly recognized

721
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,680
if you've tried computer vision and object recognition

722
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,340
in the past it was very brittle

723
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:42,800
these systems are just

724
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:48,070
called the change by the way in which they are robust to all kinds of

725
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,820
variations in illumination and background and things like that

726
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:55,140
in my lab with applying these techniques to

727
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:01,200
classification from movie clips from video using both the audio and images

728
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,020
and we want competition

729
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:05,900
i was held last december

730
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:08,210
using using

731
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:10,080
are fairly similar systems

732
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,740
so with these another advances in two thousand thirteen

733
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:20,490
you might it larger review declared planning to be one of the ten breakthrough technologies for the year

734
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:22,870
and then there's been a lot of

735
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,220
journalist talking about in new york times and wired and others

736
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,970
companies have started competing

737
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:35,740
four hour

738
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:43,340
before the technology and for the people working on it on a particular google facebook wear

739
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,080
in an arms race to

740
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,260
acquirer are

741
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,610
companies are people

742
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:55,760
one big event and this was the google buying deadline for about five hundred million dollars

743
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:01,110
anne now there's tons of start ups in this in this area

744
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:05,650
and there is also a very natural example submodularity so imagine this is the

745
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:10,690
case I have these sets A A one through A N and my function F is

746
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:15,570
the size of the union of these sets okay and

747
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:22,400
what I have here right I have this set of sets S and I have this

748
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:28,030
T and now I'm asking how much benefit do I get if I'm adding X right and this is

749
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:33,790
clearly submodular right because I'm interested in the union of green and blue and

750
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:38,010
once and the other time I'm interested in the union of blue of blue red

751
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:42,890
and green and now I'm asking how much benefit does does adding X give

752
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:46,250
me to my to my union right and if if I have my

753
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:52,990
S these three guys then basically the whole X is added so I get huge benefit here right

754
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,550
while if I already start with blue and red only this I get only this part of X so my

755
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:05,230
benefit of adding X is smaller and this is submodularity right and now in our case you

756
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:08,730
can sort of think that every node this would be like the influence circle of every

757
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:14,810
node so you say oh if this node would be active this many nodes would get influence so now you can

758
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:21,450
you can already start to see why we have this submodularity property okay

759
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:25,470
so there are a few more things we need to do before we see it why

760
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:29,450
why why we have the property so the way I explain the model right now it's not

761
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:34,790
clear exactly when the nodes when the coins get flipped but what we can do

762
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:38,930
is we can generate this randomness ahead of time so we can go without even knowing

763
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:42,170
what is the initial active set we can just go and flip and flip all the

764
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:46,070
coins and let's say these are the these are the coins that came up heads so

765
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:51,170
this would be the edges over which the the influence will propagate right so for

766
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:56,610
every edge we we we decide in advance whether if there if there is  if if it

767
01:04:56,610 --> 01:05:02,090
comes to the state where there would be an influence propagating over it we know whether it will

768
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:08,310
transmit or not and we call these edges being live okay and now what is what is

769
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:12,430
F of S what is the size of the active set it's just a size a set

770
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:17,010
that this is reachable by live edge paths right what I mean by that is

771
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:20,470
so for example this is the this is

772
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:24,330
the thing right this is the the active set right so if

773
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:28,210
these two guys are active then then this person could like influence these people

774
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:33,420
and not this one because there's no active path to the node F and now

775
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:37,650
actually now we see that the whole thing is submodular right we know that the the

776
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:42,890
the the linear combination of submodular functions is submodular and we know and these that like the

777
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:47,890
sets right it's a union of sets so what this tells us is that we are able

778
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:52,550
to efficiently find the most influential nodes in the network and maybe I didn't tell this

779
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:57,190
but why would you want to do that is I know if you if you

780
01:05:57,190 --> 01:06:01,410
are a viral marketing company and you and you ask which people should I give a

781
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:06,010
free iPod so that they go and buy and they go and influence their friends right

782
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:12,970
so and this way we we found an an approximation algorithm for finding these influential people

783
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:20,310
now I can go into the empirical part and show and show a and ask these questions

784
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:24,060
how do diffusion curves look like so the thing I was talking before the diminishing

785
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:33,450
returns for critical mass and how do cascades look like always the structure

786
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:48,310
of the graph of the network is fixed by the ja it can work for a simulated display but when you go to real biases not like

787
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:58,810
that because let's say that withouth this is the time for all

788
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:06,910
you know he's a sum of time to be a through the

789
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:16,490
this is all I admit I agree on the item by the best I can

790
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:20,690
answer is just some model alright I mean you always have this trade of between having something really

791
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:25,050
complex but then you can't analyze it or having having something simple and this seems to be

792
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:29,770
simple enough but I agree that topology of the network changes and so on

793
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:51,660
mistake of the node sure I agree but but let's get back to this empirical part right

794
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,980
so okay these are the questions we'll ask so what what's the challenge or what

795
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:59,330
do we want to go to do so basically we need a large data set where the

796
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:03,250
where we can go and observe diffusion so we want a dataset where we can go and

797
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:09,630
actually measure how the influence propagates or we need a social network and we need these social

798
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:15,730
network links and behavior that spread pretty much similar and there there are three three data sets

799
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:20,190
or three cases three studies that I will show one is on blogs where we observe how

800
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:26,870
information propagates right somebody writes something and then other people cite it and this spreads over network so

801
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,690
second one are these product recommendations where we are asking how the product recommendations and purchases

802
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:36,510
propagate through the social network and the other one is community membership so basically you could

803
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:43,310
think that community membership is also some kind some kind of viral thing and I'll come to details

804
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:48,630
of these okay so first in blogs what do I mean by diffusion in blogs so this is the

805
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:54,110
like a schematic picture of the blogosphere right we have blogs so slash dot would

806
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:58,260
be this would be like a slash dot webpage and every blog

807
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:02,930
blog has like this time stamped posts right so the circles are the posts so

808
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:06,670
here we have six blogs and I know this is a big blog with like

809
01:09:06,990 --> 01:09:12,090
six posts and this is a smaller blog what we also have is a a time stamped

810
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:16,410
hyperlinks right so what we can do now is we can go and see how

811
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:22,750
information propagates right so if these guys set something and then some other blog referred to it then we know

812
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:29,210
that he must have had read read the story and using a hyperlink they

813
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:34,350
they referred to it and now we can go and observe how the how the story spread right

814
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:39,270
the assumption here is that whenever somebody said something and other people referred to it

815
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:44,470
now we can say that this person in this is the flow of information right the the direction

816
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:48,830
of the arrows shows the direction of the hyperlink so the influence spread this way

817
01:09:48,830 --> 01:10:03,250
ok yeah

818
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:11,700
normally would be that all three that would be the I

819
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:16,130
mean depends on what is the discussion right so if if if I

820
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:20,610
just want to if if these guy is someone who discovered an interesting story then this guy

821
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:24,870
could definitely point to here but maybe this is a political discussion so it

822
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:31,570
the the the

823
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:46,590
this presentation is delivered by the stanford center for professional development

824
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:52,610
OK well welcome to see is one six people from interaction maybe make is on

825
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,430
that's interesting OK

826
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:58,570
the website actually was part of the most important thing to take away from here

827
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:01,600
it is working you find information about the class talk today gives them overview and

828
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,460
and stuff like that this is kind of the home base for all the material

829
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,890
so if you manage to get their hands on the way and you're golden otherwise

830
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:10,920
you can get from the website there's a lot of background information staff information office

831
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:15,310
hours also to stop their gathered his car one-stop shopping for figuring out things about

832
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:21,470
our course they wanted a first day a lot of your shop and try to

833
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:24,110
check out figure out what's the right thing for use so hopefully it and try

834
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:27,390
to give you some information to help you make the decision once a lot of

835
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:31,970
course is about to administration and logistics most that's pretty ordinary you can read about

836
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:36,250
it that was that marketing i get to give you my advice opinions of what

837
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:40,380
is the absolute best case you could possibly take i get paid for student you

838
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:45,410
that's not true and maybe we have time to to

839
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:48,430
check out all the possible language redundant today

840
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,410
and need to go it

841
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:54,160
i that is what is it

842
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:58,080
this is one of six in the introductory programming sequence here at stanford right with

843
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:02,080
our version of CS one where you start at the beginning when you are interested

844
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,940
in learning more about programming we have the two core sequence a and b that

845
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,300
kind of fall together they are not particularly tightly coupled which is to say if

846
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:12,910
you took a radical break you can come back to be or maybe you actually

847
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:17,770
took a variant of one six eight a course the summer and another institution are

848
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:20,240
probably fine place for starting the stream

849
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:23,940
we also have an alternate form of the this is one of six x kind

850
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:27,100
of honor version of the second course so after you've taken the first course and

851
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:31,660
you're feeling really jazz that there is an alternative more intense way to get to

852
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:35,340
the second course offered was offered the score in fact if you actually think about

853
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:39,930
that that is an option for you as well as stick with us what do

854
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:44,910
we do when i was six official title is programming methodology it's starting at the

855
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:49,780
very beginning and assuming you have no background in programming is teaching you how it

856
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:53,190
works right what languages look like what the syntax is like what things you need

857
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:56,750
to know about how to solve problems using a computer so it covers a lot

858
01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:01,410
of the the fundamentals biological control flow in general i think of the the big

859
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:05,730
issues for one six a having mostly with a particular syntax or or feature that

860
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:09,070
you learn about the language but about how do you solve problems on computer has

861
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:12,250
somebody gives you specification of you need about a program that does acts and you

862
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:15,320
have to figure out how to make that happen how to break it down had

863
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:19,910
step through it how to develop it how to test it had iterate on it

864
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:23,980
how to make changes and later how to debug it one is not working well

865
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:27,780
and those things i think transcends any particular language we have to use the java

866
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:32,010
programming language and one six a course because it's a great tool for

867
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:36,130
introductory programming but i don't think about it being really critical so in fact if

868
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:40,230
you're introductory course was in some other language some of the fairly modern high-level language

869
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:45,530
you know so you you learned in pipeline you've say learned and schema something other

870
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:48,560
than java your but we still find is what we're really counting on to be

871
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,790
is that you know how to program you have to think like a computer scientist

872
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:56,060
and solve problems but not a lot of the details of syntax are going to

873
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,810
be important to us

874
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:02,720
the picks up from there saying OK you got some fundamentals let's start learning some

875
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:06,000
of the techniques that extend the range of problems you can solve

876
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:11,060
we look at recursion which is one of the fundamental problem solving techniques right involves

877
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:15,760
using something akin to mathematical induction to solve problems in terms of cells looking a

878
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,670
lot of algorithms for sorting and searching and hashing and doing things efficiently right knowing

879
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:25,130
how to compare and contrast alternatives and algorithms having some formalism which discuss the things

880
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:29,490
on some of the classics that are out there for solving these problems the dynamic

881
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:34,650
data structures which involves use of pointers to construct things like list reason he graph

882
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:40,060
that model certain structures that are very effective in solving different kinds of problems will

883
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,450
work through those and that a large part of our time is spent on this

884
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:46,490
concept of data abstraction which is why abstraction shows up kind of is the main

885
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:51,390
water title is how do we know if we start from more and more complex

886
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:55,800
problems write the code itself can can become overwhelming we don't have some techniques for

887
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,790
managing complexity and one of the big teams for one six b is how we

888
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:03,290
can use this idea of abstraction building something in dealing with a little bit of

889
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,950
closing up the box and now treating it as a kind of fixed entity and

890
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:11,280
building on top of that practice called another way around that as a way of

891
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:15,110
kind of working on something and finishing moving on from larger piece without having the

892
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:19,900
said by the character is excellent and

893
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:20,590
that's it

894
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:23,750
this is already more from the for

895
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:32,320
absolutely i will come back to this is very simplified model from

896
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:38,580
that's very interesting by combined total

897
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:42,440
is just introduce introduced to right so before we

898
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:48,260
we go about che forest it's not about the classification gives you all of this

899
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:54,510
is just my point so in classification random subjects observations y y y

900
01:15:54,570 --> 01:16:00,190
which take place our time you want and what want to do is to construct

901
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:06,420
classifier just mentioned which is also one of the world in which one is best

902
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:12,290
for for specific just that's what i call prince you know

903
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:19,800
it is and so the decision not to accept some of the success was the

904
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,040
first one

905
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:25,680
what you want to do is is to minimize damage there is no advantages by

906
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:27,430
so called base classifiers

907
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,590
which is just one way

908
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:33,990
besides one where the regression function approach

909
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:38,630
it's not what you said you

910
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:40,430
it turns out

911
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:46,470
coming back i from just called bayes is a web two o

912
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:47,810
or you can

913
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:50,050
and of course

914
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:56,890
after this talk page try to design classifier which is called bayes risk

915
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:59,780
that's what she said

916
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:02,670
was he or she has said that he

917
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:06,090
what we try to do is to update such consistency

918
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,470
and distribution of the observation

919
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:14,640
now what about

920
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:20,420
randomized classifer we just think about randomized classifier this college and the use of random

921
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:22,650
to calculate

922
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,470
because the decision

923
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,220
that's just for example

924
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:32,760
trains run through the process the way to get on the call for

925
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,160
one is that of course

926
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:40,190
the probability of all of the search engine

927
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:44,900
it's just that we propose making that integrate the whole

928
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:49,900
of the she of was missing

929
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:54,890
now once you introduced from the our

930
01:17:54,900 --> 01:18:00,640
you can of course find any recession and the realisation of human history and you

931
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:02,580
you ten

932
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,290
what we call forty five

933
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:11,010
which is just averaging over all realizations just turned around and

934
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,810
this means that the average over all tree

935
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:15,510
of the first

936
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:20,470
very ones war

937
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,280
of course

938
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:23,050
this is just average

939
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:27,390
just said one who your one of the results

940
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,810
the that same year

941
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,730
when you are just

942
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:36,030
and of course once this what want to do is to make first team

943
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,870
which is you think some kind of classifier

944
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:45,370
call the average classifier which is just the same way take expectation over the

945
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:46,560
instead of so

946
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:52,970
but in practice we saw last week and that she this kind of research institution

947
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,010
which is by

948
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,840
the average

949
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:58,470
now we have three

950
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:01,330
classifiers are one

951
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:04,030
randomized one average one so

952
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,970
what can we say about

953
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,100
there is the first

954
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:09,860
and as a result we said that

955
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:14,800
if the sequence of randomized classifier is consistent with the distribution of this one

956
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:17,220
that is that somehow we can just proved

957
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:21,310
that will end with the number of observations

958
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:24,950
if you classify even randomized classifiers can cause

959
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:26,430
the voting classifier

960
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,020
the average fifty five remain constant

961
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:31,810
this is what proposition which is a really interesting

962
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,480
it's pretty clear the original rather

963
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,400
this is the way

964
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:39,350
going to

965
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:42,590
can request services to

966
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:46,340
we can really prove interesting

967
01:19:47,610 --> 01:19:49,710
and typically we can prove for example

968
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:55,950
we can prove the consistency of that very simple random for action to you

969
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:00,310
here we do this sort of course random forests

970
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:04,660
is a collection of randomized for what you want the first step

971
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:08,810
and this way

972
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:12,260
it's from the parameters capture with tree on

973
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:15,530
this variable is set to

974
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:17,050
the way

975
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:19,200
we performed a tribute

976
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:23,580
we can find same way was supported by an average fifty five

977
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:24,990
typically horsehair

978
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,720
the strings are

979
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:33,040
sixteen seventeenth eighteenth century

980
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:37,100
it's not for those people

981
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:40,160
so i'm sorry i we i got lots of things going on here this might

982
01:20:40,290 --> 01:20:47,320
show just play a scaled quickly and then brought pizzicato tremolo

983
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:48,770
in the field

984
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:51,810
deeper dive

985
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:54,350
there is no uh

986
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,160
and in the

987
01:20:57,170 --> 01:21:00,530
something that

988
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:03,730
i do admit coffee this morning

989
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:09,260
so tell us about what you're doing here so there are lots different techniques to

990
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:11,740
create different colors and

991
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,610
and think the

992
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:18,460
any one of is taken

993
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:24,820
he was well into the his string

994
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:27,800
the difference of play

995
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:34,640
so what

996
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,930
so that's that

997
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:04,150
there which is in

998
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:08,000
OK then just quickly play kind of four

999
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:17,000
OK finally tremolo

1000
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,700
statement little village to the music

1001
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:34,380
alright great thank you very much

1002
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:37,480
so i don't know if i can whether technically this will work or not i've

1003
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:40,780
tried all morning to get this to work i have it up on my screen

1004
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:44,970
but i don't see it up on the screen there can have attack assistant to

1005
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:49,770
all right we'll go back here to try this

1006
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:55,710
it began nothing happened

1007
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,070
last summer standard

1008
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:01,660
it doesn't do me much good to have somebody in the back going like this

1009
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:07,480
OK what i would like one i wanted to show you was a clip that

1010
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:12,170
actually what my daughter brought to my attention just this past weekend she was watching

1011
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:15,150
television america has talent

1012
01:23:15,210 --> 01:23:17,490
anybody watch this american talent

1013
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:21,050
and she said you gotta watch this is the most amazing thing i've got these

1014
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:24,320
two guys on here call not bit strings

1015
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:28,130
so i did and i went issue it seems the links to

1016
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:36,380
youtube here let's see if we can get this girl i no

1017
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:55,980
to do something with the person that

1018
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:29,240
so obviously the violin is not just the study thing from the red to have

1019
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:34,400
some legs today are used in folk music used in sometimes you see them in

1020
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:39,180
nashville playing with country music that kind of thing is this travesty to use violent

1021
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:43,470
with with hip-hop here again this is part of course this is wonderful this is

1022
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:47,660
the best thing that's happened the violence in the last hundred years there will be

1023
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:51,710
millions of kids out there and she had like to play the violin two

1024
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:57,610
so this is wonderful the sort of cross examination of genres here bringing this particular

1025
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:03,910
in instrument traditional classical violin into the popular are so let's put that aside we

1026
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:07,740
talked little bit about sound production here i've got two pieces i'm going to work

1027
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:13,740
with here for the end of our session we have fifteen minutes left and here

1028
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:17,930
are these two pieces the first you can see on the border there is by

1029
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:23,680
another russian composer but that resort ski it's called polish oxcart

1030
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:29,720
from his work pictures at an exhibition what happened was a friend friend died from

1031
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:34,770
was an artist friend left these pictures as an omaha to the painter

1032
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:39,460
source he sat down and tried to come up with create a musical response to

1033
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:43,690
now getting back to the whole strategy of poliovirus infection

1034
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:48,580
this raises the issue of what it was in the polio virus that was able

1035
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,930
to evoke

1036
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:52,560
the subsequent lifelong immunity

1037
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:58,330
and in telling you that i mentioned the following you can make it easier from

1038
01:25:58,380 --> 01:25:59,600
you can make sierra

1039
01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:04,380
a individual who's been immunized with poliovirus

1040
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:06,500
and regular recollect we

1041
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:10,150
i mentioned this before the way to make serum is to allow blood to clot

1042
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:14,150
the red cells and platelets aggregate in the bottom and what remains on top is

1043
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:18,300
simply serum you can spin out all the residual cells and so on you get

1044
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,350
sort of the straw colored fluid

1045
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:28,010
and that serum from individuals been immunized with poliovirus staff can actually be used to

1046
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,060
you can add to the polio virus

1047
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:33,080
stock prior to

1048
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:36,670
adding these virus particles to the petri dish

1049
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:39,080
so here's the petri dish as before

1050
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:43,210
and what you find is that if you had serum from people from an individual

1051
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:47,580
is when realized to the polio to a solution of polio virus particles

1052
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:50,080
and then you take that mixed and put them on the plate

1053
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:54,120
you know longer get any of these plaques that i referred to before

1054
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:58,890
and that indicates that was in the serum there's some kind of factor which is

1055
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:03,600
neutralizing the infected body of the polio virus particles

1056
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:07,850
i e the polio virus particles are in some way

1057
01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:15,680
prevented from creating an infection and their platform ability their ability to conform to corrode

1058
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,940
these holes

1059
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:21,170
in the layers of subsequently infected cultures is now compromised

1060
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:29,610
and such a activity suggesting that that such an individual has actually increased serum i

1061
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:32,840
e some kind of reactivity which prevents

1062
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:35,990
the polio virus particle from doing it's thing

1063
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:41,310
in fact i can tell you that such and this year or section neutralizing into

1064
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:44,550
here can be achieved in a number of ways

1065
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:48,650
one way to do it is just to take the protein capsid the outer coat

1066
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:53,550
of the polio virus particle that describe before and inject that into an individual and

1067
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:59,590
that will on its own already evoke a measure of anti-viral immunity will also it

1068
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:05,270
will evoke a concentration camps here in the blood of a patient

1069
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:08,380
or if you want to do it very much more modern way

1070
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,860
you can sequence

1071
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:13,940
the proteins of the polio virus and determine the amino acid sequence

1072
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:20,140
and when you do that you can synthesize through organic synthesis although peptides of ten

1073
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:23,030
or twenty amino acids long

1074
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:27,640
and these are the only goal peptides reflect different parts of the polio virus coat

1075
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:32,090
protein so here's the sequence of one of the capsid proteins

1076
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:37,430
recall the capsid refers to the cold it's the shielding or protecting in this case

1077
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:42,080
of polio poliovirus the single stranded viral RNA genome so here's one of the capsid

1078
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:46,330
proteins what you can do is to figure out the amino acid sequence of this

1079
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:50,590
segment of the capsid proteins and and then rather than cutting it out from the

1080
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:56,870
capital you just synthesized by organic synthesis ten or twenty amino acid residues long

1081
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:02,310
and when you inject that all legal peptide into an individual that may also evoke

1082
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:05,880
some kind of neutralizing antibody response

1083
01:29:05,890 --> 01:29:10,960
in fact as you might guess correctly imagine if we can look in more detail

1084
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:15,380
of the capsid structure i'm just going to draw to very primitive way here

1085
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:20,360
it's it's obviously much much more complicated but this is the caps here it has

1086
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,860
an inside and outside

1087
01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:24,090
and the

1088
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:30,770
antibodies that you make against a and although peptide that sticking out on the outside

1089
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:32,530
will be neutralising

1090
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:37,530
i e did this year will be able to recognise the outside of the virus

1091
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:44,830
particle and somehow inactivated but if you were to make a use although peptide antigens

1092
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:45,980
from over here

1093
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:50,600
which might be a part of the capsid protein that is deep inside

1094
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:54,930
well even though you might have a good reactivity was only go peptide wouldn't be

1095
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:58,300
and that suggests

1096
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:01,570
the notion that whatever is present in the answers here

1097
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:04,680
is recognizing some internal external

1098
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:11,240
portion of this protein which is sticking out and the external portion is called antigen

1099
01:30:11,330 --> 01:30:17,150
so this is specific chemical structure which has been recognised by the answers serum

1100
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,070
and we call that antigen

1101
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:20,990
in principle there are

1102
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,580
dozens of distinct pathogens on the surface of the polio virus particle

1103
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:31,050
each of which one can in principle make an immunizing antibodies against

1104
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:34,820
each of those one can therefore considered to be an integer

1105
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:41,010
and how can we imagine this and this year was actually successfully neutralising the

1106
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:42,980
the virus particles

1107
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:49,270
and here this on actually the biochemical characterization of ants here because one soon came

1108
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:50,230
to learn

1109
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,350
that within easier or

1110
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:55,610
what we call antibodies or keep in mind

1111
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:58,630
in biology never should ever use the simple

1112
01:30:58,670 --> 01:31:02,590
anglo-saxon word if you can use much more complicated creature

1113
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:07,400
latin one so we can always call these immunoglobulin you see the word right there

1114
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:13,620
immunoglobulin represents an antibody molecule and it turns out that there is that much of

1115
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:17,680
the protein in the soluble fraction of

1116
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:20,060
are zero

1117
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:25,280
these consist consists of such antibody molecules and these antibody molecules have a very interesting

1118
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:31,060
structure which would like to dwell upon momentarily but before i do that i just

1119
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:35,710
want to anticipate what i'm about to say by indicating that we now realise an

1120
01:31:35,710 --> 01:31:43,090
antibody molecule can recognise antigens on the surface of the virus particle and the body

1121
01:31:43,090 --> 01:31:45,650
molecule can actually physically blind

1122
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,910
two this antigen

1123
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:52,410
so we have an antigen antibody complex and that binding of the antibody molecule

1124
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:57,660
to the surface of the virus particle is what results functionally

1125
01:31:57,670 --> 01:32:00,620
in the neutralisation of its in fact if it

1126
01:32:00,630 --> 01:32:02,490
or to put it another way

1127
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:08,550
it given the fact that this particular capsid proteins might be repeated let's say sixty

1128
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:14,140
times around the spherical surface of the virus particle there might be in fact sixty

1129
01:32:14,150 --> 01:32:18,590
different antibody molecules recognizing this repeated antigen which occurs

1130
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:23,900
on each of these capsid proteins and therefore you can imagine very approximate way

1131
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:28,170
but if you have an effective neutralizing antibody it's coating the surface of the virus

1132
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:34,400
particle antibody molecules and that clearly obstructs the ability of the virus particle to initiate

1133
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,980
a subsequent round of infection

1134
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:42,840
here's what a single antibody molecule looks like and it has some critically important features

1135
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:44,020
first of all

1136
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:48,630
there is a specific region of the antibody that recognizes

1137
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,310
the temperature

1138
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:54,400
in this case i'm using is the example the antigen and although peptide on the

1139
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,780
surface of the the

1140
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:02,240
polio virus particle and that is located in this part of

1141
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,650
antibody molecule

1142
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:09,000
note by the way the antibody molecule is a heterodimer tetra more it has two

1143
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:14,180
light chains too small chains here on the right and two heavy chains

1144
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:20,190
so i heard this argument several times also well you know where the problem with

1145
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:23,810
your nets is that you know this is the only endemic work

1146
01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:27,500
you know jeff actually made the made the joke in this

1147
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:31,230
he doesn't the order of course but he said the joke anyway it was something

1148
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:34,790
that jordan's tutorial and several people have talked about this and this is entirely not

1149
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:38,640
not too is actually a guy called mike mike you who can also do it

1150
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:46,700
he has never heard of michael like OK let me show you my cornelius

1151
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:53,910
so my company produces really nice websites on could project car

1152
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:59,040
we're basically took the papers on you know comes from that some of my papers

1153
01:33:59,150 --> 01:34:00,660
purchasing must be

1154
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:03,780
and said you know what they are implemented this so

1155
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:07,820
he we implemented it improve build this really nice little windows application you can click

1156
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:13,610
on stuff and recognizing his digits you can download the code and he explains you

1157
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:14,770
know everything

1158
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:19,070
you do that you do this and you know high school were stand but

1159
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:22,420
this page is an pages of that stuff and you know all the details the

1160
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:25,220
experiences of different things are implemented you know

1161
01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:29,220
stochastic diagonal the remark or at least of all the tricks in the book but

1162
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:33,200
just reading the paper is a very very nice

1163
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:39,960
so these guys were petition in nineteen

1164
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:41,490
but you get

1165
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:44,960
OK we see

1166
01:34:47,210 --> 01:34:52,940
this is the guy macon is happening twenty seven california where he specializes in computer

1167
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:55,810
and structural patterns if for a hobby

1168
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:59,220
and in to keep

1169
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:01,470
i understand technology

1170
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:03,190
his current OK

1171
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:06,000
all right so it's not like you know

1172
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:14,150
and that's his real application here that works really well this is the next but

1173
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:19,490
here running it on the one which means that there would nice

1174
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:23,060
so again

1175
01:35:23,070 --> 01:35:30,350
OK so this is insult i just you know read the papers this on his

1176
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:34,930
own for fun and then last year and this was actually and it's an email

1177
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:38,910
saying you know introducing you know what you think so something called

1178
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:43,960
that's true

1179
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:49,720
he said that and so was about not only is OK

1180
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:55,310
so i mean you no disrespect going but

1181
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:58,360
but but it's not like

1182
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,470
there is no mystery in there

1183
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:05,920
OK you get this

1184
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:08,000
the centre has

1185
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:09,680
how much i left

1186
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:14,640
they finished six minutes OK good

1187
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:18,660
all right so i think what stops people from using non convex optimisation is just

1188
01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:21,460
the right tools in right central tools

1189
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:22,930
all right

1190
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:29,060
a software tools or theoretical tools certainly this surgical tools you know they can missing

1191
01:36:29,170 --> 01:36:31,380
but but the other tools aren't

1192
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:33,740
so there is one really cool tool

1193
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:37,930
there are some of us have been you know using four for about twenty years

1194
01:36:38,230 --> 01:36:45,110
were fifteen at least called automatic differentiation actually very very simple version of automatic differentiation

1195
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:49,270
so automatic differentiation is this really is there's whole community on this mostly in sort

1196
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:54,560
of numerical methods where you can write a program in fortran and c plus plus

1197
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:58,930
or whatever and automatically spits out the code to compute the derivative of water functions

1198
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:00,640
program computes

1199
01:37:01,650 --> 01:37:04,880
and i have to say the best reference on this

1200
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:09,360
recent reference is not the best reference but the the people who really understood is

1201
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:10,190
the best

1202
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:13,670
it's going to take a few years for the community to really can understand what

1203
01:37:13,670 --> 01:37:18,810
they're doing but really people understand the best are barak pearlmutter and geoff siskind siskind

1204
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:24,500
whose he actually did they published a paper they actually but this paper in programming

1205
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:32,210
languages programming language on all basically that the whole type system for for automatic differentiation

1206
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:36,560
using on calculus and functional programming and it's completely worked it out and they can

1207
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:41,090
produce really efficient code that is so she can use iterative anything

1208
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:46,580
since recall one insistence that one i implemented for the

1209
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:49,970
system that use for research and all i could also

1210
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:56,340
kind of picked up for storage system and wrongly which used for his mum monty

1211
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:57,930
python systems

1212
01:37:58,250 --> 01:38:03,330
is a very simple idea doesn't use any complicated concepts you can implemented in almost

1213
01:38:03,330 --> 01:38:04,600
any language

1214
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:09,330
but you have implemented in matlab which is why don't you know

1215
01:38:09,370 --> 01:38:13,790
and the is very simple in fact you could probably applies to make although probably

1216
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:18,310
if you have a bunch of modules that sort of computer virus functions and the

1217
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:23,040
pass information to each other in the forms of the former vectors or whatever for

1218
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,520
each of the modules you had to write basically two

1219
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,890
two functions two methods you want so this could be a class and then we

1220
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,170
member functions the two methods

1221
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,920
one could probably from does is it takes input to compute the output with the

1222
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:38,510
input by pressing the function one could be proud and what the problem is is

1223
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:42,940
that given the gradient of whatever loss function respectively outputs multiple of the jacobian and

1224
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:44,140
compute the gradient of

1225
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:48,370
whatever doesn't respect input so it's very simple thing to write you can write this

1226
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:55,350
fall into modules you have you know the combinations softmax you know see whatever

1227
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:57,060
and then by

1228
01:38:57,080 --> 01:39:01,140
assembling things like this and we have for the past from the probably property rights

1229
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:05,890
new classes you can essentially build any complex function automatically and you don't have to

1230
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:09,850
worry about actually writing code to compute the gradient is automatic

1231
01:39:09,850 --> 01:39:14,250
this can it's you know object oriented implementation of ten all right

1232
01:39:14,270 --> 01:39:15,790
it's nothing more than that

1233
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:19,240
it would be consistent

1234
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:23,640
so consistent here would mean to say two things

1235
01:39:24,630 --> 01:39:30,150
we say that so this taking this this function is consistent if

1236
01:39:30,190 --> 01:39:34,900
i have a convergence in probability of

1237
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:37,290
the expected risk of my

1238
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:38,480
optimized function

1239
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:41,450
towards the end

1240
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,830
the optimum value of the risk

1241
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:49,550
also if the empirical risk

1242
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,550
on this particular and

1243
01:39:53,810 --> 01:39:57,800
in probability towards conversion pretty towards also

1244
01:39:58,570 --> 01:40:05,770
disc these optimal value of the risk

1245
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:10,770
so what you can see here on this graph when i increase the number of

1246
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:12,490
the size of my sample

1247
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:17,030
i would like that the empirical risk

1248
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:23,120
of the this optimum function goes here and the expected risk also

1249
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:32,710
the empirical risk of this particular functions

1250
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:39,520
is over the training set it's called the training that's exactly what is it

1251
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:40,820
we know that the

1252
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:44,360
training error is by its estimate of the risk

1253
01:40:44,410 --> 01:40:45,670
so we have

1254
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:47,050
that because we

1255
01:40:47,070 --> 01:40:49,370
you cannot anymore

1256
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:54,790
super separate put it out of the text and so

1257
01:40:54,850 --> 01:40:58,410
it's something we zero and that's can be interpreted that

1258
01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:03,490
they do saying that the solution found on a particular

1259
01:41:03,530 --> 01:41:11,210
and the particular training set it's much better on this training set that in any

1260
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:15,920
of the training set that could fall from from the same distribution

1261
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:20,000
so that's what that means

1262
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:21,320
so we know that

1263
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:28,630
can we at least if we know that it's not by but could we

1264
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:29,690
about this

1265
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:31,610
the difference between

1266
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:37,530
the training error and the six this will which is called the generalisation error which

1267
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:38,940
is the

1268
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:43,490
the expected risk of my of of my name

1269
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:45,390
function over any

1270
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:46,640
in set

1271
01:41:46,650 --> 01:41:48,600
on the other side of the training set

1272
01:41:48,610 --> 01:41:54,690
so the answer to this is yes we can bound that we can

1273
01:41:54,710 --> 01:42:01,280
i found that putting some condition on how we choose our our set

1274
01:42:02,570 --> 01:42:08,060
the function of the decision space of the function and this common conditions are related

1275
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:08,870
to the

1276
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:12,730
the notion of capacity

1277
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:15,090
so what is the capacity

1278
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:18,360
the capacity of of a set of functions

1279
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:23,340
is the measure of its size or of its complexity

1280
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:24,720
in the

1281
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:31,400
so for each kind of a set of of function it's it's a it's not

1282
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:35,610
an easy it's not easy to define distance measures and

1283
01:42:35,620 --> 01:42:37,930
so for the capacity for example

1284
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:44,240
it is then the largest number h of examples for which there exists for every

1285
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:52,670
a function f from the space which could be used as a perfect classifier so

1286
01:42:52,670 --> 01:42:54,750
for giving you an example here

1287
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:58,180
let's say i have i consider

1288
01:42:58,210 --> 01:43:01,270
the set of all linear classifiers

1289
01:43:02,150 --> 01:43:04,930
two d dimension

1290
01:43:07,090 --> 01:43:08,170
if i have

1291
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:09,500
three points

1292
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:11,410
i say a

1293
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:17,290
this one is is of class one and two others are from from class to

1294
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:19,550
i can separate them

1295
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,070
if these

1296
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:28,040
on the way trained all the things that i always confined classifier

1297
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:34,890
so it's the largest numbers are of examples so if i have treats OK

1298
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:37,120
let's say had four

1299
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:41,040
and i have this one which are of the class blue and these two of

1300
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:41,920
the class

1301
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:44,610
i cannot find classifier

1302
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:47,800
you you are classified

1303
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,630
of this class so the

1304
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:54,340
the capacity of the set of linear our function

1305
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,450
two d

1306
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:59,380
is it is tree

1307
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:02,910
because that's what these sentences

1308
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:09,820
and that is more general for this linear functions

1309
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:17,610
in n dimensions which has also have a capacity of empress one so in classification

1310
01:44:17,610 --> 01:44:20,480
we can compute the value of this page

1311
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:23,320
integration and density estimation

1312
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:25,970
it becomes more difficult

1313
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:29,870
depending on what is the

1314
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:31,080
what is

1315
01:44:31,090 --> 01:44:33,660
the function space

1316
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:37,410
so but there's also way of

1317
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:39,900
of deriving it

1318
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:46,550
having now i have a way to characterize my my

1319
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,770
my function space and

1320
01:44:49,230 --> 01:44:53,120
there's this risk this bound directed by

1321
01:44:53,170 --> 01:44:55,810
by the seventies

1322
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:59,610
looks really ugly but

1323
01:44:59,690 --> 01:45:03,680
is you don't the the difference of a

1324
01:45:03,790 --> 01:45:05,930
the empirical risk and

1325
01:45:05,950 --> 01:45:07,790
the risk

1326
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,340
and the

1327
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:16,540
i see that that can be

1328
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:20,550
seen as as saying exactly what we wanted that

1329
01:45:22,410 --> 01:45:24,980
the two things we wanted which were

1330
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:29,470
that the empirical risk

1331
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:31,970
tends toward the

1332
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:34,390
there the smallest value

1333
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:38,270
of the

1334
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:42,630
risk on the expected risk of my

1335
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:48,130
my optimum function of the training set also tends towards the

1336
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:53,320
the same value then there was go to the same value

1337
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:55,180
and it also

1338
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:59,580
so the the bound from this bound i can also have

1339
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:02,060
he said

1340
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:05,880
this difference and the

1341
01:46:05,890 --> 01:46:11,110
so because here that provides many convergence weight here

1342
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:15,650
which can look when i increase

1343
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:20,060
here what what they have is like a bound of the difference of these two

1344
01:46:20,070 --> 01:46:22,560
value depending on the

1345
01:46:22,570 --> 01:46:24,570
on the capacity

1346
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:25,850
and so

1347
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:32,410
i can interpret this knowing that this efavorite the capacity i have from one side

1348
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:34,150
the empirical risk

1349
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:36,560
which goes up

1350
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:39,330
and the

1351
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:41,860
all the but here

1352
01:46:41,870 --> 01:46:44,090
which goes up

1353
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:47,430
and this the difference

1354
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:49,940
of these two

1355
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:57,650
also the bound on the true ground

1356
01:46:57,670 --> 01:47:02,500
goes up and down weights so it's the sum of the two of these two

1357
01:47:02,510 --> 01:47:04,170
so what does it mean that

1358
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:06,480
there is one point here

1359
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:07,430
in which

1360
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:10,430
four sent a certain amount of capacity

1361
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,720
i have

1362
01:47:12,730 --> 01:47:17,710
and my value of my expected risk of my generalization value

1363
01:47:17,710 --> 01:47:19,080
in this region

1364
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:22,520
in the status of some sort of islamic constructing goals

1365
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:26,330
some of rules may cover examples from the normal class as well

1366
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:29,250
so basically that's why you have this and phase

1367
01:47:29,290 --> 01:47:34,790
when you try basically to eliminate these errors that introduced in this phase basically

1368
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:36,960
all of this point all this

1369
01:47:36,980 --> 01:47:38,650
later because of

1370
01:47:38,650 --> 01:47:41,000
the text by these rules here

1371
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:43,500
will be eliminated in this phase

1372
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:48,100
basically that's why you did so

1373
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:53,400
this and always gives high accuracy and significant support and you know can be very

1374
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:59,130
results when you're dealing with this kind of imbalance datasets

1375
01:47:59,150 --> 01:48:00,610
there is another

1376
01:48:00,630 --> 01:48:02,860
approach co-creators also

1377
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:08,520
by my history article from was the minnesota he used there are people dials

1378
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:11,130
which is some form of decision tree

1379
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:13,130
basically in which

1380
01:48:13,150 --> 01:48:16,610
every node has a predictive rule associated with this

1381
01:48:16,650 --> 01:48:19,060
so this down rules

1382
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:23,610
specialized genetic specialize generic form

1383
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:25,360
of multiphase

1384
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:29,000
you know model so so basically in b and all the model you have two

1385
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:32,130
here basically for every of these

1386
01:48:32,150 --> 01:48:38,150
rules you have the the best sources this so there are again two

1387
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,310
is growth and pruning

1388
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:41,270
in growth

1389
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:46,960
you basically using this people down to cover most of the positive examples and basically

1390
01:48:46,980 --> 01:48:50,190
by doing this he off the training data

1391
01:48:50,210 --> 01:48:52,860
and as a result he will get binary tree

1392
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:55,270
each node is

1393
01:48:55,290 --> 01:48:57,210
characterized by the rule

1394
01:48:57,940 --> 01:49:00,630
the a default class and links to two

1395
01:49:01,730 --> 01:49:07,020
that is this is just the implementation and you have to grow this ripple down

1396
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:09,770
structure in a recursive manner

1397
01:49:09,790 --> 01:49:11,920
and finally in the second phase

1398
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,830
we should approach this the structure in the basically to improve the generalisation it's something

1399
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:21,110
similar how you prune the decision tree in order to

1400
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:26,190
improve the generalization

1401
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:32,980
different people by using different forms of the world

1402
01:49:33,020 --> 01:49:34,520
the metrics tool

1403
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:41,130
apply them or intrusion detection software engineering health applications and so on so this all

1404
01:49:41,150 --> 01:49:44,230
different types of the things people using them both

1405
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:48,420
all the labels were available and i mean i would not go through

1406
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:52,670
most of this because this just modification of regular networks

1407
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:56,520
you have all these kind of references you can go to and

1408
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:02,770
and because there is nothing significantly introduce here people just supply that was so different

1409
01:50:02,790 --> 01:50:04,650
there are class problems and

1410
01:50:04,690 --> 01:50:08,440
what is the typical in the common for most of them that they assume that

1411
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:14,830
support labels from normal and of normal is available to them

1412
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:23,790
people also use different forms of support vector classifier

1413
01:50:23,810 --> 01:50:27,020
to detect intrusions

1414
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:28,690
the main idea

1415
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:31,210
here is basically that

1416
01:50:31,330 --> 01:50:34,190
example this approach based on

1417
01:50:34,190 --> 01:50:38,610
the normal data records can belong to high density data regions

1418
01:50:38,630 --> 01:50:41,110
while the data from

1419
01:50:41,130 --> 01:50:44,790
the data basically that correspond to anomalies correspond to low density

1420
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:45,750
eight regions

1421
01:50:45,770 --> 01:50:50,190
and then he used unsupervised approach to to learn high density and low density data

1422
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:56,650
and then here's the standard support vector machines to classify this data that level

1423
01:50:56,730 --> 01:50:58,020
another approach

1424
01:50:59,250 --> 01:51:00,420
is by

1425
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:01,340
i will come out

1426
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,730
he assumed that he has both

1427
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:06,400
labels available normal and abnormal

1428
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:11,130
and he was the support vector machines for the problem of network intrusion detection so

1429
01:51:11,130 --> 01:51:17,310
i mean this is your application and not significantly is three is here

1430
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:21,130
other type of

1431
01:51:21,830 --> 01:51:25,880
classification techniques for anomaly detection semisupervised to talk about it

1432
01:51:27,330 --> 01:51:29,920
basically they use modified classification

1433
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:33,040
the model to represent normal only

1434
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:37,710
and all the years from this norm here are may correspond to anomalies

1435
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:40,270
so people use different approaches

1436
01:51:40,330 --> 01:51:41,610
people use

1437
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:47,540
neural networks support vector machines some markov model based approaches which can be extremely good

1438
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:52,500
if you have temporal data and you try to capture the transition between the sequences

1439
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:58,860
and finally have different kind of rule based approaches

1440
01:51:58,940 --> 01:52:01,980
so this is

1441
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:08,520
neural network which is called replicator neural network or some people called the oblong your

1442
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:13,170
so the basic idea here is to use this type of

1443
01:52:13,790 --> 01:52:16,690
to learn the normal behavior

1444
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:18,600
so you

1445
01:52:18,610 --> 01:52:22,400
put your input data here this input layer

1446
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:27,310
and you're trying to reconstruct the input data here at the output layer

1447
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:34,020
some form of this neural network is also used for dimensionality reduction so basically trying

1448
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:37,980
reduce the dimension of these

1449
01:52:38,020 --> 01:52:42,230
let's say one hundred space one hundred much space into something small here

1450
01:52:42,290 --> 01:52:46,270
and if you are able to reconstruct your input data from this

1451
01:52:46,290 --> 01:52:48,940
reduce space so basically if you are able to

1452
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:51,360
the same

1453
01:52:51,690 --> 01:52:54,710
data is the data on the input

1454
01:52:54,710 --> 01:53:00,110
you good and basically this layer may you may be used as the reduced dimensionality

1455
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,340
so the idea here is to measure the

1456
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,480
the difference between

1457
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:07,360
output and the input

1458
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:09,750
this is called reconstruction error

1459
01:53:09,770 --> 01:53:12,440
and to use this construction our as the

1460
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,040
outline this so basically the smaller reconstruction error

1461
01:53:18,130 --> 01:53:19,520
that means that

1462
01:53:19,630 --> 01:53:21,580
data should correspond to normal behavior

1463
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:26,540
the logical structure of the data respond to so basically in the training phase

1464
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,150
you have only normal

1465
01:53:28,210 --> 01:53:30,360
you have only normal

1466
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:34,520
data records you best single normal data records of this company let's look at training

1467
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:35,650
this one network

1468
01:53:35,650 --> 01:53:40,040
and and then when you done you know took represent islam which pretty well

1469
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:42,310
so now when you go to the testing phase

1470
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:46,270
every data record that you pass through this electric

1471
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:50,920
will behave in two different ways of this is the normal data record it through

1472
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:54,880
here smaller reconstruction error if this is anomalous data record

1473
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:57,520
it will have a huge construction

1474
01:53:57,580 --> 01:54:01,420
so that's the basic idea

1475
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:09,340
people also use different forms of one class support vector machines to detect anomalies outline

1476
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:15,210
people use different techniques and what the most common approach is basically to separate the

1477
01:54:15,210 --> 01:54:18,420
entire set of training data from the origin

1478
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:21,940
and to find a small region and the most of the data

1479
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:30,190
i mean this in all the different approaches usually you're dealing with

1480
01:54:30,190 --> 01:54:35,400
right so that's a high-level statement of if you make a book code that's what

1481
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:36,550
we want some

1482
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:40,320
the vectors over here that are very different from each other

1483
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:44,900
OK now we want to more concrete prescription of how do make a block

1484
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:49,550
we don't have to do book but let's talk about because anyone suggestion of

1485
01:54:49,570 --> 01:54:53,990
a way of making a block code and an explicit principle of how a block

1486
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:58,530
code could work

1487
01:54:59,070 --> 01:55:04,280
pac that's great who sort of parity checks

1488
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:11,500
so what's the parity check

1489
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:19,630
so we take a source blog

1490
01:55:19,630 --> 01:55:25,070
and then the source what we refer to transmit the source bits in the class

1491
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:28,880
and that was transmitted them

1492
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:33,530
we send an extra bit of possibly more than one activity but you said one

1493
01:55:33,530 --> 01:55:39,440
experiment that is are some of so you have some source bits and

1494
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:43,260
you take a block of and transmit their

1495
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:48,050
and you also transmit their so here's some possible

1496
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:49,510
things you could have

1497
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:54,730
one one zero one zero one and we could add an extra bit

1498
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:57,590
that is the sum of these

1499
01:55:57,610 --> 01:56:01,400
o modulo two one one one is one

1500
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:03,550
one zero is

1501
01:56:03,610 --> 01:56:05,900
zero is an even number of ones

1502
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:06,980
one one

1503
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:16,480
zero more than two years after this is a way of getting from k

1504
01:56:16,610 --> 01:56:21,650
three minutes two and a four

1505
01:56:23,210 --> 01:56:25,110
this is another example

1506
01:56:25,130 --> 01:56:30,360
and the block code it happens to have eight possible inputs here so read this

1507
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:31,920
mapping to four bits

1508
01:56:32,050 --> 01:56:36,230
this would have a rate of three quarters

1509
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:40,720
OK we've got going the idea of we want to make a long things and

1510
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:43,760
we want to be different from each other and maybe we can use parity checks

1511
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:47,480
i'm not going to tell you one of the first block codes that was invented

1512
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:50,340
it was invented by a guy called

1513
01:56:52,690 --> 01:56:54,230
and it's called the seventy four

1514
01:56:54,230 --> 01:56:59,920
hamming code

1515
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:01,710
and it looks like this

1516
01:57:01,730 --> 01:57:04,530
it's going to map all

1517
01:57:08,150 --> 01:57:10,920
seven minutes

1518
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:12,500
and it's going work by

1519
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:14,360
sending the first

1520
01:57:14,420 --> 01:57:18,840
sending in the four bits in the clear and then attending another three parity bits

1521
01:57:19,130 --> 01:57:22,000
that are made in this sort of way i'm going to show you exactly how

1522
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:28,860
and so we right before frostbitten has one s two s three s four

1523
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:31,780
we call this

1524
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:37,340
t five t six and t seven these of the parity bits which we have

1525
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:42,150
and afterwards and the parity bits are going to be set in such a way

1526
01:57:42,190 --> 01:57:45,920
that the number of ones in each circle

1527
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:47,300
is an even

1528
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:49,900
let me give you an example

1529
01:58:02,150 --> 01:58:04,610
let's imagine that this

1530
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,880
one zero zero zero

1531
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:12,760
that's going to turn into t of length seven

1532
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:16,880
and we do it by writing as the circle

1533
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:22,780
here we go one zero zero zero and now we set the others

1534
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:27,730
eighty six t seven such as the number of ones in this article is even

1535
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:29,650
that means we need one

1536
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:31,650
and then

1537
01:58:31,710 --> 01:58:33,090
this page is zero

1538
01:58:35,170 --> 01:58:35,980
and here

1539
01:58:36,010 --> 01:58:38,420
many to one

1540
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:42,630
OK that was the encoder

1541
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:46,150
here's a few more examples

1542
01:58:47,730 --> 01:58:53,280
please talk to neighbour and fill in encodings for those and will have a three

1543
01:58:54,110 --> 01:58:57,010
breakthrough to chat about everything has been going on

1544
01:58:57,030 --> 01:58:59,400
any questions

1545
01:59:03,230 --> 01:59:06,010
let's just checked that we all agree on this

1546
01:59:06,050 --> 01:59:10,570
so you transmit zero one one and the right rear one

1547
01:59:12,090 --> 01:59:14,130
and one zero

1548
01:59:14,150 --> 01:59:15,860
and the fact that one

1549
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:16,960
there there

1550
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:22,320
and this is a list of obviously sixteen possibilities inherent just giving four of them

1551
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:25,570
and this final one one one one one one

1552
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:30,210
one way we could have got this is all of these particular encoding operations were

1553
01:59:30,210 --> 01:59:33,050
doing here are linear involved modulo two

1554
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:36,900
in addition which is a linear operation and we could have noticed one thousand and

1555
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:40,420
zero one one them and you get all

1556
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:44,610
so we can add this to this and this

1557
01:59:44,670 --> 01:59:47,900
these two codewords added gives you that code

1558
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:51,630
so this is an example of what's called a linear

1559
01:59:53,150 --> 01:59:56,010
we don't have to do that is just an example

1560
01:59:56,070 --> 01:59:57,510
of one

1561
01:59:58,460 --> 02:00:00,880
OK so we send

1562
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:03,940
this transmission over a channel

1563
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,800
and something happens

1564
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:10,150
let's and the one for for example let's pretend we didn't know that was what

1565
02:00:10,150 --> 02:00:15,690
was sent so will no doubt that actually transmitted

1566
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:18,610
well on

1567
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:26,480
will keep that information secret from ourselves from now on i will say let's imagine

1568
02:00:26,570 --> 02:00:28,820
what we receive is less

1569
02:00:29,210 --> 02:00:31,980
three flip one bit without telling ourselves

1570
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:34,530
let's imagine we receive one one

1571
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:37,530
zero zero one zero one

1572
02:00:38,730 --> 02:00:42,230
and we don't know what was transmitted and now what we do this we need

1573
02:00:42,230 --> 02:00:46,010
to invent decoder

1574
02:00:46,110 --> 02:00:52,030
what's the general decoding algorithm well we could write bayes theorem enumerate all hypotheses the

1575
02:00:52,030 --> 02:00:53,150
sixteen of them

1576
02:00:53,150 --> 02:00:56,340
and we can about how probable they are and we know

1577
02:00:56,380 --> 02:01:00,800
the most probable hypothesis will be the transmission hypothesis

1578
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:04,420
it involves the smallest number of flips so that's two ways of saying what we

1579
02:01:04,530 --> 02:01:09,630
want to look at all sixteen hypotheses find the most probable one of the one

1580
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:11,250
for the season

1581
02:01:13,050 --> 02:01:16,460
OK well this is something that

1582
02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:18,770
you need to know that is you want

1583
02:01:23,150 --> 02:01:25,840
why so

1584
02:01:25,860 --> 02:01:27,550
one way

1585
02:01:27,550 --> 02:01:30,820
so large your

1586
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:36,380
so what watching paint dry what was really

1587
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:41,610
seventy percent

1588
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:47,110
showed up without knowing it to your

1589
02:01:47,130 --> 02:01:50,040
computer viruses

1590
02:01:50,050 --> 02:01:52,960
the we can

1591
02:01:53,110 --> 02:01:55,940
the same way that almost anywhere in the world

1592
02:01:55,960 --> 02:02:01,800
north korea cuba and the first it's you are read

1593
02:02:05,380 --> 02:02:09,550
one the closest all the more this is closely

1594
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:13,730
of twelve and we want to

1595
02:02:13,730 --> 02:02:18,590
that telephone the most lottery you know several

1596
02:02:18,610 --> 02:02:23,110
trying so so the telephone is really really about

1597
02:02:23,130 --> 02:02:24,670
one way forward

1598
02:02:24,690 --> 02:02:29,130
on the other side

1599
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:35,630
we know that he was late we're changing jacobs your many years she would like

1600
02:02:35,770 --> 02:02:38,000
their cities and then

1601
02:02:41,770 --> 02:02:44,920
i found that i really keep going

1602
02:02:45,050 --> 02:02:50,730
he said there was only space for licence you know in some problems

1603
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:57,440
actually experience the one fringes is broken changing relationship to say

1604
02:02:57,460 --> 02:03:01,840
so that experience

1605
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:08,130
it's one of those urban legends i've seen a when i

1606
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:10,960
one of these cruiser that was

1607
02:03:10,980 --> 02:03:15,050
this is the environment world we know

1608
02:03:15,050 --> 02:03:16,230
from one

1609
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:17,690
you have

1610
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:19,320
many of

1611
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:23,250
messages so although

1612
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:24,400
in fact

1613
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:27,840
among university students my colleague random killing

1614
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:33,750
the most common usage among university students is falling five minutes before it arrived place

1615
02:03:33,750 --> 02:03:39,090
most change

1616
02:03:39,090 --> 02:03:47,440
all very coarsely face-to-face that you know that was wonderful and i also

1617
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:53,670
do some gossip so this is the place where the goal of the school

1618
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:04,300
it was a somewhat different cultures

1619
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:05,590
so the

1620
02:04:05,610 --> 02:04:10,780
o similar to the citizens

1621
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:17,710
you're sixteen year two hundred sixteen were there

1622
02:04:17,770 --> 02:04:19,400
notice from the right

1623
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:29,570
so we're always accessible and we want to

1624
02:04:29,590 --> 02:04:33,050
and so this needs to be said more about

1625
02:04:33,070 --> 02:04:34,550
we can always on

1626
02:04:36,250 --> 02:04:40,550
on the basis that what you see here is that this is a

1627
02:04:41,210 --> 02:04:43,150
i expect you to know that

1628
02:04:43,170 --> 02:04:45,300
reason for the potential

1629
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:48,130
by experience that

1630
02:04:53,860 --> 02:05:00,230
we have to go through some of these tools

1631
02:05:00,250 --> 02:05:01,710
do you want

1632
02:05:01,730 --> 02:05:02,610
the real

1633
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:10,770
what more well known

1634
02:05:10,820 --> 02:05:16,520
internet sense to see

1635
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:18,610
the rocky horror show

1636
02:05:18,690 --> 02:05:21,110
by right to

1637
02:05:21,170 --> 02:05:25,960
get weaker as

1638
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:30,380
the other thing that i wanted has a really interesting

1639
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:32,920
although follow

1640
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:35,590
for all the parents

1641
02:05:35,610 --> 02:05:39,070
so this is really doing

1642
02:05:40,980 --> 02:05:43,340
if they call it

1643
02:05:43,550 --> 02:05:53,400
there's not much

1644
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:58,610
three we to take some stories and its

1645
02:05:58,630 --> 02:06:00,940
you know the policies better

1646
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:04,800
roman holiday

1647
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:06,020
great movie

1648
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:10,070
or to separate these she's the princess one

1649
02:06:10,090 --> 02:06:14,500
message to garcia of this kind and this is for you

1650
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:16,460
since and that

1651
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:23,320
one of the first america's wars

1652
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:24,730
eighty nine

1653
02:06:24,750 --> 02:06:33,440
extensions so see us all and it's going down was going to happen

1654
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:42,360
say something about fifty percent in america is very much you know you're

1655
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:45,020
almost like

1656
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:48,520
kind of get your head around recursion you can look at that and say i

1657
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:53,760
can write a five line function that will solve that problem and this is the

1658
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:57,590
kind of power we're going to give you up with our together so there's a

1659
02:06:57,590 --> 02:07:02,390
bunch of really amazing theoretical and algorithmic stuff to explore the that really increases the

1660
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:06,790
things you can do with programming so i'm

1661
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:08,420
first we find it

1662
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:14,230
and as well has always i think the section leading program right that we have

1663
02:07:14,230 --> 02:07:18,310
created and for is a huge part of what makes someone a six-course successful and

1664
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:25,000
having somebody who's individually kind of working with few meeting with weekly and giving you

1665
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,700
that feedback the individual person personalized for you in helping you get to the response

1666
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:33,080
is a lot of what helps to make the experience very fun and kind very

1667
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:38,320
personal to sell and metal for second like what six to have here

1668
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:42,720
number one was that the section leaders where are they don't

1669
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:48,190
nevertheless i not know when i was going to class the role

1670
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:51,810
i think going to go somewhere else with the wrong will get them

1671
02:07:53,390 --> 02:07:54,370
and so

1672
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:56,650
one of the great you agree

1673
02:07:56,670 --> 02:07:58,610
well i convinced you are you sure

1674
02:07:58,630 --> 02:08:01,030
is anybody still hesitant

1675
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:04,100
something else you worried about that i can tell you is the big deal is

1676
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:06,010
a lot of work to do

1677
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:12,010
just i just exude just osmosis you're

1678
02:08:12,010 --> 02:08:16,240
OK i want to know about logistics because

1679
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:17,560
there are some

1680
02:08:17,620 --> 02:08:21,060
just random things right that you may want to know about how past works that

1681
02:08:21,670 --> 02:08:23,170
the first m supposed to do

1682
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:32,330
one intermediate monday wednesday friday two fifteen three o five in glorious downtown scaling auditorium

1683
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:36,960
it looks like we almost exactly fit classroom which is means were all to be

1684
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:38,290
very friendly and cosy

1685
02:08:38,870 --> 02:08:45,490
the lectures are being taped available online and that has the nice side-effect that you

1686
02:08:45,490 --> 02:08:48,710
can watch them you can review them later you can watch them lots of time

1687
02:08:48,710 --> 02:08:52,810
to write it also means that we're pouring rain you're sitting on your bunny slippers

1688
02:08:52,810 --> 02:08:55,790
you could just say hey i'm not going outside you you could turn on your

1689
02:08:55,790 --> 02:09:00,740
computer and watch i'm a big fan having common person that's because one lecture in

1690
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:04,820
the room but i also think there's a there's an interaction there i went through

1691
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:09,540
the human human thing that i'm i'm confined and so i hope that you will

1692
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:11,050
make every effort to ten person

1693
02:09:11,490 --> 02:09:14,090
as much as you can but it is nice to know that if you do

1694
02:09:14,090 --> 02:09:15,270
miss lecture or you

1695
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:17,790
you know

1696
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:21,710
get caught up with something you have a chance to review it later online and

1697
02:09:21,740 --> 02:09:25,320
will have sections that will meet once a week just like one six a and

1698
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:29,610
section leader right who meet with you to discuss section is the one the radio

1699
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:32,040
programs and sitting with union the conferences with them

1700
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:35,700
what you need to do to get yourself in this section by section titles and

1701
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:40,120
access and they're just totally bogus so ignore all that what you do is you

1702
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:43,870
go to the online if you are class web page there's a link that

1703
02:09:43,890 --> 02:09:47,350
so yes section section on right now but they will go up tomorrow and will

1704
02:09:47,350 --> 02:09:49,850
be up for the weekend and you go going you put in your preferences about

1705
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:53,050
what times they understand or not and there's this big

1706
02:09:53,070 --> 02:09:58,320
get you get computer program created does the magic matching the gets everybody into section

1707
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:04,170
that fits into their schedule that what happened by early next week

1708
02:10:04,390 --> 02:10:10,050
so the the sun up from thirty five to seventy five technically so if you

1709
02:10:10,050 --> 02:10:12,990
if by some five years section here you know you've got a set of specs

1710
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:16,770
then find if you happen to change after spending five mechanisms made at that point

1711
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:21,180
it's a little bit harder we can we can make adjustments but it's very case-by-case

1712
02:10:21,180 --> 02:10:24,000
basis that where we have space and where we can accommodate is so the best

1713
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,310
thing you can do is buy certified have a pretty clear idea what you can

1714
02:10:27,310 --> 02:10:30,200
and cannot do i mean always the preferences and then we just pick things that

1715
02:10:30,200 --> 02:10:33,630
you know will work no matter what happens if anything it's variable maybe just don't

1716
02:10:33,630 --> 02:10:35,870
offer things that you know might go away

1717
02:10:35,900 --> 02:10:39,770
so there's a list of you know twenty times and you say all that i

1718
02:10:39,770 --> 02:10:43,260
can make these five and that way you will get yourself in trouble on one

1719
02:10:43,340 --> 02:10:44,750
that might change

1720
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:50,300
the the workload everybody was was no one much work it's o five class into

1721
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:52,210
five units engineering class

1722
02:10:53,530 --> 02:10:56,790
you you get your five units were

1723
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:01,630
i would say so don't don't worry about that i'm not sure changes

1724
02:11:01,650 --> 02:11:06,070
we we have a problem is identified what we think there's seven of them across

1725
02:11:06,070 --> 02:11:07,260
ten weeks so

1726
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:12,020
you can kind calculated out but we can third for any particular one the students

1727
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:16,190
report that it's you know about fifteen or twenty our project each of them some

1728
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:19,420
people get done less than that simple take a little bit more but i would

1729
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:21,550
say that's kind of the

1730
02:11:21,570 --> 02:11:26,520
mode range for what people are reporting i do think that the people who report

1731
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:30,510
last some of those are actually innocent but is very naturally gifted and in one

1732
02:11:30,510 --> 02:11:32,990
of the one that has to with your habits about how you work and how

1733
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:36,370
you make progress if you're with the people who feels he might be more likely

1734
02:11:36,370 --> 02:11:38,490
to be on the other hand you can come and talk to me and i

1735
02:11:38,490 --> 02:11:41,530
can give you some suggestions in particular things like choosing to work in the layer

1736
02:11:41,530 --> 02:11:47,320
where the helpers are on duty hatches really positive effects in that when you get

1737
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:50,480
stuck right you easy access to somebody helping you work through it rather than spending

1738
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:53,980
an hour to kind of fighting something that turns it becomes simple but just require

1739
02:11:53,990 --> 02:11:58,190
knowing something that you didn't know it although i am a big fan of learning

1740
02:11:58,190 --> 02:12:02,100
things yourself there's also times when actually a well placed a bit of advice from

1741
02:12:02,100 --> 02:12:04,100
somebody can save a lot of time so

1742
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:10,900
the image and the final exam will be kind of an in class so not

1743
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:16,020
take home open book open notes is actually technically outclassed having night because we need

1744
02:12:16,020 --> 02:12:20,150
more than fifty minute period to to get any coverage of that then final exam

1745
02:12:20,150 --> 02:12:27,080
schedule university scheduled slot sadly that is very very very and the exam week but

1746
02:12:27,080 --> 02:12:30,510
that's when the register put us and that's what we need to go so you

1747
02:12:30,510 --> 02:12:32,530
may want to take a look at that before you

1748
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:34,130
head to acapulco

1749
02:12:34,140 --> 02:12:38,620
for spring break to make sure you here for example the

1750
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:39,970
i well

1751
02:12:39,980 --> 02:12:45,230
you know i have a publisher will not allow me to distribute commercially electronically a

1752
02:12:45,230 --> 02:12:47,700
they're not exactly right in the modern age on this so

1753
02:12:50,280 --> 02:12:53,870
no i'm i'm working on on it is the truth so that you know by

1754
02:12:53,870 --> 02:12:57,690
the time the world's hopefully will have some other strategy but we we currently are

1755
02:12:57,690 --> 02:12:59,810
in negotiation let's say but they are not

1756
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:03,440
the nice thing about the course reader is we have not changed in the last

1757
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:07,360
years of you know somebody hasn't from my fall last brains like that it has

1758
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:10,530
some minor edits typos were fixed but so if you can get hold old one

1759
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:12,770
and it's good we are

1760
02:13:12,770 --> 02:13:17,740
getting the royalties publishing and production costs so it's actually you know what would have

1761
02:13:17,740 --> 02:13:23,950
