1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,290
that you would actually

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,730
try and to minimize this

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,370
so this only we'll start making scenes

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,100
as soon as we replace

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:16,160
this one up upon which actually takes into account

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,390
this is the

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,850
really really

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,020
wonderful trick

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,980
well structured estimation

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,500
so if you have a problem of that time

11
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,100
you've got some loss delta upon

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,730
one for instance

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:38,480
subject to well where the spies given as the argmin some problems

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,520
then i can find convex upper bound on this

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,120
simply through the barracks i excised great recording

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,140
in this case it was written out

17
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,310
one minus fighters per se

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,190
so this is

19
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,100
this is something that is the optimal solution

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,870
i promise

21
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,750
well any other ones

22
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,640
plus delta of apart from and one for all platforms

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,670
this looks like a bit at talk

24
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,350
but it's actually fairly straightforward principle now

25
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,160
how can we show that this is an upper bound on this expression here

26
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,500
well there is

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,460
well just plug-and-play chronicles by

28
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,120
that's since four pi

29
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,940
this is the argmin

30
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,000
apply transpose c

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,410
this term here

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,980
it's going to be great frequency of right

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,980
so the

34
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,000
and here we already have delta find one

35
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,620
now i have size great something

36
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,690
the term that i actually want to bound so therefore clearly the upper bound holds

37
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,520
so it's really easy to show

38
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,620
sometimes people rescale the margin here

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,960
and that actually tends to work much better if you can afford it

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,190
the trouble is here we cannot really afford several were to rescale

41
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,250
so this thing actually plays the role of the margin and it explain a little

42
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,600
bit ly

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,540
so this is the discrepancy between the correct score

44
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,460
well for any other permutation

45
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,730
but if this quantity here

46
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,160
is positive it means i'm in trouble

47
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,140
was if this quantity is positive then y prime

48
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,520
it will be

49
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,120
a bit to minimize of fighters per se

50
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,350
then the one is the identity permutation

51
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,540
now what i'm actually doing it

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,520
i'm going to add to this

53
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,980
the loss

54
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,350
many basically how much it costs me

55
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,430
by using pi prime

56
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,690
instead of the ones

57
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,500
well match

58
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,310
so what this does is it

59
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,690
good large margins

60
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,270
permutations pi prime

61
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,210
which would correspond to really disastrous match

62
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,640
so that's the multiclass large margin principle

63
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,020
i guess most of you when you drive a car

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,730
actually by the

65
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,160
the large margin principle

66
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,600
so for instance if you drive along the highway and it's really really smooth on

67
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,350
the side well maybe you're a little bit less careful and may be stray bits

68
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,040
assigned right at least i sometimes do that families

69
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,020
on the other hand if i drive mountainous road

70
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,290
and there is a

71
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,390
big gap on the side

72
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,830
and there is a huge danger that might just fall off i will try my

73
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,230
darndest actually stay away from that

74
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,330
so i will try to keep is larger margin is possible between this gap

75
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,940
which would be disastrous

76
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,040
and where am

77
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,160
and this is really just doing the same thing in equations here

78
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,160
anyway this is the key slide

79
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,440
of the entire presentation

80
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,080
in terms of the optimisation problem

81
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,460
don't worry

82
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,640
there's lots of pictures here

83
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,750
will get through in time so if you do that we can write about our

84
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:11,100
optimisation problems so remember before that here we have those losses are for matching well

85
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,930
some graphs in may be suboptimal way

86
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,040
here we just have replaced by this upper bound

87
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,390
it's clear to see that this is a common convex then it's linear constraint imply

88
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,370
and exciting

89
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,690
because i mean this is really just by trying to expose one

90
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,170
and so i get this constraint here

91
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,500
it's not for a convex optimization problem

92
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,370
and the other thing that's happened is

93
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,000
i've really made the scale of the seas match

94
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,290
so this is basically what fixes

95
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,770
the reason why have used the north of the square is regularizer

96
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,310
so now if i scale c to be very small all sorts of the bad

97
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,140
large margin solutions are going to take over so this prevents me from having just

98
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,710
a scale that goes to zero

99
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,640
and so i will actually have an effective regularizer

100
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,730
now we've got a convex problem great

101
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,940
but we pay for it very dealing with the exponential number of constraints

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,100
so we need to find the most violated constraint efficiently

103
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,560
but fortunately that again is solved by linear sound

104
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,410
so if you look at this line here and yes what's the point

105
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,670
which maximizes the right inside well that's just a linear sound from this is linear

106
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,620
and what do they do is

107
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,310
you just find the rest permutation

108
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,370
and then

109
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,770
at this to a subset of constraints to minimize for those constraints defined and express

110
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,980
constraints keep an interesting

111
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,930
now what's really happening here

112
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,290
so this is

113
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:02,370
the expectation is with respect to the stochastic component of a statistical models

114
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,810
and again for those of you familiar with second year undergraduate statistics will know the

115
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,350
covariance can be written as the expectation of the outer product of a random variable

116
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,950
or random vector minus the outer product of the mean

117
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,890
random vector

118
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,830
so we want to get an expression

119
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,160
for these terms here

120
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,140
no the maximum likelihood estimator

121
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,990
this is one of the reasons why maximum likelihood and unlikelihood present principle is

122
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,050
a very general principle and

123
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,680
it's one of which you will use and

124
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,950
we more or less all the time

125
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,950
if you want to

126
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,390
but the forward backward recursions of the hidden markov model fall from

127
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:59,450
maximizing the likelihood of your sequence given the markov property of the hidden markov properties

128
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:04,740
of the model so the likelihood principle is is one which is very general and

129
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,830
for good reason

130
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,080
it provides an unbiased estimator

131
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,200
what does that mean that means that if you have enough observations

132
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,490
and your model happens to be

133
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,180
true in the sense that it accurately

134
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,470
process by which the data set has been produced

135
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,080
then the parameters of that model

136
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,430
the estimates of the parameters of that model

137
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,910
if you use maximum likelihood will be unbiased other words you will tend towards the

138
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,080
true parameter values in the asymptotic limit

139
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,780
so it's comforting to know that this estimator will be unbiased so in other words

140
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,330
the expectation

141
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,850
estimated w heart

142
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:56,200
well actually the w where w and the two model parameters

143
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:10,970
the convention itself the expectation of w heart is equal to w

144
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:20,720
if you can convince yourself again grabbed me in the lecture india

145
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,030
there's a philosophical question here of course

146
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,240
george box

147
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,240
chemist and statistician is

148
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,390
quoted as saying all models are wrong

149
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,120
but some are useful

150
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,990
so far models are wrong

151
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,760
right and all models that you use and my and machine learning will typically be

152
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,160
all in the sense that they do not

153
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,870
accurately reflect

154
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,350
the process by which the data was was observed

155
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,740
and then doesn't make any sense

156
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,470
to have an unbiased estimator

157
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,550
real in the next lecture when i want to the bayesian methodology then this whole

158
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,640
question will arise yet again

159
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,260
and we'll see that in actual fact

160
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,680
it's quite a sensible question to ask but for the time being

161
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,390
let's take comfort in the fact that

162
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,140
if our model does indeed reflect the truth

163
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,870
an unbiased estimator is a good to half

164
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:32,330
OK so already and we have this part of the expression here

165
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,370
so this is just going to be w w transpose w two

166
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,950
model parameters so it just requires this matrix of

167
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,720
second order

168
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,720
for w

169
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,640
so how do we get

170
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,080
we know that w hat is this

171
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,260
this thing here

172
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,830
so let's just take the

173
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,430
o to product of these two things

174
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,010
OK so this is

175
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,510
BBC linear algebra so we just have this this here

176
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,700
now remember these here

177
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,280
these axes are given there's no stochastic

178
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:15,260
under this model element e of human stochastic component that we have the other target

179
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,430
so when we take the expectation with respect to w heart w heart transport was

180
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,950
because this whole thing is is is basically linear

181
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,350
the expectation operator

182
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,930
is going to operate on

183
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,760
he transpose

184
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,010
again i'm going to run through this quite quickly so that i don't hold you

185
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,010
back from your coffee but

186
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,140
for those of you who

187
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:50,600
i don't quite follow this can up in the laboratory or don't the corresponding lecture

188
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,180
notes which when the into the system

189
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,830
and a lot more detail

190
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,740
but in any case we need to get an expression for the expectation of t

191
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,010
he transports

192
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,760
our model a statistical model is basically t plus the deterministic component and then the

193
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:13,990
noise component so again we take the outer product and apply the expectation operator

194
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,810
so when we expand this

195
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:21,030
we see that we have no remember this w is the true model parameter so

196
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,530
this is deterministic so there will be no expectation

197
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,160
the expectation operator will operate on s

198
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,370
this is a stochastic elements on noise are enough

199
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:39,330
again this is deterministic and then we have the outer product of our entertainment

200
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,220
so the expectation

201
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,660
will just operate on e and e transpose

202
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,930
now what is the expectation of epsilon

203
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,970
and the expectation of the transpose

204
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,700
i sigma square

205
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,450
so this block so this just becomes an identity

206
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,780
scale by sigma square this is just the deterministic component so we have this good

207
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,080
now we can close this

208
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,600
and two e w hard w had transpose

209
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,890
and we end up with

210
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,310
if you want to go through it it's fairly trivial but

211
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,350
so we have this part of the true parameter values and then this

212
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,450
oddly familiar looking matrix here

213
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,560
and if we plug everything together

214
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,740
then the overall covariance

215
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,220
so we have our

216
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,870
corresponding to the expectation of the product of the

217
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,620
maximum likelihood estimator

218
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,120
we have this component here which councils

219
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,890
and we find that the covariance matrix

220
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,950
associated with the maximum likelihood estimator

221
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,260
is equal to this thing here

222
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,370
now remember

223
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,350
well people who does this come from

224
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,430
you should remember

225
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:15,220
this is actually the second derivatives of the likelihood with respect to the

226
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,140
the model parameters

227
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,370
the covariance

228
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,280
that you can relate this to consistency

229
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,270
it's got it slows down a bit today

230
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,540
to do that

231
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,860
which is about two pages

232
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,280
to build a very simple so i'm not going to do right now because i

233
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,450
want to get going on this topic

234
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,950
and so i will give you that if tomorrow i'll just put it in the

235
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,460
and then you have to pick up

236
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,160
but what the next step what we're in our exposition is to say is this

237
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,370
thing called cut conserve conservation or conservation result

238
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,460
which yields trying to achieve but it turns out

239
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,350
but that attempt to try and achieve that is the same as trying to show

240
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,890
that certain formal systems are consistent

241
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,020
i consistent mean that

242
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,600
you know we want to prove

243
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,850
but the former and negation

244
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,230
we want to prove some bad things like zero equals one

245
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,240
because we already have presumably if it's good enough for mathematics

246
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,790
we already have

247
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,150
zero on a long proven theory

248
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,400
so i think you just proved this thing we now theorem here is inconsistent things

249
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,360
like that

250
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,790
so we're talking about the consistency of the theory

251
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,940
i guess

252
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,360
that's the for next topic

253
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,940
well this is where negative results again kick kicking

254
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,870
it turns out just going to jump over the slide in the next because they

255
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,230
start to say i really apologize this

256
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,140
that i start to give you a brief outline of proof idea

257
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,570
and then i don't know how to brain seizures something and i didn't put it

258
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:03,830
which was sold by because just simple like you be nice to have slides

259
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,540
so t tomorrow morning

260
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,940
but what i will say is that in effect

261
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,090
of some

262
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,990
the system propose formalisation mathematics that is consistent

263
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,710
would be sufficient for

264
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,370
this conservation ideas all the data

265
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,730
but the hunters on to see if we could prove one of these formal systems

266
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,440
among other things that's what

267
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,820
falls out of all this work is that we can't do that

268
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,450
can't find

269
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,730
proof of the sort of looking for

270
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,070
well established some the ideal theory

271
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,220
some ideal theory is itself consistent

272
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,400
we believe it's consistent

273
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,580
we can act on that basis but we don't know is inconsistent certainly not

274
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,420
so we can find formal proof that it is not able to

275
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:02,920
that's the support of all these there is

276
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,230
so here's the particular theorem which will be working towards

277
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,600
and so the crime that they live in their villages try and sort of

278
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,790
i just read out once and then

279
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,370
then we'll continue from there to try and show you the steps that would lead

280
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,690
up to this thing

281
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,620
i think in the last and jeffrey

282
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,030
this is theorem four chapter fifteen OK so we're not just going to get like

283
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,670
that that's fine

284
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,710
the key idea we model so right now

285
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,910
the key idea

286
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,530
is the girl coco go this time

287
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,920
also quite young

288
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,740
and working in this area called program found away

289
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,300
to encode

290
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,330
in two

291
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,950
arithmetic itself

292
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,990
yes i realize that you could

293
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,490
set up key

294
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,020
the maps and things like that between the symbols of the formulas

295
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,510
and indeed the derivations the strings the whole form being put together this cube map

296
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,280
all at over two

297
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,010
statements in arithmetic

298
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,870
so these theories depend on you for proof depending on using arithmetic to code the

299
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,440
met metatheria formal theory

300
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,740
and then when you do that it turns out that there are

301
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,510
some problems

302
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,150
if is sufficiently strong which we want to be one of l'express mathematics so his

303
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,510
one state fear

304
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,850
suppose t the theory

305
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,290
formal theory containing arithmetic

306
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,120
then there's the sentence far

307
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,720
which encoding

308
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,130
asserts its own un provability

309
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,590
so this sentence somehow says

310
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,880
but it's not

311
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,830
there's an kind of the derivation of this of this form so far so good

312
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,010
they can be sentences which

313
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,750
i don't have

314
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,800
during the trouble because they're not they're kind

315
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,050
but it has these for the properties

316
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,710
if t is consistent

317
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,270
t will then t one have five

318
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,960
five theorem

319
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,040
and another property called omega consistency usually from

320
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,220
well now

321
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,900
this is just what we establish in here

322
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,540
assuming it is consistent

323
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,980
one be the case that this five thing

324
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,710
is in is in our theory of arithmetic

325
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,220
but intuitively

326
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,670
the sentence phi stu is true

327
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,140
it is unprovable

328
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,040
and it's it's that's what intention of the coating

329
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,020
is that says that central

330
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,180
so here's the formula which intuitively is true it's the truth arithmetic

331
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,380
it's got this property the property that is there

332
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,230
right now i

333
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,070
OK that assuming that the theory is consistent one the two

334
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,520
we're stuck

335
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,510
we exhibited we calculate we can find a way of showing that

336
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,820
t essentially files to capture all of mathematics

337
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,060
and this is consistent

338
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,470
let's it's inconsistent sorry

339
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,230
t is incomplete

340
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,520
on this assumption

341
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,500
there's a fairly can be working away towards thinking about how you how you get

342
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,520
to that structure how the coding works

343
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,460
we talk about mapping

344
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,490
or even having a reasonable idea of calculating

345
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:26,990
o or cow having calculate built inside formal theories

346
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,930
i got a little

347
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,770
discussion point here

348
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,970
again the on that moment

349
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,350
given time and we try and

350
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:43,720
i will try and get back to that one

351
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,140
are just tell the idea will do that for six

352
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,340
so here's my question

353
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,820
we assume got some theory

354
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,010
formalise arithmetic

355
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,270
it would be reasonable to assume

356
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,080
the antecedent of the roman one

357
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,520
if t is consistent then we want the other things

358
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,830
the idea is that

359
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,900
you place

360
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:16,070
that's that's the greek letters on the gas and that's a stronger form of consistent

361
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,280
i let that one go and it's this

362
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,640
so because consistency

363
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,260
it was this idea we didn't have something in negation

364
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,670
now i know i'm ready for the

365
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,110
so what's here

366
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,900
which are two

367
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,150
so called the little plastic equation

368
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,340
now with now so this this is like the key key

369
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,050
we're going to a lot of solutions but can we solve it with the delta

370
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,510
and i can i solved qxx is be our two-dimensional delta function

371
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,340
u y y equals

372
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,650
a delta function at zero zero

373
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,150
later i would like to solve it with the delta function

374
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,090
at some other point

375
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,300
x not why not

376
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,090
know so this is a point source

377
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,260
so what i wanted

378
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,190
i solving physically with this with this case

379
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,510
it's like fluid is

380
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,300
a going away

381
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,380
and it's

382
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,470
there is applied

383
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,760
at the the origin feeding fluid and you see what the picture would be like

384
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,650
as a source of point source at the origin

385
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,170
or at some other point

386
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,590
and it's

387
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,840
it's providing fluid which is traveling away no other sources

388
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,970
everywhere else the delta function is zero but at one point

389
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,670
we have a true point source

390
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:59,280
so this is the kind of problem you would solve an essay analyzing boston harbour

391
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:06,440
it's got its certain sources and what's what travels around and and then i would

392
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,860
also if if

393
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,630
just to say what i want to give him i would also like to solve

394
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,970
the problem with with source on the boundary

395
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,650
and the boundary values instead of the right hand side is all come to the

396
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,860
OK let me tackle this guy

397
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,840
well you can imagine what we need is

398
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,090
like a good guess

399
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,320
here's a good guess i think

400
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,360
i'm going to get a pair again

401
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,860
so i'm think of my function

402
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,650
given a the real part of the EU and then all well so what

403
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,590
actually you can predict here

404
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,860
what will be my

405
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,740
my geometry picture if i have

406
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,320
you can guess what what's what's the flow going to do

407
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,150
it shows up at this

408
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,690
centre and

409
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,610
it's got no other reason

410
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,150
choose any particular direction so we're willing to do

411
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,670
don't allow radio

412
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,220
so the goal

413
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,570
radio streamlined streamlines will be radio

414
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,920
these will be the lines as

415
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,920
and if this and then i want curves are perpendicular to those rays out from

416
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,300
the origin

417
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,030
circles around the origin so those will be

418
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,840
those would be the

419
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:50,630
potential equipotential u we'll hands OK let's see if we can make that happen

420
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,780
you equal cost obvious circle

421
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,740
and a single constantly already

422
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:03,570
OK well here's the hair function look at the logarithm

423
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,610
of c

424
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,990
that's interesting function

425
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,550
the figure out what it is

426
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,760
OK so

427
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,820
so we use

428
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,690
experts i y

429
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,700
or are either i theta

430
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,220
sorry i think better right because the logarithm of a sum is who knows

431
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,920
but the log of product is

432
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:36,300
can be because the product is the logarithm of this term

433
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,470
one of the other term was the log of the other terms

434
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,840
what's the logarithm of the the i say that

435
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,840
it's just so i say the right size

436
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,800
so what we

437
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,900
what we got here now we take the real part is

438
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,320
like technique you take the real part is this is are you

439
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:06,300
and take the imaginary part in this is RS

440
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,490
it was really easy

441
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:16,170
and to the UMTS and others that match

442
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,070
so so far i just

443
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,990
i suggested this function

444
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,130
but now notice how it doesn't match the picture

445
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:30,700
because the lines as stable constant are legal constant those arrays

446
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,840
and the lines

447
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,590
of our equal councillor circles

448
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,610
fogaras six

449
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,220
there are is

450
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,540
searching for twelve fourteen i go up to the top

451
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,720
and i love

452
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,750
does it

453
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,100
twelve fourteen doesn't overlap here

454
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,430
i looked at eighteen and it's it's greater so i go left

455
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,540
and then look here

456
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,410
does it overlaps

457
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,370
so then what happens

458
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,700
i looked at the left

459
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,830
says i go right

460
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,140
look here

461
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,200
then i go and i look the left it says no go right

462
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,750
i go here which is now

463
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,700
and now it's now

464
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,430
i returned no

465
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,520
and does twelve fourteen

466
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,430
overlap anything in the sense

467
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,500
so therefore it always works

468
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:41,930
so when the correctness in a minute

469
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,790
let's just do our analysis first

470
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,850
so we don't have to

471
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,450
do it because

472
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:53,410
the crevices is gonna

473
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,430
it's going to be a little bit tricky

474
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,640
OK so the time

475
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,350
it is or log again

476
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,370
because all i'm doing

477
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,770
is going down the tree

478
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,120
so i only takes time proportional to the height of the tree

479
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,890
OK so that's pretty easy

480
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,560
if i need to list all overlaps

481
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:23,830
was on list of all the overlaps how quickly can i do that

482
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,220
can somebody suggest how i could use this as a subroutine

483
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:35,330
to list all overlaps

484
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:43,850
suppose k overlaps

485
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,120
intervals that overlap my query level and i want to find every single one of

486
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,100
how fast can i do that

487
00:27:54,140 --> 00:28:12,120
how do i do

488
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:26,790
the draw for the phi searches second time i might get the same value

489
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,470
go do what

490
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,220
yeah we find it we

491
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:40,740
o over site find the next one do it or none none left

492
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,830
now if i don't want

493
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,750
if i don't want my love

494
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:51,800
you know i have modified the data structure in sort of all that can

495
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,800
OK cost me OK log n third k overlaps

496
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,510
OK that's actually called an output sensitive algorithm because the

497
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,590
running time of it depends upon how much it outputs

498
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,050
OK so this is output

499
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:10,960
OK so you just

500
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:14,790
complete the best today for this problem by way of listing all

501
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:23,670
is for k plus log in with a different data structure

502
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,500
OK and actually that was open for a while

503
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,760
there's an open problem

504
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:41,590
why is this album always work

505
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:48,960
the key

506
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,670
issue the correctness is

507
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,710
i'm only i'm picking one way to go left to right

508
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,800
as great as long as it's in that subtree

509
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,290
how do i know that when i pick i decided when to go left that

510
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,170
might not be in the right subtree and i went the wrong way

511
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,420
OK if i went right that i accidently left one out on the left side

512
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,510
were always going just one direction

513
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,840
and that sort of the cleverness of the

514
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:22,220
they have the code

515
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,580
the theorem is let's let

516
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,270
l b

517
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,550
the set of intervals i prime

518
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,340
in the left

519
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,600
of the node acts

520
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,200
the set of i i primes

521
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,000
in the right of x

522
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,100
and now the two two-part summer show

523
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,200
the search

524
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,920
goes right

525
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,510
the set high prime

526
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,410
in l

527
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,680
such that i prime overlaps

528
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,170
is the empty set

529
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,370
that's the first thing so that it goes right

530
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,260
and there's nothing in the left subtree

531
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,370
it overlaps

532
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,120
always whenever the code goes right

533
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,420
no problem

534
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:30,620
OK because there was nothing on the left subtree to be found

535
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,800
everybody understand that

536
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,090
OK with that says

537
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,560
to prove this but i will make people understand say because the second one is

538
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,760
can be harder to understand

539
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,540
make sure you understand this one first any questions about this

540
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,880
if the search goes left

541
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:04,060
so i prime in l such that i prime

542
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,000
and this one

543
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,310
and this is the component in the y direction at decouples and that can go

544
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:23,330
so slowly that it can even have a group velocity of zero

545
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,760
when i show you

546
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,460
i can change the size of the gap

547
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,600
what that means in terms of this line

548
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,830
is the following i can lower my frequency

549
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,870
so my frequency will be somewhere here

550
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,050
it is ten to the ten

551
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,280
ten gigahertz

552
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,280
it's all about three centimeters sort of moment that h

553
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,210
becomes less than one point five centimetres that is no longer a way for the

554
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,990
y component to go through

555
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,720
what i'm doing

556
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,180
is to keep this point constant but this line

557
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,350
i am moving slowly up

558
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:07,110
because when i make a smaller it is this point is omega psi goes up

559
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:11,040
and so i make OC omega psi go up until it

560
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,090
it's my

561
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,920
figures like that again and then

562
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,740
right so here in our

563
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,280
in our thinking here we lowered over a guy

564
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:28,000
and i showed you what happens now to do the experiment i lower

565
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,250
and i moved this lineup

566
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,890
delighted that point

567
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,860
OK so i think we're ready for that now

568
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,570
you will be able to hear it i would like someone to witness it could

569
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,930
you come in with it

570
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,820
i wanted to see that the separation between the gap is now two centimetres

571
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,740
the standard on the side here not being you

572
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,780
so looking for the name

573
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,260
chris and the wonderful

574
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,780
my name is well

575
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,530
so this is at two centimetres you see that

576
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,590
this is the transmitter it

577
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,410
is polarized like this

578
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:07,430
here is the receiver which receives the polarized radiation like this

579
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:11,800
we modulated with five hundred and fifty years so you can hear it

580
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:14,180
we cannot here

581
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,450
and to the ten that's not the way

582
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,820
the nature of the science

583
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,640
nor can i a

584
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:25,510
this is five hundred fifty

585
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,840
the gap is two centimetres

586
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,910
i'm going to make it gets more with my hands

587
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:31,840
you watch it when

588
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,530
gets a one and a half centimetres

589
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,490
all of this

590
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,870
this appears

591
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:44,780
that is the consequence of the fact that this point it's you know

592
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,870
this is one and a half centimetres apart

593
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:54,470
i can rotate this ninety degrees

594
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:57,950
and rotate this ninety degrees so that now we have

595
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,370
in vector in this direction

596
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,740
there are no longer any restrictions

597
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:09,680
and the radiation goes because now

598
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,780
i have this red stuff

599
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,410
now i can make it gets smaller

600
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:23,390
and what do you think when i make gets smaller and smaller and smaller

601
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:29,090
very slowly will you nothing because if the gap has no cross-section opening anymore no

602
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,740
radiation can go through

603
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,260
don't expect miracles

604
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,450
if i now make get smaller and smaller and smaller nature has no problem sending

605
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,620
radiation through

606
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,590
nature is that the cross sectional opening

607
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,910
and is of course you make is opening never never never the less and less

608
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,280
and less radiation will go so i will now make it

609
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,570
gets smaller

610
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,120
she is my eyewitness put on top

611
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,470
now about one and a half centimetres

612
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:15,720
make it smaller about one centimeter to go well i want to i seventy seven

613
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,640
about three millimeters

614
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,470
obviously we slowly those

615
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,010
so you see thank you very much for assisting me

616
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,890
my pleasure actually

617
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:31,410
and so you see how bizarre it is that that behaviour

618
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,300
it is so

619
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,030
fundamentally different

620
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,450
for these two

621
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,280
and then the idea of the decoupling

622
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,740
that if you have a few

623
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,890
also late

624
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:48,570
in a direction that has x and y components that the radiation decouples

625
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,820
i think this is a nice moment denies natural moment to have our break

626
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,240
and i was just wondering why the attendance was so high that

627
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,010
then i was reminded of the fact that it's tuesday

628
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,090
so i'm very flattered that you all came

629
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,090
and we will hand them out

630
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,800
and then we will not start yet until the whistle

631
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,910
i will raise all the blackboard so you can see everything

632
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,590
kostunica you help us out

633
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,620
you also help

634
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,410
you also have to make sure that everyone

635
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:31,450
has one

636
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,300
i'm going to change

637
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,280
the situation very dramatically

638
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:51,360
i'm going to give you a closed box

639
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,640
as a conductor

640
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,030
our coordinate system is the same

641
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,870
x y si

642
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,180
and i simply

643
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,240
i call this

644
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,410
eight i call this b

645
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,640
and i call this see that is the length

646
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,260
and that's the coordinate system

647
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,550
and now

648
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,680
comes the question

649
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,990
nine out of electromagnetic radiation in this box

650
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,280
what is going to happen

651
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,410
there is no way that it can get in or out

652
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,490
it's in there

653
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,320
so clearly

654
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,010
are now

655
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,450
get the situation

656
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:38,260
that you have a cavity which very discreet residences

657
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:42,720
the decision boundary looks in the input space will change so if you use

658
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,840
a Gaussian kernel and you make it more and more nonlinear then this decision boundary will

659
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:53,560
also become more and more nonlinear and I can show you  a video of

660
00:38:53,560 --> 00:39:03,800
this I hope so right so here's the Gaussian kernel very broad Gaussian kernel at the beginning

661
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:11,000
almost linear and turning up a non-linearity and grid computing the solution over and over

662
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,520
again and you can see  it becomes more and more nonlinear you know it's almost it's always

663
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:23,780
a hyperplane in the in the reproducing  kernel Hilbert space so at some point I stop this so

664
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:29,200
there's another just a few more examples of such nonlinear

665
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:35,400
surfaces that correspond to hyperplanes in repetition kernel Hilbert space this was from some

666
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:43,020
work that we did in computer graphics some time ago where we constructed methods to

667
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:51,600
represent three D objects as as essentially as hyperplanes in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and these systems

668
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,700
are then trained on surface points so you can download such models in the web

669
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,060
in the form of a surface points and you have millions of surface points for

670
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,880
such objects and then get decision boundaries like this and you can also use it

671
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:09,140
for for objects like that and then think of algorithms to between

672
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:16,920
objects so all these things are essentially hyperplanes in the reproducing Hilbert space so you can represent

673
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,960
complicated things this way and on the next slide I'll show you another example of a nice decision

674
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,080
boundary which some people think it's linear or which becomes linear if you embed it in the right

675
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:42,220
space so okay so we will go back to this one later okay so let's

676
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:48,000
go back to his kernel means so the kernel means algorithm was initially intended just as

677
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,680
a  tutorial logarithm in the first chapter of our book which you  see back there and

678
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:59,260
only later did we notice that is actually interesting in its own right

679
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:03,570
and the interesting thing is so as before I told you well we'll just check whether

680
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,470
the test point is closer to here or to here and I think also told you we

681
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:12,440
will get a decision boundary which is a hyperplane whose normal vector is this vector W

682
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,600
connecting the class means know what I've swept under the rug is what happens

683
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:22,640
if the two class means are identical seems like we're in trouble because the normal

684
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,180
vector would be zero it doesn't define a hyperplane so at that point I

685
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,220
thought maybe that's not interesting but actually it's quite interesting to think about when does

686
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:39,040
it become zero this vector so let's look at this in more detail maybe not in

687
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,440
maybe maybe we'll spend  ten to fifteen minutes on this because it leads to some interesting

688
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:53,700
statistical methods but so so briefly let's get a sorry let's get

689
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,880
an idea for when this happens so when is the mean of the positive class

690
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,420
in the feature space identical to the mean of the negative class now of course

691
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,340
if our feature space  is trivial so if we suppose we start with

692
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:13,920
vector real data and we don't map anywhere we directly work in our input space then this just

693
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,680
means that we have two data sets that have the same mean when also the

694
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:25,340
same first moment statistically speaking now what happens if we use a polynomial kernel for a

695
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:32,040
polynomial kernel it turns out you would remember probably I told you yesterday this kernel

696
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:38,920
implicitly computer mapping into the space spent by all products up to order D so it

697
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,540
turns out if you take two data sets map them into the feature space using this

698
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:48,500
kernel and if you find that in that feature space these two data sets have

699
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:54,080
the same means if you translate it back into what it means in the input space this actually

700
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:59,040
means that all empirical moments of the data sets are up to all the D coincide so that

701
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,640
means for instance for order two  that not just two the data sets have the same

702
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:09,400
average but they also have the same covariance structure or the same variance and co-variance and

703
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,300
if you look as as you increase this order more and more of the higher order  moments

704
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:22,580
of these two distributions  empirical distributions  will be identical so and it turns

705
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:27,300
out if you become sort of more more nonlinear in a certain sensitive if you have a

706
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:33,920
kernel which is strictly positive definite such as a gaussian kernel it turns out that

707
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,920
actually comparing the means in the feature space is the same as comparing the

708
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,120
full structure of the data sets so that if the two means in the

709
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,400
in the feature space are the same then actually the two data sets have to be the

710
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:57,180
same point by point so so roughly speaking this mean remembers each point that contributed to

711
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:03,720
it which is kind of surprising so of course think about it it's a high-dimensional

712
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:09,960
space so the median high-dimensional space in this sense contains more information than directly taking the

713
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:16,000
mean in the input space so let's maybe you find it surprising so let me try

714
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:23,900
to convince you of this last statement because the proof is very short so the

715
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,580
claim is that if the kernel is strictly positive definite if we take two data

716
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:34,660
sets one of them are called X one through X M one Y one through Y N map

717
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:39,520
them into that space compute the means in that space so this is the mean

718
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,760
of the positive data sets I'll use mu it's a shorthand for this mean mapping

719
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,700
this is the mean of the negative data set my claim is that if these two

720
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:55,180
means are the same then all the points X and Y the two sets of points must

721
00:44:55,190 --> 00:45:05,380
be identical and let's prove slightly more general statement statements the following we

722
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:12,740
have two sets of points we assume that each points each set consists of

723
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:18,320
points that are Ys Ys distinct otherwise we get some nontrivial

724
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:23,800
ambiguities and some trivial ambiguities so X is a set of distinct points Y is

725
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:29,390
set of distinct points we're not saying anything about how X and Y are related and

726
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:35,360
it turns out  if we if for some coefficient vectors that are nonzero

727
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,280
if we have a zero we just throw it out we don't have to talk about

728
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:45,640
that so if for some nonzero coefficient vectors we find a kernel expansion in X which equals

729
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:50,760
a kernel expansion in the Ys then the set F X set X must

730
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:55,990
be equal to the set Y so in particular if these over M actually

731
00:45:55,990 --> 00:46:03,340
this is just the mean and likewise here so two means are the same the sets are to be same

732
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:09,000
so let's see I haven't looked at this proof in a while hope I still understand it so so

733
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,100
without loss of so we we're going to prove by contradiction we have to prove

734
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:19,180
that two  sets are the same so let's assume that one of the sets contains an element

735
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,660
OK now let's do one it's a little more interesting what is sufficient statistic for

736
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:27,730
density estimation

737
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,080
which i mean variance or

738
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,770
the median and the mean squared

739
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:39,790
and actually when you look at the point where the gaussians you can see e

740
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,750
that's the

741
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:46,180
the likelihood function is linear

742
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,080
in a vector

743
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:52,500
which includes the mean and the mean square so they let me go back

744
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,140
the more general

745
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,370
case of sufficient statistics here

746
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:57,660
and trying

747
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:04,600
so have a sufficient statistic vector

748
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,290
the function of the data set

749
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:13,390
which delivers to you use something that you can use for maximum likelihood estimation and

750
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:16,230
the way you can think of is that the

751
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:21,450
log the likelihood of the data set under your model is a linear function of

752
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,870
the sufficient statistic factor

753
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:27,480
so let's try to write that down for the gas

754
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,000
and see how

755
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,330
this goes

756
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:37,730
so you can see in case

757
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,390
if you had let's just do the scalar case

758
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,580
you to get points in the log likelihood

759
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:51,450
the probability of the whole data set x

760
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,520
given some

761
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,730
i think that the likelihood function

762
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,040
i would say

763
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,730
and that's just

764
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,810
my one times the sum of all the data points here

765
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:03,410
the my

766
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,140
this is

767
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,480
analysis to expand this

768
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,220
so that gives you access to query

769
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,980
ninety two

770
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:23,080
this is

771
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:28,890
after square and now i'm going to just rewrite this as

772
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:31,040
the british

773
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,160
so x squared far

774
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:40,330
and because i wanted to be the original multiply by and here

775
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:43,930
and this is going to be free

776
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,390
so the average

777
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,730
and this is going to be

778
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:53,370
new square

779
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,230
this is actually the likelihood function

780
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:01,000
and you can see that the likelihood the entire likelihood of the data set just

781
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,980
depends on this vector here which i can write like this

782
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,160
where are

783
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,020
x bar one

784
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,330
that's the sufficient statistic vector and the

785
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,200
it's the likelihood is a linear function of this

786
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,700
which is just one

787
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,460
minus two new

788
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,980
in the one turn

789
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,930
but what we

790
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:32,410
the sufficient statistic is a vector which summarizes your data in a way that's all

791
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:35,600
you need to do you know to do maximum likelihood estimation

792
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:39,120
and this picture which is now

793
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:44,390
o are here is supposed to indicate if you want to take a bayesian approach

794
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:45,810
and think of the

795
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:52,450
parameters as random variables the sufficient statistic was separated from the around the US

796
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,540
and that's

797
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:59,020
o point i think our is going to develop more next week

798
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,750
things that this is

799
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:05,660
you can is not the case for any model

800
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:12,100
it's for any model that has sufficient statistics and the definition of sufficient statistics is

801
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:13,960
a linear function

802
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:23,810
all exponential family models have sufficient statistics and the average natural parameters and roughly speaking

803
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:29,560
only to start here only exponential family models have sufficient statistics

804
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,500
that's not quite true

805
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,560
can someone think of a simple example of model that is in the exponential family

806
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,480
has sufficient statistics

807
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,020
assuming that you know if you something

808
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:43,140
that's right

809
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,500
the uniform distribution

810
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,930
the uniform distribution is not really an exponential family and he

811
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,640
we really want to that

812
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:57,250
but it has easy sufficient statistics if i tell you this quantity x measuring it

813
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:02,180
uniformly distributed and i two hundred measurements x having written on a piece of paper

814
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,930
by an expert jury piece of paper what you need to know

815
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:14,660
about that set of numbers to give me the maximum likelihood uniform distribution

816
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:21,450
or let's write the minimum and the maximum so vector of sufficient statistics vector

817
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,310
it just tells you what you need to know

818
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:28,560
roughly speaking this is true but not

819
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:36,620
that is the

820
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,930
implicit implications here yes

821
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:45,480
that's exponential families a good thing to pursue because learning just involves collecting these factors

822
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,180
have sufficient statistics

823
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:51,040
and of course if you can do the exponential families some extended space then you

824
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,790
can you can have a nonparametric way life which fortunate

825
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:04,750
having just discussed maximum likelihood estimation for sort of ordinary distributions now let's talk about

826
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:09,660
maximum likelihood learning in these graphical models so there you have a graphical model like

827
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,950
this and i give you some observations remember the assumption is that everything is subject

828
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,950
to x one x two x three x four you have a big data table

829
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:23,520
which is formed by and and you want do maximum likelihood estimation in this small

830
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,230
and the back

831
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:30,950
of directed a sickly graphical models when all the nodes are observed

832
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:36,450
this particular symmetry is not present that is where you just have glide reflections

833
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:39,080
and translations and

834
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,640
she was fascinated by that symmetry within one month of going on with this

835
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,490
picture page

836
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,760
and drawing them up in trying to understand them he had made this

837
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,990
test elation

838
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:55,580
so this is his re redoing of polymers

839
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:00,350
picture that i showed you a moment ago

840
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:01,410
he said

841
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:04,040
within one month of going over

842
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:08,560
these pictures by the way you didn't say in this paper how to do it

843
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:11,040
it was just one page of pictures

844
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,970
but it might as well have been the rosetta stone for him

845
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,890
made this

846
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,790
the solution of lizards

847
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:24,830
we have to send symmetry you can see where four legs come together in this

848
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:28,740
world around here have been unable to pull that off

849
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,990
before he read

850
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,950
and so these pictures

851
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:34,760
and here is his very first french

852
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,040
what scares me

853
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,910
i guess i don't have that he made the point of that and in that

854
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:48,770
depicts at the centre of the print those losers he by the way so that

855
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:50,830
predict pull you

856
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:52,700
with a thank you letter

857
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:58,220
i mean you can think of writing a paper on some obscure journals

858
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,870
and thirteen years later you get a thank you letter for a paper

859
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,890
from an artist

860
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:09,240
with a credit saying here's what i made because of your paper

861
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,740
receive that thank you letter and the print some from asher

862
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:28,330
here's another one that should did that matters

863
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:32,580
these particular

864
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:38,040
motifs we have the bat and bird and butterfly and b

865
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:42,350
these have reflection symmetry

866
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:47,600
and if you look at the article text elation you can see very clearly that

867
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:52,890
those lines of reflection symmetry for each of the motifs there's also a line of

868
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,310
reflection symmetry

869
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,060
for the whole

870
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,410
test solution

871
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:59,810
here's another example

872
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:04,270
this is of dragonflies

873
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:05,390
on the right

874
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:07,910
tagging flies and dragonflies

875
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:13,430
this beautiful duality again doing ground nodes each dragonfly

876
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:15,450
has reflection symmetry

877
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,370
and the

878
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:22,240
the lines of reflection symmetry for the print fairly jump out at you are exactly

879
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,310
the same

880
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:29,200
treated motifs with reflection symmetry

881
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,740
in a funny way

882
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:34,600
he treated as an exception

883
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,180
if the motif have reflection symmetry it was very stiff

884
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:43,040
and he wanted swelling and flying and swimming motifs

885
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,410
and so

886
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:50,180
whenever he had a motif that have reflection symmetry he put a little story can

887
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:54,270
see here because it's off the screen will start at the bottom of his picture

888
00:55:54,680 --> 00:56:01,240
and set up at least since symmetric and in every case we're on his symmetric

889
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:06,660
motif was arranged so that the line of symmetry of the motif was in fact

890
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:10,080
in line of symmetry of the whole plant

891
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,270
but there is one exception

892
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:14,160
and that

893
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,100
that's this one

894
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:21,660
at the bottom

895
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:28,430
asher says apparently symmetric motifs and it's true isn't quite symmetric if you

896
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:31,290
strong line right down the middle

897
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:33,310
this bird

898
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:37,770
the left wing is just a little bit wider than the right wing it's not

899
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:41,500
quite perfect mirror symmetry but it's darn close

900
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:45,770
and looking at this plant program but was very

901
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:49,950
interested to see can i make that so that i can make a perfect

902
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:53,840
action sequences executed in the initial state

903
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:55,850
the a

904
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:58,340
after the

905
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:05,660
technology all access will be girls

906
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:09,490
any questions about that

907
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,750
now i'm going to proceed with

908
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:21,700
sort of practical approach to landing

909
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:28,670
displayed based on solving the satisfiability problem will the less true logic

910
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:30,430
the idea here

911
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:32,520
is that

912
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,120
so we have

913
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,640
problem instance

914
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,120
like this here

915
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:42,040
this from the looks something else

916
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,770
then we have

917
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:48,340
planning are he

918
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,960
and the producer proposed formula

919
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,760
that is satisfiable

920
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:57,930
is plan

921
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,880
of link e

922
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,760
so this whole sequence of actions

923
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,110
the actions

924
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,230
that takes us from the initial state

925
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:09,370
one of the goals

926
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:16,270
this turned out to be when this was invented fifteen years ago

927
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,240
what is more selling planning problems

928
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:22,480
two reasons so

929
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:25,920
people have been considering

930
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,860
planning rules so there's no parameter p

931
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:34,510
then you have a couple of environment on the planet

932
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:38,370
you very strong constraints put those plans like

933
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,210
this allows the use of

934
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:47,710
if you methods as implemented in the current best SAT solvers

935
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:50,040
actually find the so when

936
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:52,790
the this for plan and you

937
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:57,680
even land upon but that's also what close to the actual planning

938
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:03,160
you can even things that must hold you in the plan execution by

939
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:11,080
the vessels like unit resolution rule and this list in indicates what black

940
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:15,840
how this thing works will be explained in the next slide

941
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,160
so the

942
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:19,510
the basic idea is to

943
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,680
propositional formula

944
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:30,190
that expresses what that action actually does

945
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:35,820
the idea is that we have a formula

946
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:39,370
sorry for variable for every state variable

947
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:41,490
for every state variable

948
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:44,750
value in the current state and then we have

949
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,260
propose to formalise

950
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:50,030
for every state variable value in the sectors

951
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,340
so that's why

952
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,670
if i was the variables a b c and so on

953
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,890
the median

954
00:59:56,890 --> 01:00:00,960
two sets of frozen variables first that tells us what are the values of the

955
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,670
same person current state

956
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:06,940
and the prime the variance of these frozen variables tells us what are the values

957
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,380
of state variables in sixties

958
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,360
here is the

959
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,840
i think it's the same what world actually considered earlier

960
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,610
the precondition has all the

961
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:23,910
current state so this is simply the precondition prose form of had

962
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,810
in the

963
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:28,210
the point of action is shorter

964
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:30,940
and the effects

965
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:32,440
i have to be true

966
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,020
the successor states

967
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,430
so here we have

968
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:36,870
in britain the ball

969
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,850
every aspect of their actions

970
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,890
with the prime there

971
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:44,480
well say that in the second stage

972
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,430
this act must be

973
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,860
these things many people would normalising OK that's enough

974
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:58,670
you have to say that the people as the called and it must be true

975
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:02,120
the success but this is not enough because

976
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:05,180
we only have those first lines there

977
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:07,630
then we still allow

978
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:14,580
anything happens to all the remaining state schools and that's not what this actually about

979
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,540
because this action

980
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:21,120
formula here all souls has to say that you need

981
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,330
state variable

982
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,520
that is not affected by this action

983
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:28,240
has to retain its values

984
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:32,990
and this is what is what has been expressed by these equalities so for every

985
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:36,980
that area is not affected by the

986
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:45,950
has the same value in the current state and

987
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:49,820
state of

988
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,710
well from the third line on would be a b

989
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:56,580
more complicated

990
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,470
could be made complicated

991
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:04,790
he had a conditional effects because in some cases the variable changes its value and

992
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,950
some other it's not so

993
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,880
the the

994
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,960
formal definition of it will be slightly above in the simple case

995
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,850
no the effects on conditions

996
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:22,140
then it looks like this

997
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:26,210
general description of

998
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:28,600
the axis of

999
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:36,370
we have to consider every possible state variables

1000
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:41,890
and all the possible effects that could have taken that so nothing happens

1001
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:45,580
state variables me through the steps made false

1002
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,810
the state variable is conditionally made through

1003
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:51,350
the state variables conditional it falls

1004
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:53,730
and the state variable is made up

1005
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:57,640
true or false conditionally but was one of

1006
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,310
case this difference

1007
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:05,560
well i describe what happens that they were actually so

1008
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:11,440
nothing happened is that there will be a vehicle is a is equivalent great prime

1009
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,540
i'm going to fix all simple simply the

1010
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,370
correspondingly there are

1011
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:21,270
b prime there to signify it's the successor states

1012
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:24,350
this one is of

1013
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:27,730
making a true conditionally

1014
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,350
each rule

1015
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:30,730
if and only if

1016
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:32,480
was through already

1017
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:37,660
or the conditional the conditional is true in the cars

1018
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:39,810
since same thing for the

1019
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,390
conditional i think when

1020
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:44,190
it could be false

1021
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,930
it will be true if and only if

1022
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:49,960
it was two already

1023
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:56,410
and we have found the mean that i attacked by dynamics

1024
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,120
and also many

1025
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,190
you can see that is

1026
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:04,860
so that

1027
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:08,400
i direct link be

1028
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,520
the our what got

1029
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,120
OK so i think of

1030
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:14,270
probability distribution

1031
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,860
it means

1032
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,150
some mission

1033
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:25,680
but in some cases we are taking about not

1034
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,040
taking just

1035
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:32,480
that the point keep

1036
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,100
so already

1037
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:40,980
why and how can we talk about making

1038
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,780
one tenth and so on

1039
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,850
and we director

1040
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:49,050
introduce divergence

1041
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:55,080
maybe a bit too far

1042
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:57,520
OK so

1043
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:03,400
and i

1044
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,410
good for

1045
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,930
we have a convex functions

1046
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:13,800
and for convex function of course if have a brain and

1047
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:16,710
so the brain and i about

1048
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:19,060
he's the one who expressed

1049
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,910
so i mean

1050
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:24,710
and now

1051
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:27,570
what in the space of four b

1052
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:33,390
maybe four

1053
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:37,360
we know the cause of

1054
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:38,590
nineteen the

1055
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,370
if the diver

1056
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:43,950
proposed by enriching

1057
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:45,860
and the

1058
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,940
come from the hunting convex function

1059
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:51,150
and to bring on

1060
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,380
and we know

1061
01:05:53,400 --> 01:06:02,080
he died young was also a member of f divergence and of course they come

1062
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,890
the only unique died

1063
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,780
put the ball square

1064
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,760
we do to extend

1065
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,210
i linked

1066
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:18,840
saying that she is not the case

1067
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,550
but our that

1068
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,720
so what it if diver

1069
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:35,710
so this is for the case and if it diverges

1070
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,410
defined by this equation it

1071
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,410
is convex set

1072
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,820
that's fine

1073
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,810
we modify

1074
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:57,680
by using something the day about

1075
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:00,040
twenty five

1076
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:05,040
if i or but according to media

1077
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,700
three major input p two

1078
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,680
combination of the two that i not

1079
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:13,570
thank you

1080
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:17,850
surely we can define the divergence

1081
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:24,620
how to find if i don't

1082
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,410
if i'm line the

1083
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:36,150
then in the next day that property here

1084
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,810
on the about

1085
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:44,750
convex function if we use these functions and we have the

1086
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:51,900
i do we can diverse in this position he what the

1087
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:53,470
it can be beaten

1088
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,080
this one

1089
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,530
and is this one

1090
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:00,640
great brown and the field

1091
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:03,310
probably this is a

1092
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:07,940
i some p and the summit and q is equal

1093
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:11,410
so just

1094
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,340
but for media

1095
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,980
we should have

1096
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:18,170
no it's actually

1097
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:21,170
the british public

1098
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:30,860
OK i about the variance

1099
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,420
and i

1100
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:34,090
it is invariant

1101
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:35,390
i mean

1102
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:39,620
i mean this discrete his what the that OK

1103
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:42,840
the probability that you to make

1104
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,630
the city two

1105
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:50,710
i just

1106
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,210
eight clustering

1107
01:08:57,310 --> 01:09:00,580
well we have cost greedy

1108
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:02,330
and i just

1109
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,850
each group

1110
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:13,600
probability of p and q e proportion

1111
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,760
we cannot in general be

1112
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:21,350
so let's type

1113
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:25,350
we cannot distinguish panicking because it wasn't

1114
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:30,350
in the case the court in court

1115
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,630
you can see e

1116
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:38,290
if guy but he

1117
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:40,480
one that had

1118
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:43,110
also they are

1119
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,570
the image

1120
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:46,290
among diagram

1121
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:51,930
does not useful

1122
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:54,590
OK to greenland here

1123
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:59,640
and in the case of bregman divergence we're taking gradient

1124
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:02,760
we have to go and

1125
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:06,020
and that can be defined in this way

1126
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:08,830
i mean i'm sure you're right

1127
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,930
now we write in this

1128
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:17,870
and i was right

1129
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,360
right all the strong force with the cause there

1130
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:29,080
at first looks very non unnatural

1131
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,290
but the fact is that

1132
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:33,310
what we

1133
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,180
do when we do these

1134
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:59,520
is we she right from the bottom and top

1135
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:02,810
we look at what we want and then we construct

1136
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,320
the proof from that

1137
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,460
we do the math

1138
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,880
that's why he writes that we can get this from

1139
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,630
three readers getting

1140
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:18,100
i understand that but this is sort of in the proof this

1141
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,090
but what we have

1142
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:22,580
we get that from that

1143
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:25,750
let's call letters

1144
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:41,850
we can have versions putting zero on the right hand of the structure

1145
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:47,860
two which is all the right pushing right part one often use those directly

1146
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:54,770
anything here so i i didn't write them down but

1147
01:11:54,860 --> 01:12:00,030
the is that we get this thing we can put it in where we needed

1148
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:04,780
say the things the theorem which is what we need

1149
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,160
extremely you all

1150
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,690
the rules these left push and pop rules

1151
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,880
some of the stress the trolls normal

1152
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:22,110
looking ones

1153
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,960
some of the

1154
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:38,540
if you want to logic

1155
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:39,440
the thing

1156
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,110
you know you

1157
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:48,880
the stricter qualification and how all men can take the direct actions were directed at

1158
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:54,090
think it

1159
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:58,600
thirty years of

1160
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,410
the these things are going i mean a lot to these names they have to

1161
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:17,370
combinatory logic which i don't think one lecture on right now

1162
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:19,040
are just

1163
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:29,890
well used as names

1164
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:33,030
because people are injured by their names

1165
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:36,860
by those letters it's just easier

1166
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:49,540
tivities something we

1167
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,880
premises is something you probably

1168
01:13:53,910 --> 01:14:00,360
just would not something in some for all logical systems and we can see

1169
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:05,710
in this lecture we talk about about

1170
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:11,750
well we talk about lambda calculus briefly

1171
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:14,370
associativity really make sense

1172
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,900
in that context

1173
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:54,850
persian associativity it which is you at some different results

1174
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:22,850
and this is a strong commutativity

1175
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:34,840
john's wort system a lot of system calls are handled consistent called

1176
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:38,050
and c for strong commutativity

1177
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:40,860
at hand

1178
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:43,010
these as well

1179
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:56,400
now that might be more we're going to talk about some commuting

1180
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:59,420
i mean to take a

1181
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:39,270
well hated by australian are relevant logicians

1182
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,390
and it's something that stands in the way

1183
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:52,110
this decidability proofs and a lot of other things on the next lecture

1184
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,140
it's been blamed for

1185
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:57,450
it's called currys paradox

1186
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,680
OK and

1187
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:06,370
last from all talk was k

1188
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,320
what do these things

1189
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:18,100
faced me in the equation and I had to have something to replace them with

1190
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:26,580
now using this already in calculus of this this distinction of that might have been

1191
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:31,270
a year and a half ago but just let me remind you of typically in

1192
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:35,580
calculus for example when you want to do this kind of integral what's a x

1193
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:40,250
times the square root of one minus X squared DX

1194
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:43,410
the substitution you would use for that is you

1195
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:45,960
equals one minus X squared

1196
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:51,450
right and then you calculate and then you observe that this next EX more like

1197
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:57,220
snakes of DU apart from a constant factor so this would be an example of

1198
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:59,750
direct substitution

1199
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:03,840
you put it in and convert the integral into an integral and you what would

1200
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:08,580
be an example of inverse substitution will I take away the x

1201
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:12,420
and ask you instead to do this integral

1202
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:16,100
and you know that the right thing to do is not to start with you

1203
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:21,890
but to start with the exon right x equals sign cosine you

1204
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:26,420
so this is the direct substitution in that integral but this integral calls for an

1205
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:30,870
inverse substitution in order to be able to do it and notice that will practically

1206
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:34,680
the same but of course as you know from your experience not

1207
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:35,540
the very different

1208
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:44,040
so I'm going to watch for that distinction as I do all these examples the

1209
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:50,150
first one I want to do is an example of a direct substitution

1210
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:53,010
In fact

1211
01:18:53,680 --> 01:19:03,950
but but but but but but but but but but

1212
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:11,700
so applies to an equation of the form Y prime equals

1213
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:17,990
to turn kinds of terms on the right hand side a of x some what

1214
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:20,430
was used P of X

1215
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:25,230
you X times Y

1216
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:34,290
Q of X times any power whatsoever of walleye will notice for example if anymore

1217
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:39,010
what kind of equation with this the wider the end would be what

1218
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:44,250
and this would be a linear equation which you know itself and so on

1219
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,940
equals 0 we already know how to do so let's assume that is not 0

1220
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,080
so there were new territory

1221
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:56,650
well what if any are equal to 1 you can separate variables so that 2

1222
01:19:56,650 --> 01:20:01,560
is not exciting but nonetheless it will be included what I'm going to say now

1223
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:08,720
if that is 2 or 3 were men could be one half so any anything

1224
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:16,220
even 0 is alright is just silly at any number

1225
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:20,560
could be negative n equals minus flight that would be fine also

1226
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:25,390
all this kind of equation to get its name is called Bernoulli's equation

1227
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:31,170
after named after which Bernoulli I have not the faintest idea they were fighting 3

1228
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:35,180
or 4 of them and they fought with each other but they're smart

1229
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:41,850
the key trick you like

1230
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:48,430
to solving any Bernoulli equation 11 called 1 of thing collect the most important is

1231
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:49,930
what's missing

1232
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:55,550
it must not have a pure exterminated if I in and that goes for constant

1233
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:59,530
term needed in other words it must look exactly like this

1234
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:05,460
everything multiplied by Y were power 2 terms so for example if I add 1

1235
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:06,510
to this

1236
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:12,790
the equation becomes not doable

1237
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:19,110
it's very easy to contaminated into an equation that unsolvable it's gonna look just like

1238
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:24,870
now you got 1 on your homework so you got several Pol Pot 1 part

1239
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:30,610
to have really equations on themselves you know this this is practical but in some

1240
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:39,750
sense when we got the idea is to divide by dividing by a wide end

1241
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:47,670
ignore all formulas that you're given just remember that when you see something that looks

1242
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:48,270
like this

1243
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:52,430
or something that you can turn it into something that looks like this divide through

1244
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:58,530
by 1 and power no matter what energy alright so why prime over why the

1245
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:00,430
end is equal to

1246
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,690
the effects times

1247
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:08,880
1 over 1 to the n minus 1 right

1248
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,040
what you have access

1249
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:16,230
and from these examples you know you didn't have this concept before but now you

1250
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:18,470
have that we can check this by

1251
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:23,030
testing your generalisation performance in machine learning the lingo you would say here's the training

1252
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:26,850
set i give you three examples and now the rest of this is the test

1253
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:31,300
it's kind of transduction problem if you know that the term so let's go through

1254
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:34,550
some test examples

1255
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,770
yes yes in two for now

1256
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:51,990
a little more uncertainty there which is fine

1257
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,280
but you know

1258
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:57,730
we're bayesian our model predicts that just fine as you'll see

1259
01:22:57,770 --> 01:23:00,350
OK so that's the idea that somehow

1260
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,870
you've got this right i mean i guess you we don't know what the ground

1261
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:05,940
truth is but trust me your right

1262
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:10,430
right so this is one kind of problem that we study but common misunderstanding this

1263
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:13,480
sort of problem all over the place i mean just in perception we perceive the

1264
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:17,190
three d world from a two d image that has a certain kind of we

1265
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:19,310
on the data

1266
01:23:19,340 --> 01:23:23,040
a lot of the interest in our group and cognitive science more generally is in

1267
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:27,180
large scale systems of knowledge what are sometimes called intuitive theories but some machine learning

1268
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:31,530
is usually focused on learning a little bit of knowledge like learning a single concept

1269
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:34,460
or single function but our knowledge of the world

1270
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,480
you can think of it as having many of these bits but they are integrated

1271
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:41,120
into some larger system it's larger than the more than the sum of the sum

1272
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:45,580
of the parts so we have intuitive theories of physics or intuitive theories of psychology

1273
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:49,020
that underlie our common sense in the world right here i am standing up here

1274
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:52,510
my ability to not fall off the stage my ability to to make sure my

1275
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:58,210
laptop doesn't fall and suffer catastrophic failure hitting the ground all these things is guided

1276
01:23:58,210 --> 01:24:01,500
by an implicit intuitive theory of of how physical

1277
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:05,610
objects in dynamics and you can see evidence that even very young children like infants

1278
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:10,400
who can even speak or walk have these kinds of intuitive theories about how objects

1279
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:15,750
work or an intuitive psychology we if you've heard of theory of mind that's the

1280
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,450
kind of intuitive psychology where we see people

1281
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:21,830
acting in the world even just moving around and when you see somebody moving you

1282
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:24,900
don't just see them as object in motion but you see them as an entity

1283
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,400
governed by these

1284
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:31,390
very interesting latent variables mental states like beliefs and desires you see somebody had at

1285
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:34,000
that if somebody wanted is got up in the middle of this lecture and ran

1286
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,820
out the door i wouldn't be wouldn't just BMT my motion area processing that would

1287
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:46,010
be thinking what's wrong with that forget something about what i say that intuitive psychology

1288
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:50,910
we interpret and and and make predictions about other people's behavior by inferring these latent

1289
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:54,090
variables and time permitting at at the end of

1290
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:59,750
the next lecture on all talk about how we can take ideas from probabilistic inference

1291
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:02,980
in machine learning all the way up to those kinds of systems of knowledge

1292
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:06,850
so our our goal is to try to reverse engineer these

1293
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:10,770
these pieces of cognition and how they get there however learning works and then also

1294
01:25:10,770 --> 01:25:13,870
to try to build more human like machine learning algorithms and i'll go back and

1295
01:25:13,870 --> 01:25:18,120
forth between those two problems this isn't just to say that you know any ideal

1296
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:21,730
computational model we come up with necessarily describes how the how the mind works but

1297
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:25,840
i think it's pretty clear that human learning is is the gold standard machine learning

1298
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:26,750
should be

1299
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:30,720
aspiring to to match these for these kinds of problems

1300
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:32,930
now this

1301
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:38,970
these problems are not actually original two psychologists or machine learning people but they have

1302
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:42,610
a history in the western philosophical tradition under the name of the problem of induction

1303
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:46,150
so as long as people at least in the western tradition have been thinking about

1304
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:50,120
thinking they've been thinking about these problems and talking about play-doh aristotle

1305
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:57,030
the whole modern european philosophical tradition and as long as people have been thinking about

1306
01:25:57,030 --> 01:26:01,500
how you generalize beyond the data that's given they have the same kind of answer

1307
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:05,800
just basically they're just different variants on it if you're making leaps to go beyond

1308
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,260
a small number of data points which are going to be on the data that's

1309
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:12,680
in there this country be some other bits that make up the gap some other

1310
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:16,650
kind of knowledge is usually something more abstract that you can bring to bear on

1311
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:21,340
this particular situation and in bayesian full call these priors

1312
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:22,260
people in

1313
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:26,900
in general machine learning to people talk about inductive bias

1314
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:27,890
the people

1315
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:37,560
to to and which is the best people

1316
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:45,680
no 1 was available to take advantage of the weather on Saturday now

1317
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:54,180
it was good weather on Saturday in theory and the we have and number 2

1318
01:26:54,190 --> 01:26:59,690
uh 1 7 and everybody is downloaded the notes for today right or who is

1319
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:04,740
not downloaded the notes for today's class OK so 0

1320
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:08,800
supposed to download the notes of

1321
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:10,370
don't have extra copies

1322
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:15,370
but maybe you can look on with someone sitting nearby

1323
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:26,020
but when it comes to certain things will be doing that

1324
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:33,640
and anybody have an equal in some particular matters

1325
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:39,510
yes I want and right OK so

1326
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:48,440
was still in group as the TA and he should be here momentarily what he

1327
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:54,500
gives he's running from class across campus so there's 1 other person who situation I

1328
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,300
think is like yours

1329
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:09,560
oversee so who here cannot make either office hours or recitation

1330
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:15,250
OK the 0 3 people OK so what I'm going to ask you to do

1331
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:21,450
is to meet with me Andrew F. 2 class today and come up with the

1332
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:25,650
time knows he symmetry wants to do what we talked about as a possible solution

1333
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:28,900
is just stay to schedule another

1334
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:36,410
office hours segment on friday OK and he will discuss various options with you but

1335
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:40,050
it would but if this if we do this through e-mail will get resolved by

1336
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:42,130
August so 0

1337
01:28:43,510 --> 01:28:48,870
you should 3 we should stay after class and talk it over with Andrew who

1338
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:50,810
should be here

1339
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:56,770
should be here in theory that OK the rest of the world

1340
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,000
but I wouldn't say that but in your case it will be so that the

1341
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:06,600
words that that that that the bottom line is there's no recitation time that everybody

1342
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:12,180
can make that is not horribly inconvenient if we had recitation friday 7 AM everybody

1343
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:20,080
can make it and there and no 1 wants that so but of his that

1344
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:26,820
I don't actually know historically how much recitation has proven useful to people so but

1345
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:30,380
my sense is you could probably compass the same thing in office and that's the

1346
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:36,880
idea that the officers probably good substitute for 1 or maybe even better so OK

1347
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:42,620
and and then you have homework due today so just make sure you drop it

1348
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:46,460
off when you walk out of the classroom you don't need to

1349
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:51,040
you need to turn it into right now and also today you probably wondering why

1350
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:59,880
I'm wired for uh and being filmed this is part of MIT is a listeriosis

1351
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:07,340
OpenCourseWare projects so how many of you not familiar with Open Courseware so you you

1352
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:13,440
don't know what it is where you where you at MIT all on their own

1353
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:19,000
OK so Bristol you could lose your registration status just for not knowing what open

1354
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,460
to the course

1355
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:26,240
Open Courseware is MIT is big thing where instead of trying to make money by

1356
01:30:27,810 --> 01:30:34,250
selling distance editor whatever at MIT has decided that

1357
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:41,610
perfect verb and I hope to get like over 90 % faculty participation eventually just

1358
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:47,450
1 on faculty just posters materials in a well-designed way

1359
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:52,170
with official institutes support so that anybody in the world and see what's going on

1360
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:53,010
in the course

1361
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:59,450
answers said that is not say you get an MIT education but you can see

1362
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:01,850
what we do so

1363
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:05,170
people consider material here and then they're they're gonna be I think there could be

1364
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:13,540
filming 3 lectures here just to illustrate the how professor reacts to brilliant students so

1365
01:31:13,690 --> 01:31:16,950
In with that in

1366
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:22,640
with that in mind let's start today's lecture so Mr.

1367
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:26,310
In OK so

1368
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:32,620
thank you so this homework assignment should be due next Tuesday this class I you

1369
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:37,960
disappointed is not going to meet next Tuesday because in my next Tuesday and Monday

1370
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:43,240
class the right that's the way it so it works to parity in the schedule

1371
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:48,520
between Monday Wednesday classes Tuesday Thursday classes so we need this Tuesday and Thursday and

1372
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:53,320
we don't meet again until next Thursday so next summer we do instead of next

1373
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:59,780
tuesday next Thursday the 19th OK and what I want you to do is exercises

1374
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:07,140
3 7 from the handout on Newton's method and exercises 1 to 14 17 18

1375
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:11,610
it is expensive ok and it is some of them doesn't in the sense

1376
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:14,670
that you can point and say you know this is my function

1377
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:17,690
k nine have a whole space of possible functions and you can draw

1378
01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:20,940
from that space at the same time can easily quantify

1379
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:24,690
how uncertain you are and the other interesting thing about this

1380
01:32:24,690 --> 01:32:30,090
picture is that if we see where the uncertainty is high that indicates

1381
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:32,480
perhaps where we should collect more data

1382
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:37,130
ok now that's not setting that's often talked about in sort

1383
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:41,230
of standard supervised learning it's sort of active learning setting

1384
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:43,670
where if we know where uncertainty is

1385
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:47,430
we can actually make a question and ask okay we want an example in

1386
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:49,660
this area what's the label of that example

1387
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:52,830
and that can drive the learning there's a very interesting sort of

1388
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:55,940
research question of how to do that well on fish

1389
01:32:57,580 --> 01:33:01,230
this is just a picture of continuing this sort of drawing points

1390
01:33:01,230 --> 01:33:03,950
and you can see that as you drawn more and more points

1391
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:06,410
you still have multiple hypotheses in the sort of a patient

1392
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:08,530
view because you have a distribution over hypotheses but

1393
01:33:08,530 --> 01:33:11,700
they all sort of clustered together in order to fit the data

1394
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:15,650
in the limit as you have an infinite amount of data the optimization

1395
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:17,660
becomes the same as maximum likelihood

1396
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,640
but when you have a small amount of data the prior has say

1397
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:26,930
ok and so the the hypothesis that you get are driven by both the

1398
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,330
prior and the data

1399
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:36,850
ok so so base in the bayes in these kind of interesting because

1400
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:40,070
it tells us about what are our assumptions that gives us the uncertainty

1401
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:42,520
estimates it can guide active learning

1402
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:50,830
it is tricky ok in the sense that if you for example overwhelm

1403
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:54,220
your prior with data quickly that prob prior doesn't really help

1404
01:33:54,230 --> 01:33:56,520
you it's also tricky because it is

1405
01:33:57,050 --> 01:34:00,280
sort of expensive to work with this sort of sample hypotheses

1406
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:06,500
but but it can be actually quite interesting are there any questions

1407
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:14,930
or comments about the ok ok ok

1408
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:24,780
so now the last thing i want to to to mention to you

1409
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:29,140
is logistic regression y well because it's sort of the equivalent

1410
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:31,940
of linear regression for classification problems and goes

1411
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:34,850
going to tell you all about how to do this a lot better

1412
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,610
but this is kind of usual statistical view of things

1413
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:45,980
so here we have a hypothesis ok and the hypothesis is a logistic

1414
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:49,380
function this linear combination of the inputs so that

1415
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:52,160
is the input w to suppose x is a linear combination

1416
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:56,290
and then we do this and you get this sort of shape

1417
01:34:56,510 --> 01:35:02,150
ok the function that those and the like this you'll see

1418
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:06,200
lot more about this later is also called sigmoid neuron in the

1419
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,310
neural net literature

1420
01:35:09,940 --> 01:35:15,200
so why is this close to linear ok we're going to interpret the output

1421
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:18,920
of this hypothesis as the probability of the class label being

1422
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:24,130
one given the input ok and so if that's our interpretation and

1423
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:27,930
if we look at the log-odds ratio of the probability of the two

1424
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:31,550
classes binary classification case y equal to one and like for

1425
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:35,130
to zero you get the weights times the inputs

1426
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:39,180
ok so that's linear ok and that's the sense which we have things

1427
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:41,400
that learning and

1428
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:46,700
the interesting thing is that if we find the best weights here

1429
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:50,620
ok the best weights are going to maximize the conditional likelihood

1430
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:54,240
of the outputs given the inputs ok so that's kind of nice

1431
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:57,630
it's again a maximum likelihood criterion and it's sort of us sort

1432
01:35:57,630 --> 01:35:59,560
of standard discriminative setting

1433
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:06,260
ok so now what are we going to optimize well we can optimize

1434
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:12,260
the cross-entropy ok so how do we think about the cross-entropy

1435
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:16,970
we have some distribution i have observed outputs in the data

1436
01:36:16,970 --> 01:36:19,420
and then we have some distribution as generated by the

1437
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:23,910
output of our hypothesis ok we're going to measure how far off

1438
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:29,070
one is from the other ok so the log-likelihood of the hypothesis

1439
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:33,190
of course you

1440
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:38,780
and each vertex for each vertex

1441
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:44,840
in two

1442
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:47,780
with the weight

1443
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:54,840
one of the least weight edge

1444
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:08,650
do a vertex

1445
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:18,260
so here's the code

1446
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:20,240
to restore out

1447
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,690
with q

1448
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:25,630
being all vertices

1449
01:37:25,630 --> 01:37:27,920
you start out with

1450
01:37:28,110 --> 01:37:32,280
with a being if you will the empty set

1451
01:37:33,670 --> 01:37:37,150
and what going do is the least weight edge therefore four

1452
01:37:37,170 --> 01:37:39,440
for everything in

1453
01:37:39,490 --> 01:37:42,090
in the priority queue

1454
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:43,780
it's is basically going to be

1455
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:49,010
because none of them have any

1456
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:51,150
it is the least weight edge

1457
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:53,860
to the empty set is going to be empty

1458
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:56,880
i'm going to start out with one guy

1459
01:37:56,990 --> 01:37:59,880
o colin as

1460
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:02,820
which was set to zero

1461
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:07,320
for some arbitrary

1462
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:09,360
as in fig

1463
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:11,420
and the main part of the algorithm

1464
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,340
kicks in

1465
01:38:13,490 --> 01:38:17,030
that certain initialisation

1466
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:23,760
and when when we do the analysis someone write some stuff on the left-hand side

1467
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,570
of the board so if you're taking notes you may want to also leave little

1468
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:30,590
bit is based on the left-hand side you notes

1469
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:34,860
so while

1470
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,740
is not empty

1471
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:47,530
we get the smallest element

1472
01:38:56,420 --> 01:39:07,570
and then we some stuff

1473
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:51,130
and the only thing i should mention here is OK i'm just going on here

1474
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:53,230
and then we run on the

1475
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:54,940
on example

1476
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,210
OK so what we do is we

1477
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:00,630
take out the smallest element out of the queue at each step

1478
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:04,590
and then for everything in the adjacency list of everything for which i have an

1479
01:40:05,530 --> 01:40:06,960
going to

1480
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,400
from b to

1481
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:09,280
to you

1482
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:10,760
we take a look

1483
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,210
and if

1484
01:40:12,230 --> 01:40:14,630
the is still in

1485
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:16,800
in our set

1486
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:22,230
the minus a so things we've taken out are going to be part of it

1487
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:26,260
OK every time we take something out this continue that we construct

1488
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:30,820
four at every step we want to find what's the cheapest edge connecting that a

1489
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:33,860
and everything else we basically are going to take

1490
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:36,880
whatever that cheapest thing is

1491
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:43,340
OK that you and now bring that into a find the next cheapest one

1492
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:46,130
and we just keep repeating that process

1493
01:40:46,150 --> 01:40:47,970
OK well will do it on the example

1494
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:51,090
the what we do is every time we bring it and

1495
01:40:51,090 --> 01:40:53,260
i keep track of what was the

1496
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,860
vertex responsible

1497
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:03,230
for bringing me and and what i claim is that at the end

1498
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:06,300
if i look at

1499
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,380
the set of these pairs that i've

1500
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,800
made here the

1501
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:12,400
and higher v

1502
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:21,570
four is the minimum spanning tree

1503
01:41:21,570 --> 01:41:23,030
let's just do this

1504
01:41:23,090 --> 01:41:33,260
what that we're all set so let's get rid of

1505
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:39,900
let's get rid of these guys here because we're we compute the

1506
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:41,460
from scratch

1507
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:47,550
OK so you may want

1508
01:41:47,610 --> 01:41:51,070
copy new things over in here

1509
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:55,030
we cut the graph over again your text was is going to do it but

1510
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:57,530
it turned out this is exactly the board

1511
01:41:57,570 --> 01:42:01,210
gary society OK just

1512
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:02,630
well OK

1513
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:05,590
so we we start out make everything the infinity

1514
01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:15,490
OK so that's where my keep the

1515
01:42:15,510 --> 01:42:18,650
the key value

1516
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:24,090
and then what i'm going to do

1517
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:32,360
he is fine one vertex error call him as that

1518
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:36,610
i mean this vertex here call that as so basically and now make him be

1519
01:42:38,670 --> 01:42:47,160
now what i do is i execute extract men

1520
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:52,000
so basically what i do is alter shape him like this

1521
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:56,460
he has now

1522
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:59,370
the join set a

1523
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:00,870
so a is going to be

1524
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,830
this is going to be a

1525
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:05,790
and this

1526
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:08,110
elements of the mindset

1527
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:17,110
so then what we do is we take a look

1528
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:19,410
at r

1529
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:22,130
we extract him

1530
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:23,860
and then for each

1531
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:28,240
imagine the adjacency list OK so that for each vertex in distance so this that

1532
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:30,130
these guys here

1533
01:43:31,190 --> 01:43:34,700
we're going to look to see if it still in q that is in b

1534
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:37,320
minor say

1535
01:43:37,330 --> 01:43:38,550
and if so

1536
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:40,050
we're going to do

1537
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:41,790
and the and its

1538
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:46,410
t value is less than what the value is the edge there when replaced by

1539
01:43:46,410 --> 01:43:47,940
the edge value

1540
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:50,740
so in this case we replace this by seven

1541
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:52,940
we replace this by fifteen

1542
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:58,260
replace this phi ten

1543
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:02,360
because we we're interested in is what is the cheapest

1544
01:44:02,370 --> 01:44:05,050
now notice that everything in

1545
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:06,820
the minus a

1546
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:10,400
that's what's in the priority queue everything in there

1547
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:12,570
OK now has its

1548
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:15,730
it's cheapest way of connecting it

1549
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:20,300
to the things that i've already removed the things that are in a

1550
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,080
so now i just

1551
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:27,470
OK when i actually do that update

1552
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:31,630
there's actually something implicit going on in the priority queue

1553
01:44:31,650 --> 01:44:34,650
and that is that i have to do a decrease KEY

1554
01:44:34,660 --> 01:44:36,540
there's an implicit

1555
01:44:37,300 --> 01:44:40,590
decrease of the key

1556
01:44:40,620 --> 01:44:46,240
so increased he is trying to operation lowers the value

1557
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:48,590
the key in the priority queue

1558
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:54,340
so that's implicitly going on when i look at what data structure many used to

1559
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:56,830
implement their priority queue

1560
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:01,920
OK so common data structures for implementing priority queue are

1561
01:45:01,970 --> 01:45:04,030
he i mean he

1562
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:06,940
OK so i have to make sure that i'm actually

1563
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:11,190
doing this operation i can't just change it not affect my he so there's no

1564
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:13,920
implicit operation going on

1565
01:45:13,950 --> 01:45:15,750
OK now i repeat

1566
01:45:15,790 --> 01:45:17,630
i find the cheapest

1567
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:20,610
o thing all and i also have to set now

1568
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:22,620
the pointer

1569
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:24,730
from each of these guys back to

1570
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:26,730
you so here this guy

1571
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:30,250
so a pointer going this way

1572
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:33,040
this guy sets the pointer going this way

1573
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:36,450
in this guy point going this way that's my pi

1574
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:38,500
i think it's going to keep track of who

1575
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:39,790
cost me too

1576
01:45:39,790 --> 01:45:40,510
you know

1577
01:45:40,530 --> 01:45:44,730
to set my value to what it is

1578
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:50,000
so now we go in and we find the cheapest thing again

1579
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:52,190
and we're going to do it faster

1580
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:55,570
because the fast our OK so now we're going to go

1581
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:59,780
in reinforcement learning is called outcome devaluation

1582
01:45:59,830 --> 01:46:02,440
so here what happens is you train

1583
01:46:02,450 --> 01:46:03,660
the press ever

1584
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:05,950
in order to get food

1585
01:46:06,030 --> 01:46:08,020
and then after the rats trained

1586
01:46:08,030 --> 01:46:10,350
change the value of the food

1587
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:14,740
separately in a separate scenario not in the same box where the rats used depressing

1588
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:17,740
for food but like in the home case for instance

1589
01:46:18,810 --> 01:46:23,160
letting the rats eat the food and then injecting it with lithium chloride which makes

1590
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:26,750
rats feel really really sick to their stomach

1591
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:30,130
makes them not want to eat that food anymore it's like food poisoning happens to

1592
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:34,280
us to is called conditioned taste aversion you go to rest it's something you really

1593
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:37,690
bad stomach ache you don't ever want to go to that restaurant again are certainly

1594
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:41,450
not order that food so that's what happens to the rats here they don't want

1595
01:46:41,450 --> 01:46:44,270
to eat the food anymore you give them the food and they like they walk

1596
01:46:45,110 --> 01:46:47,650
that has the feel like throwing things at it

1597
01:46:47,650 --> 01:46:54,070
or another way to do this is to just make the round stated

1598
01:46:54,110 --> 01:46:58,060
on even for one another food just making really really say to give him as

1599
01:46:58,060 --> 01:47:00,630
much food as he wants so that now

1600
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:04,170
the racial food in the experiment has a much lower value

1601
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,390
in both cases

1602
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:10,770
now the question is will the rack continue pressing for the food

1603
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:14,200
and that's compared to iraq the didn't have this

1604
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:18,700
the valuations of a normal rat that was trained on this and then just tested

1605
01:47:18,710 --> 01:47:20,060
so we know that

1606
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:22,770
this track will continue pressing

1607
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:27,170
questions will these continue pressing at the same rate and the reason we're doing this

1608
01:47:27,170 --> 01:47:33,610
in in comparison situation is specifically because this test is usually done with no rewards

1609
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:36,770
so we don't want to see new learning

1610
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:42,020
want to see whether the rat put together its knowledge of contingency is what does

1611
01:47:42,020 --> 01:47:46,000
this leverpressing give me and its knowledge of what is the worth of this cheese

1612
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,070
with the reward function in the transition function

1613
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:56,530
are these going to be put together without new learning about the food

1614
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:58,710
and the result is

1615
01:47:59,530 --> 01:48:01,150
the results are

1616
01:48:01,190 --> 01:48:02,690
it depends

1617
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:07,080
if you train the rat only moderately so train the rat for four days to

1618
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:10,780
start with him in four sections each of them half an hour and then do

1619
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:13,490
the devaluation and then do the test you see

1620
01:48:13,490 --> 01:48:21,530
that rats press much less for the devalued reward for reward that was not devalued

1621
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:26,440
but if you train the more in the initial training of talking about

1622
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:27,920
in this stage

1623
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,190
the training for fifteen days they're not for four days

1624
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:35,240
they don't stop pressing

1625
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,820
even when the reward is devalued

1626
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:40,700
press the same

1627
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:48,020
this in this experiment they used to time t

1628
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:52,860
not chloride and there are different experiments a whole host of experiments shown this this

1629
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:57,920
you know i know i think this is holland's results in not killcross so this

1630
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:00,820
with lithium chloride

1631
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:02,600
with the poisoning

1632
01:49:02,610 --> 01:49:05,940
so it seems like animals will sometimes work for food they don't want and the

1633
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:08,490
reason i'm saying they don't want it

1634
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:10,160
even in this case

1635
01:49:10,190 --> 01:49:14,020
is that we can look at their magazine behavior which is how many times they

1636
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:17,330
go to the food magazine to actually eat the food and we see that in

1637
01:49:17,330 --> 01:49:22,740
both cases even after extensive training they go to the magazine last for the food

1638
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:27,490
is developed the watson developing this looks like it's not significant but it's within subject

1639
01:49:27,490 --> 01:49:30,460
design is significantly different these two

1640
01:49:31,370 --> 01:49:32,830
in both cases

1641
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:37,400
they don't go to get the food but in one case they continue pressing

1642
01:49:37,410 --> 01:49:38,860
to earn the food

1643
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:42,250
i saw question from side

1644
01:49:45,070 --> 01:49:49,770
and this is associated this kind of behavior after extensive training with what we know

1645
01:49:49,770 --> 01:49:54,570
about our daily life which is in our daily life action some has become automatically

1646
01:49:54,610 --> 01:49:59,410
call the habitual after the extensively trained if we repeat them again and again and

1647
01:49:59,410 --> 01:50:02,280
again we drive home to the same place every day

1648
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:04,450
then even when we move house

1649
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:07,910
we continue driving by mistake to the old place

1650
01:50:07,910 --> 01:50:12,030
although we know in our cognition and everything that we don't live there anymore it's

1651
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:15,870
not that we don't know the reward is not there anymore we just failed to

1652
01:50:15,870 --> 01:50:21,520
put two to two and two together and not drive to the old place

1653
01:50:21,530 --> 01:50:23,460
so this is been turned

1654
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:30,030
the same in rats habitual behavior where they continue pressing goal directed behavior when they

1655
01:50:30,030 --> 01:50:34,110
stop pressing whether directed tool goal they kind of

1656
01:50:34,130 --> 01:50:37,360
put together in their mind

1657
01:50:44,330 --> 01:50:46,150
made and stated

1658
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:59,660
right i understand

1659
01:50:59,850 --> 01:51:04,250
know this is a good question so theoretically with the devaluation really if as effective

1660
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:09,450
after extensive training as it was after moderate training and they take that so

1661
01:51:09,450 --> 01:51:13,070
sometimes here it's enough to do well poisoning and here you have to do three

1662
01:51:13,070 --> 01:51:18,240
poisoning three poisonings on three different days but they poison them until the point where

1663
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:20,660
they give the food and they just don't want to eat it

1664
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:23,500
and that's when they go to detect they put them back in the box is

1665
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:30,000
the labyrinth and test that so that's controlled for the the good question

1666
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:32,830
OK so we started in some cases

1667
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:35,960
in some cases animals are habitual in other cases

1668
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:37,850
in other cases animals are

1669
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:39,240
goal directed

1670
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:43,450
so people really really interested in this is starting to look at

1671
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:45,160
what areas of the brain

1672
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:49,730
lead to these kinds of behaviors in this kind of learning and what they saw

1673
01:51:49,730 --> 01:51:53,730
and also you only two results

1674
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:55,190
it's just to

1675
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:58,790
now in cumbria with all kinds of areas of the brain that mean nothing at

1676
01:51:58,790 --> 01:52:00,000
this point

1677
01:52:00,030 --> 01:52:05,780
is that there are some areas of the brain specifically the dorsolateral striatum

1678
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:12,910
in this experiment these overtrained rats so if you don't lesion their brain what they

1679
01:52:12,950 --> 01:52:17,700
going to do is going to continue responding in this in the devalued cases much

1680
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:19,230
as they responded in the

1681
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:20,820
non devalued case

1682
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:23,130
but if you lesion if you cut

1683
01:52:23,170 --> 01:52:27,910
the dorsolateral striatum out of the brain and then do all the training and everything

1684
01:52:27,910 --> 01:52:29,390
and then suddenly

1685
01:52:29,390 --> 01:52:35,000
their goal directed so they press less for devalued option than for the value adoption

1686
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,610
even after thirty days of training or as long as you want to train the

1687
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:42,110
never become habitual

1688
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:46,200
so the idea was that the dorsolateral striatum is the seat of habits

1689
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:52,480
if you don't have the dorsolateral striatum in your brain you can learn happens

1690
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:57,290
and this is also true if you don't in the dorsolateral straightaway you just depleting

1691
01:52:57,290 --> 01:53:01,390
dopamine from you kill all the neurons that

1692
01:53:01,530 --> 01:53:03,170
project to a

1693
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:05,310
yes and no OK

1694
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:12,520
with the tools we have an and the knowledge that we haven't been there before

1695
01:53:12,990 --> 01:53:15,420
absolutely yes

1696
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:22,990
I don't be negative but you don't have the cooperative spirit going on

1697
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,120
the chanting and don't know why

1698
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:31,640
the young engineers are sharper

1699
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:35,160
and no 1 was injured but don't know a whole lot more

1700
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:39,220
and irony

1701
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:43,040
but you don't get along well

1702
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:51,900
you know this is not only do you don't want to get out of here

1703
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:56,860
that would overhaul and that's this observation made it might might be that you know

1704
01:53:56,860 --> 01:54:02,710
might not always used to restricted and the goes up freehand management to not just

1705
01:54:02,710 --> 01:54:03,780
the working

1706
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:07,540
the 2nd thing is

1707
01:54:07,550 --> 01:54:12,790
they asked become and consult with them and they lost technical capability didn't using the

1708
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:19,470
engineers much after a certain time on the shuttle and then after the last accident

1709
01:54:19,510 --> 01:54:21,500
to the bring engineers and

1710
01:54:22,670 --> 01:54:28,160
I i've never looked at that and you know I'm I'm on the payroll but

1711
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:30,670
also the capability was was was

1712
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:39,020
greatly lacking and so we developed some ways to bring up to speed in about

1713
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:41,680
a year and a half profound which which happens

1714
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:53,420
observations about way out please all yoga class sometimes have I told management to syntactic

1715
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:57,360
there's a meeting and you tell somebody will be there at the time you be

1716
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,180
there at that time

1717
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:04,020
if tell somebody you Michael deliverable at that time and you make a deliverable that

1718
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:07,000
can be a man and a woman of the word

1719
01:55:07,910 --> 01:55:12,590
and I have found that like and don't know that think screw have too much

1720
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:17,950
that we set a multitude of did too because the 1st to secondary class there

1721
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:24,630
was I think can only in the sent back when Letterman the class the other

1722
01:55:24,930 --> 01:55:32,710
but but but learn or whatever you get along with folksy that you bodies they'll

1723
01:55:32,710 --> 01:55:37,450
be there for a lifetime and you going have some grief and they give some

1724
01:55:37,450 --> 01:55:42,410
headaches and you give you some with your thinking

1725
01:55:42,790 --> 01:55:49,110
work words that none of you had a great achievements that sometimes but that's major

1726
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:52,820
the hidden costs

1727
01:55:52,880 --> 01:56:00,610
about doing that because the user of the history the

1728
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:11,840
so that we can think of the of how the rest of and some test

1729
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:15,670
for hundreds of hours that was the total number of hours for all those tests

1730
01:56:15,670 --> 01:56:20,700
not per hour lecture together was minded artist 1 of the major question to see

1731
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:27,140
if the reduced number 1 . and 3 areas that we're working on right now

1732
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:34,320
that uh 1 reason is to bring the engineers to technical speed where they can

1733
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:38,940
stand up and be counted in you can estimate technical question that give you technical

1734
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:42,840
actions and this is my analysis and this is how I got back to do

1735
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:48,900
that we recommended back to Johnson spacecraft centers that do you better get you engineers

1736
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:53,340
be went on interest you get get to know how to make the calculations to

1737
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:57,980
run these programs you gotta be able to do all that you integration contractors they

1738
01:56:57,980 --> 01:57:02,280
need to have that capability and they've done on OK and they're really came up

1739
01:57:02,290 --> 01:57:07,820
to speed and the Mr. that also increases CFD capabilities and I'm very envious of

1740
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:11,240
what you can do with the however

1741
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:16,880
it hasn't decrease the amount of runs at the requesting it's increasing demand runs at

1742
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:22,000
their request because they do this little bitty analysis and use the cable tray going

1743
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:26,660
down there and the suggested go Sonic under the cable well I don't know was

1744
01:57:26,660 --> 01:57:31,070
it went on to say that we will use the data point here and a

1745
01:57:31,070 --> 01:57:35,900
data point here and actually if these shows can cosine candidate all we need to

1746
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:42,960
test estimate that's there and so ate could better don't think it will act like

1747
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:49,140
the the covariate did you wanna make sure and 1 day it the 1 day

1748
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:53,520
and I think yes that's going to happen but right now and there's still a

1749
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:57,640
lot of questions even in the city years man and on the right and on

1750
01:57:57,640 --> 01:58:03,660
the right hand and they always been accused of thinking what the right answer is

1751
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:08,580
if you give it to you and that's that's really not true a number that

1752
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:13,480
was for a number of years but there that CFD is so great and the

1753
01:58:13,510 --> 01:58:18,560
use overflow by the way is 1 of primary the contract and and as

1754
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:20,210
the question

1755
01:58:22,010 --> 01:58:30,370
you have a question like that this is not an easy thing to that maybe

1756
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:37,610
that talk about showing talk about the Apollo from Mr. before Apollo we went to

1757
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:42,750
the point at which the with a single string avionics systems we when I have

1758
01:58:42,750 --> 01:58:45,440
you what computer

1759
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:50,300
on the command service module we had the 1 service propulsion system to get you

1760
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:56,750
out of 1 orbit to agenda and I think today

1761
01:58:56,750 --> 01:58:59,880
it will be very difficult to

1762
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:04,330
I do that I think you're probably going to have to

1763
01:59:04,640 --> 01:59:10,460
have multiple stroke multiple strings you have about escape system and all of the escape

1764
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:15,860
system something in that context may be more difficult to think that tools you have

1765
01:59:15,870 --> 01:59:20,370
today will make it easier but I do think what we know today is just

1766
01:59:20,370 --> 01:59:25,870
like the best set on the understanding a little bit about the management board it's

1767
01:59:25,870 --> 01:59:31,140
gonna be having some respects my comment is that next time we go to find

1768
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:32,710
out how hard it really was

1769
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:36,520
because I don't think it's going to be hard to do this that's not personal

1770
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:40,460
feeling that the people agree with 1 of the toughest decisions we ever made the

1771
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:45,160
space program that's never talked about it but this is what we decided to

1772
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:47,680
public was probably

1773
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:52,130
the most fantastic mentioned that we ever came up with that was the 1st time

1774
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:54,590
we left the influence of gravity

1775
01:59:55,130 --> 02:00:00,670
we went into orbit around we get out of land on the moon but we

1776
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:04,630
did everything we had to do for the 1st time I think that was probably

1777
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:11,470
the boldest decisions of the that mass and the government men and again I look

1778
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:17,250
back amateur how we will make that decision protested cost 1 man led the attack

1779
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:22,870
was george lowe whose deputy was to measure the Apollo program just space so that

1780
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:29,510
we can get the administrator and they became friends have oppressive of of principal techniques

1781
02:00:29,510 --> 02:00:32,360
that was really fantastic project

1782
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:34,570
one should dismiss

1783
02:00:34,580 --> 02:00:36,620
my second example

1784
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:40,770
of getting personal is what's called the four one nine scans in advance

1785
02:00:40,820 --> 02:00:46,660
fy scan which you've all received email saying you know i've got ten million dollars

1786
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:49,990
in the bank account in wherever they need to transfer

1787
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,910
and if you get sucked into that you pay an advance fee to enable the

1788
02:00:53,910 --> 02:00:57,130
transfer and you never see it again of course

1789
02:00:57,140 --> 02:01:00,600
and you might think who on earth would fall for that nobody in this room

1790
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:03,360
clearly but people still do

1791
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:04,660
the figures here

1792
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:05,950
the blue ones

1793
02:01:05,970 --> 02:01:09,110
to the left of the two thousand six the red ones

1794
02:01:09,150 --> 02:01:14,000
to the right of the two thousand five because this is a hundred million US

1795
02:01:15,650 --> 02:01:17,880
in the united states

1796
02:01:17,890 --> 02:01:21,260
the next highest is the UK and goes down

1797
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:24,460
so people do still fall for this

1798
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:28,630
one of the reasons they fall for well with see later on it can be

1799
02:01:28,630 --> 02:01:30,580
more complicated more subtle

1800
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:33,060
than it looks

1801
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:36,550
i've been talking about how large these things are in terms of money

1802
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:38,950
let's put some other kinds of numbers on the

1803
02:01:38,990 --> 02:01:44,680
my group deals with the data involving millions or billions of banking transactions that's what

1804
02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:47,040
really what we're interested in

1805
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:49,050
some of the biggest UK banks

1806
02:01:49,060 --> 02:01:51,000
carry out billions of

1807
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:52,990
credit card transactions a year

1808
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,710
but one terror just one terrorism case can against one or two stops suspects can

1809
02:01:57,710 --> 02:02:01,040
involve analyzing that sort of amount of data

1810
02:02:01,050 --> 02:02:05,160
six thousand got but eight thousand CD's two hundred phones and so on

1811
02:02:05,170 --> 02:02:12,890
a lot of police resources going into is the source of making up these numbers

1812
02:02:13,830 --> 02:02:15,850
now that might get down to

1813
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:19,880
in particular area that myself my group mainly working

1814
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:22,080
the first part of the group mainly working

1815
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:24,500
the banking fraud

1816
02:02:28,090 --> 02:02:30,050
banking fraud got many aspects

1817
02:02:30,530 --> 02:02:36,550
here are some i referred to identity theft money laundering is is something i

1818
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:40,530
you can say a little bit about i carried out big money laundering project

1819
02:02:40,550 --> 02:02:44,100
anti-money laundering project with one of the

1820
02:02:44,220 --> 02:02:47,440
big investment banks in the city of london

1821
02:02:48,730 --> 02:02:50,990
i've never seen i've never seen

1822
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,530
so many zeros after pound sign

1823
02:02:53,580 --> 02:02:56,900
it is quite awe-inspiring

1824
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:59,720
with their it's all part of the

1825
02:02:59,730 --> 02:03:03,880
it was transferring money between different accounts and some of those accounts for different countries

1826
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:04,770
of course

1827
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:08,160
so germany transfers the sum of money to the united states

1828
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:09,810
it will be

1829
02:03:12,470 --> 02:03:20,720
an important and particularly tough aspects of banking fraud is employed for all staff fraud

1830
02:03:20,770 --> 02:03:25,940
in particular sleepers who are inserted into the bank and sit there working in perfectly

1831
02:03:26,050 --> 02:03:27,800
perfectly legitimate ways

1832
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:34,700
but can become process i came across an example of this not long ago

1833
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:39,930
i should say by the stuff guess fraud in banking is

1834
02:03:39,970 --> 02:03:46,400
perpetrated by organised crime syndicates it's generally not individuals that occasionally get in the u

1835
02:03:46,510 --> 02:03:49,260
UK recently there was the secretary who stole

1836
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,440
four million pounds i think from her

1837
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:55,820
employers who ran a hedge fund something like that he didn't notice it gone

1838
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:57,510
obviously was a hedge fund

1839
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:04,060
but normally fraud in banking is perpetrated by organised crime syndicates and i came across

1840
02:04:04,060 --> 02:04:05,440
an example

1841
02:04:05,450 --> 02:04:06,540
in which

1842
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:10,230
one of the syndicate to targeted very bright

1843
02:04:10,230 --> 02:04:12,960
student computer science mathematics whatever some

1844
02:04:15,790 --> 02:04:17,270
early on in his career

1845
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:22,330
identified he was particularly clever and that he was impoverished didn't have much money was

1846
02:04:22,330 --> 02:04:24,350
finding it hard to make ends meet

1847
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:29,120
so they gave him a handsome bursary and awards scholarships

1848
02:04:29,210 --> 02:04:30,400
and they also

1849
02:04:30,580 --> 02:04:35,710
equipped him with a very nice flat in whatever city he was studying

1850
02:04:35,730 --> 02:04:40,560
and they did this throughout his three years keeping in basically in lots of money

1851
02:04:40,580 --> 02:04:45,140
they the condition being that he would go and work for them or whoever they

1852
02:04:45,140 --> 02:04:51,150
nominated when he graduated so he graduated with an absolutely excellent degree

1853
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:53,990
and he got a job in a bank had put him in the bank

1854
02:04:54,010 --> 02:04:57,740
and he works in this bank for a number of years being successfully was a

1855
02:04:57,920 --> 02:04:59,810
working very bright lad

1856
02:04:59,930 --> 02:05:03,180
and he worked his way up and then one day he was very successful one

1857
02:05:03,950 --> 02:05:08,840
he was put in charge of all the incoming checks and transfers coming into the

1858
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:17,040
nobody else was there because they trust limiting working for a number of years

1859
02:05:18,690 --> 02:05:21,230
to the end of the day he disappeared and all the money had been paid

1860
02:05:21,230 --> 02:05:23,010
into another camp gone

1861
02:05:23,030 --> 02:05:24,940
completely elsewhere

1862
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:28,590
tens of millions of pounds

1863
02:05:28,620 --> 02:05:31,770
the cost what happened after this is also interesting

1864
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:36,590
the police managed to track this he disappeared the police managed to track him down

1865
02:05:36,650 --> 02:05:41,150
but remember this sort of crimes perpetrated by organised crime syndicates

1866
02:05:41,940 --> 02:05:45,900
try to ring the people who have been providing who provided him with a scholarship

1867
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:49,710
and support over all these years and put him in his job and of course

1868
02:05:49,730 --> 02:05:54,120
there was nobody there they just vanished he was left face music by himself

1869
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:58,340
sometimes these people think in really long term

1870
02:05:58,490 --> 02:06:02,500
sort of ways

1871
02:06:02,530 --> 02:06:04,780
OK so my main focus is in

1872
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:10,630
the retail consumer banking sector that involves things like personal banking credit cards mortgages car

1873
02:06:11,990 --> 02:06:13,290
and so on

1874
02:06:13,310 --> 02:06:17,330
the reason i am particularly interested in this area is because it's natural area for

1875
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:20,470
statistician you know the numbers are large

1876
02:06:20,510 --> 02:06:25,510
the numbers with pound signs in front of large it's natural area statisticians

1877
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:28,950
so we do a lot of work in in the banking area in general not

1878
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:31,220
just for

1879
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:33,010
let's look at

1880
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:34,450
plastic card

1881
02:06:34,490 --> 02:06:35,690
fraud data

1882
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:39,450
give you more ideas sort of problems we're going to encounter i'm going to

1883
02:06:40,450 --> 02:06:41,830
i've listed them here

1884
02:06:41,850 --> 02:06:45,500
but i'm going to look at some of them in detail in the following slides

1885
02:06:45,550 --> 02:06:50,920
first as i say there are many transactions often billions this means any other algorithms

1886
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:52,120
must be efficient

1887
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:54,100
let me remind you that

1888
02:06:54,130 --> 02:06:57,690
in data mining there are two kinds of data mining one is building a global

1889
02:06:58,750 --> 02:07:02,480
principle in many cases you can use the sample of data to do that class

1890
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:08,220
segmentation or aggression whatever you don't necessarily have to use all billion cases

1891
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:11,990
but if your aim is anomaly detection fraud detection or something like that

1892
02:07:12,030 --> 02:07:14,720
well you do have to look at each case

1893
02:07:14,730 --> 02:07:18,280
you can't just take a sample of ten thousand after the billion

1894
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:20,290
you probably missed the fraught if you do that

1895
02:07:20,330 --> 02:07:23,680
so this means means at algorithms coefficients

1896
02:07:23,690 --> 02:07:26,280
you will find that there are mixed variable types

1897
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:29,480
generally knocks text or image in this area

1898
02:07:29,480 --> 02:07:32,980
but there are categorical and continuous whatever variables

1899
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:36,070
i've already referred to the large number of variables and i'll show you an example

1900
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:39,750
some of the variables are incomprehensible

1901
02:07:39,770 --> 02:07:45,500
and many are irrelevant so they might for example be a numerical code showing the

1902
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:50,200
type of sale credit card terminal which is being used which typically will be important

1903
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:52,330
is possible it is typically one the

1904
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:54,640
and we want know

1905
02:07:54,670 --> 02:07:57,490
people we working with the banks were no

1906
02:07:57,510 --> 02:08:00,710
what those codes mean

1907
02:08:00,710 --> 02:08:02,000
there are of course

1908
02:08:02,030 --> 02:08:07,560
dramatically different misclassification cost misclassifying a fraud as legitimate failing to detect one is much

1909
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:09,370
more serious than the other way around

1910
02:08:09,370 --> 02:08:12,420
there are many ways of committing fraud give examples

1911
02:08:12,630 --> 02:08:19,500
the class sizes are unbalanced the normal sort of figure border magnitude ball-park figure four
