1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
and these direct direct sum of four

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,640
one dimensional algebras

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,830
and this

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,770
you can obtain by violating the ball in every polynomial belongs here

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,790
in two

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,620
roots of that is in the elements of the spectrum

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,880
OK so this is a well-defined is an isomorphism

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,780
and in the set of in the case of x minus on this is exactly

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,880
the discrete fourier transform

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,720
that is the matrix representation

11
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,730
in general i mean for

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,430
arbitrary polynomial with discrete

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,290
but with distinct

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,770
it's a vandermonde

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,760
which is exactly fifty

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,300
of and for our example

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:58,020
but this implies that we can afford to computed using order looks square and algorithms

18
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,450
and this is a very good news for

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,700
for computation

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,980
OK so

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,150
all this means is that finding transforms

22
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,390
that approach the two time for a transform

23
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:21,500
as n goes to infinity reduces to polynomial find polynomial families was set of fruits

24
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,010
approach the unit circle

25
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,530
our goal now becomes to find such families of polynomials

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,330
and we have first define what is done

27
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,430
a set of rules for family point so if you have a fine opening hours

28
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,660
with degrees

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,160
with increasing biggest for the of the degree and

30
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,890
and then some

31
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,880
complex number is a limit of zeros for this family if there is a sequence

32
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,380
of complex elements so that

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,610
they are the roots of

34
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,130
polynomial in this family

35
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,800
and their limit

36
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,180
is exactly easy

37
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,480
so how should we do this

38
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,470
i'll just state our main result

39
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,380
namely if we define

40
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,450
the family of polynomials

41
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,660
it looks like this

42
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,450
we can characterize exactly

43
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,270
all the limits of zeros for this family one units and namely

44
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,630
they are all the points on the unit circle

45
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,780
and they are all the points inside the unit circle that our roots

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,150
of the

47
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,900
free term here

48
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,470
and all the points outside the unit circle the roots of the

49
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,700
it's quite efficient of the dominant term here is some

50
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,660
so what does

51
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,550
all of these polynomials actually look like

52
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,820
and we could just to see them

53
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,530
in the order of the

54
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,630
our ex

55
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,750
and we can see that we can cluster

56
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,770
the equations corresponding to the nonzero coefficients corresponding to these

57
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,200
polynomial is here

58
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,620
we only imposed a condition that the first cluster and the last cluster is nonzero

59
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,970
the others could be zero but the

60
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:39,090
the all lie on these equally spaced locations

61
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,280
we can even go further and make a polynomial family that

62
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,730
was degrees

63
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,380
increases by one every time as opposed to viki we're here

64
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:03,050
i'm not going to be those what essentially it's the trivial application here

65
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:08,290
and how do we actually get to prove this result how do we

66
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,960
you get to prove that

67
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,910
a limit of zeros for this family

68
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,240
is exactly what they say it is will use the alcohol advice here

69
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,950
OK this is the result

70
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,830
from the seventies

71
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,800
and before stating that

72
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,970
here we need a few preliminary so for family of polynomials satisfy this

73
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,860
linear recurrence where these

74
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,610
coefficients are constant

75
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,490
its characteristic equation

76
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,010
like this

77
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,250
of course

78
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,110
each value of x

79
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,590
this equation will have some fruits lambda one

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,450
lambda n

81
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,950
the roots are distinct for some values then obviously we can write

82
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,700
we can write the general term of the sequence

83
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,620
like this using some

84
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,360
polynomials that depend on x and the roots

85
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,900
and part of course if they are some rules that are equal you could do

86
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,880
the same tricks that you do four

87
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,000
linear recurrences with numbers not only

88
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,140
and we can find

89
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,470
we can find these polynomials of

90
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,660
in the usual way by letting

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,820
and going from zero to

92
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,580
and minus one and this uniquely

93
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,180
produces these these quotations

94
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,300
the degeneracy conditions that

95
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,740
sweep under the rug here but we actually don't need them

96
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,170
but the theorem does

97
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,600
are that m is the smallest degree

98
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,260
over any linear recurrence that this family satisfies

99
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,880
we've seen them it how that influences our results

100
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:19,440
and we don't want to have the situation that

101
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,870
two of these

102
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:29,070
routes to these functions only differ by multiplicative constant for all values of x so

103
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,830
we don't want to fight

104
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,130
OK other than that

105
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,380
with all the conditions stated above that is the limit of zero for

106
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,310
the one norm your family

107
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,230
if and only if

108
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,380
there exist an ordering of the characteristic roots

109
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,380
such that one of these two

110
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,830
mutually exclusive conditions that it satisfies namely

111
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,880
one of the roots is strictly larger than all of the others

112
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,590
the is the root of the polynomial

113
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,370
the coefficients corresponding to this route

114
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,120
there exist at least

115
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,210
two routes that are equal in absolute value

116
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,260
and maximum in a value

117
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,540
and these are all the

118
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,960
this is a lecture six linear algebra

119
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,830
we're at the start of this new chapter

120
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,920
chapter three in the text

121
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,990
which is really getting to the

122
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,800
centre of linear algebra

123
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,900
i had time to make

124
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,550
first started on the at the end of lecture five

125
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,370
but now i would like to say

126
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:57,440
r is officially the lecture on vector spaces and subspaces

127
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,430
and then especially

128
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,300
there are two

129
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,650
back to some place that were especially interested in

130
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,570
one is the column space of a matrix

131
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,470
the other is the null space of the matrix

132
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,770
i got to tell you what those are

133
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,420
first to remember from lecture five

134
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,110
what is the vector space

135
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,730
it's a bunch of actors

136
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,420
where i'm allowed where i can and i can add any two two vectors

137
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,670
in this space

138
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:38,090
and the answer is there is in this space

139
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,780
or i can multiply any vector in the space by any constant

140
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,700
and the result stays in this space

141
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,330
so that in fact if i combine those two into one

142
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,730
you can see that if i could have and i can multiply by by numbers

143
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,540
that really means that i can take a linear combination

144
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,280
so the quick way to say it is that all

145
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,620
linear combinations the

146
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,200
any multiple of the

147
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,060
any multiple of w stay in this space

148
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,250
so can i give you examples that are vector spaces

149
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,580
and also some examples that are not

150
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,620
to make that point clear

151
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,420
so suppose i'm in

152
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,080
three dimensions

153
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,260
then one way to get this one

154
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,020
one is the whole three-dimensional space

155
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,200
so the whole space are three

156
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,950
three-dimensional space

157
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,960
it would be an vector space because if i have a couple of actors i

158
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,080
can add them and i'm certainly OK and they follow all the rules

159
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,410
so are free is easy

160
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,160
i'm interested also in

161
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,140
some space

162
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,230
there the words some space

163
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,410
that's space that some vectors inside

164
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,010
the given space inside or three

165
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,580
still make up the vector space of their of their own the vector space inside

166
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,830
the vector space

167
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,490
and the simplest example was applied soap

168
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,830
can i just get there

169
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,200
there is a plane

170
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,510
it's got to go through the origin

171
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,200
and of course it goes infinitely far

172
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,170
that that's the subspace now

173
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,480
you see that if i have

174
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,330
two vectors on the plane

175
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,350
and i have done the results they

176
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,710
in the play

177
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,700
if i take an vector in the plane and i multiplied by minus two

178
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,380
i'm still in the plane

179
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,920
so that claim is the subspace

180
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,760
so let me just make that point

181
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,670
through zero

182
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,050
prove that their own zero zero

183
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,110
in of

184
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,860
and also

185
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,510
another subspace would be aligned

186
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,450
o line through zero zeros of the line have to go through the origin all

187
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:16,740
subspaces of god contain the origin contains zero zero

188
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,410
so this line

189
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,830
in the summer

190
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,980
why is a sum

191
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,010
really if i

192
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,670
i want really correctly i should say

193
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,340
a subspace of

194
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,500
are three

195
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,520
i that of our three was like understood

196
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,040
now so let me call this plane p

197
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,490
let me call this line l

198
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,480
let me ask you

199
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,320
other set other sets of vectors

200
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,990
suppose i took

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,550
so here's the first question suppose i take two subspaces

202
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,860
like pnl

203
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,060
and i just put them together

204
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,730
take their union

205
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,630
take all the vectors

206
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,930
so now i

207
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,770
you've got pnl in mind here

208
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,820
i have

209
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,820
two subspaces

210
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,040
two subspaces

211
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,480
and for example

212
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,860
a plane ally

213
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,220
i want to ask you about

214
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,730
the union of all

215
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,990
the union bound

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,980
this is all vector

217
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,110
or but

218
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:51,050
is that a subspace

219
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,850
is this the substrate

220
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,770
or not

221
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,620
because when i just want to be sure

222
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,120
and i've got

223
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,160
central idea

224
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,480
suppose i take the vectors in the plane

225
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,960
the vectors on line

226
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,360
put them together

227
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,210
so i've got a bunch of actors is the subspace can you give me like

228
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,440
so the camera can hear it or maybe

229
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,500
the tape

230
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,320
can you say yes or no

231
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,030
do i have a subspace if i put

232
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,690
if i take

233
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,110
all right

234
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,490
you on the plane y for all and all the ones on the line

235
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,420
and the

236
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,160
so join them together but i'm not taking this guy

237
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,910
actually i'm not taking most of them because most vectors are

238
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,370
not on the line or a plane their of tomorrow

239
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,780
do i have a subspace

240
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,420
right thank you know

241
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:03,180
because why not because i can because if i

242
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,920
that that requirement isn't satisfied

243
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,190
w is independent of fx the dispersion of w doesn't depend on how ai intervene

244
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:16,560
whether intervene so this is a constant

245
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,730
i do better

246
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,840
because can

247
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,570
OK so so it's nice linear regression

248
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,880
and b and b it is the coefficient of x and it's causal regression coefficient

249
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,020
in the sense that these models

250
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,000
how the expected value y

251
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,150
varies with an applied

252
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,210
the value of models learning x arise around the user going in setting it and

253
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,670
that's an interesting thing to know about

254
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,960
and it will be lovely to learn about it

255
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,900
it's cause it it has causal meaning if i could believe this story and the

256
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,900
linear regression

257
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:59,190
problem is that can actually are estimated from observational data just like that and you

258
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,980
can see why because

259
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:06,540
if i take in the observation regime if i do this then i get the

260
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,000
expected this term becomes explaination that if w given x little x in the observation

261
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,170
regime and that correlated in the observation regime so it probably depends on x and

262
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,980
therefore i can't extricated from this to

263
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,340
so i'm in trouble if all of observing x y and observation regime not suppose

264
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,340
i'm not just going to be able to observe w but there's something else i

265
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:36,040
can say so let's add to the story there is another variable z

266
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,340
that has the properties first of all

267
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,710
it's sort of something which is closely associated with x which is why the cause

268
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:49,500
i care about and it doesn't depend it's supposed to be

269
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,270
out there it doesn't depend on which freedom regime and talking about those of pre

270
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,860
treatment variable if you like a cup example shortly and

271
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,480
and let's suppose that i can believe is independent of all these things which are

272
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,920
getting in my way so something sort from outside which is quite independently only

273
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,340
influence it has israel association works

274
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:18,750
and also other missing arrows this matter here says it doesn't affect even if i

275
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,500
tell you z is this ritual y given everything else is still that modular components

276
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,860
linear regression if you like so

277
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,710
is still why only depends on w and x so is it is an instrument

278
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,480
and if you could intervene in z which may or may not be the case

279
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,860
you could actually maybe try and which affect the value x

280
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,570
possibly in a heavy-handed way you could is not the same as going infecting itself

281
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,500
influencing is stochastically

282
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,370
and if you work through the analysis with all those additional assumptions find defined this

283
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,820
so i go through the details but you've

284
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,270
here's somebody could estimate from data you can observe what so we observing z although

285
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,540
not yet so they been observed the expectation y given

286
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,730
the observed values that do that so this is something estimate

287
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,670
and here is the same thing with x and say this is something estimable from

288
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,440
these in the observation regime

289
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,000
you might build linear models for both these responses and then that's nice and easy

290
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,790
you could more generally an important point to notice is that here is an equation

291
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:29,520
relating possible quality quantities these two functions of z

292
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,070
and they had this linear relationship

293
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,420
and there's this constant beta which comes in there and if only these things are

294
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,770
trivial enough

295
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:43,110
you can estimate beta particularly in the case where these have linear regressions then beta

296
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:48,400
is just the ratio of the two regression coefficients which is the standard econometrics instrumental

297
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,840
variable form

298
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,710
so that's made by the columns of what i want but i observe something else

299
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,960
and getting in trouble

300
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,290
get beta

301
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,270
rather heavily on the linear regression assumption that you got problems without it so the

302
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:13,400
binary case for example you can't actually estimate the causal effect exactly

303
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,570
what you can typically do is get bounds upper and lower bounds on the average

304
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,420
that had a 1 in the free variables or 0 1 and 0 and the

305
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,510
free variables and then we filled in define the others

306
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,260
I forgot what they were but maybe it was that

307
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:37,270
that was a special solution and then there was another special solutions that had that

308
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,400
free variables 0 and this free variable equal 1

309
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,420
and I have to fill those in

310
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,330
that's c can I remember how those filling and maybe this was a minus 2

311
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,200
and this was that 2 possibly

312
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,920
I think probably that's right

313
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,010
I'm not yet

314
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,180
2 room

315
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,400
the criteria

316
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,400
I would have to remember what are my equations

317
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,990
that's a tonight rather than go way back to that board that we remember the

318
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:16,310
1st equation was to X 3 + 2 x 4

319
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,750
equaling 0 now

320
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,640
because I'm looking for the guys in the null space

321
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,750
so I said x 4 to be 1

322
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:32,270
and the 2nd equation that I didn't propaganda minus 2 for the 1st and then

323
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,270
yeah so I think that's right

324
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,590
minus 4

325
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,460
and to give 0

326
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,220
OK those with the special solution

327
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,550
what we do to get the complete solution

328
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,660
how do I get the complete solution now I multiply this by anything

329
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,130
the ones say

330
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,900
and I multiply this by anything I take any combination

331
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,200
you remember that's how we describe the null space

332
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,860
the null space consists of all combinations

333
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,330
of so this is x

334
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,620
all combinations of the special solution

335
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,090
there were 2

336
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,960
special solutions because there were 2 free variables

337
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,730
and we want to make that count is complete

338
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,470
that carefully now

339
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,050
but just while I'm up here so there's that's what that that's the kind of

340
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:34,120
answer I'm looking for is a a constant multiplying this guy

341
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,970
is 0 free constant that multiplies expert taking

342
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,810
no way

343
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,130
right x particular solves

344
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,700
a x 3 will be I'm not allowed to multiply that by 3

345
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,490
but a x and I'm allowed to multiply xn by 3

346
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,720
or add to another

347
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,790
because I keep getting 0 on the right

348
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,250
OK so

349
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:03,730
so again XP is 1 particular x and a whole subspace

350
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:08,660
right is 1 guy + + anything from a subspace

351
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,970
let me draw

352
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,290
but because try

353
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,550
I want to draw

354
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:24,720
I monograph all this graph that I want I want to plot all solutions

355
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,460
X so what dimension

356
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,970
this is an unfortunate point

357
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:41,420
how many components is X for the for unknown so I have to draw up

358
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,590
a four-dimensional

359
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,070
picture on this cheap blackboard OK so

360
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,140
here we go X 1

361
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,510
Einstein could do it but the

362
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,860
is is that those

363
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,720
representing 4 dimensional space

364
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,720
where are my solutions

365
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,810
do my solution form subspace

366
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,880
don't do does the set of solutions to a x will be former subspace no

367
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,720
what is it actually look like the subspaces in this picture

368
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,460
this part of the subspace right

369
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:36,030
that something like 2 dimensional because I get to parameters so it's I'm thinking of

370
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:42,640
this null space as to low-dimensional subspaces inside our 4

371
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,970
now I have to tell you and will tell you put next time what does

372
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,900
it mean to say subspace what's the dimension of a subspace but you see what

373
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,390
it's gonna be

374
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,790
it's the number of

375
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,900
independent constant so we can choose

376
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,440
so somehow there be a 2 dimensional subspace

377
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,880
not aligned and not a three-dimensional

378
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:12,160
playing but only to a low-dimensional guide but it doesn't go through the origin

379
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:19,400
because it goes through this point so there's x particular X particularly somewhere here x

380
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:26,120
particularly so it's somehow as subspace and I try to draw that way

381
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:35,240
it's a two-dimensional subspaces that goes through x particulars

382
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:41,530
and then onwards by so there that particular and I added on X and and

383
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:49,950
OK let me skip the the OEM part for parametric distributional clustering and just show

384
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,510
you on that image that you have already seen before

385
00:23:52,990 --> 00:24:00,410
how how you you will find solutions at different temperatures at very high temperature you

386
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:05,870
basically get this sort of these these salt and pepper type image you have six

387
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,190
different colors in here and you see it's basically a random choice which of these

388
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:16,040
colours you select you lower the temperature a little bit and the most dominant structure

389
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,580
according to your cost function start to appear

390
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,910
so here you get sort of for condensation of grey values in that area and

391
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,090
in that area and these if you remember these are the black parents in the

392
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,540
in the in the landsat the image and the black parts are coming from from

393
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:37,770
the is not in the lede sentences into the aperture radar image and he comes

394
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,780
from the radar shadow

395
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,530
you go down and all of a sudden small structures appear

396
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:48,280
you still have a mixture between yellow and blue here and between two

397
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,440
blue and you go further down

398
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,800
and at the end

399
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,940
at the end you basically get this type of of picture we have now much

400
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,540
better solutions than that but i only have to meet you in this in this

401
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,820
presentation format here from from that image

402
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:16,440
you have the same form only on what is plotted here for different temperatures it's

403
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:21,190
the kullback leibler divergence to the mean histogram so if i if i do the

404
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:27,540
same thing in histogram space i have to somehow characterize my different solutions and it's

405
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:32,870
it's it's i do that by plotting by plotting the

406
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:39,210
the the the the prototypical histogram for one of the segments by basically plugging the

407
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,290
distance of support to histogram to the mean histogram

408
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:49,330
and you get this abrupt changes in solution space which basically give you these these

409
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,860
these these splits

410
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,440
let me not going to that because i was too much time you can use

411
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,410
a multiscale approach for it

412
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,440
i guess have five minutes

413
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,700
yeah because we start a little bit late but i don't want to go in

414
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,200
the negotiation phase after one and a half hours it's usually

415
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,420
we have already

416
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:32,730
OK the third part i think is is inherently connected to the generalization issue basically

417
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,240
how many clusters do i have up to now i used his magic number k

418
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:45,540
as an input somebody told me how many clusters i have to use ideally i

419
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,620
would say well maybe i know an upper bound on the number of clusters but

420
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,670
please if if if it happened to be

421
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:59,160
an image where two of my envisioned clusters cannot be separated on the basis of

422
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:04,410
the data are you know the algorithm should figure out by itself that rather than

423
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:09,580
ten which is the maximum number of clusters in applica occasion i should only use

424
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:15,200
and then discard in some way on all of the the the the of the

425
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,360
other segments so that's the cluster validation problem and there are a couple of approaches

426
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,730
to it

427
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,450
the most prominent ones are by his son and insurance this is the minimum description

428
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:30,270
and think of the subspace as being the circulation subspace

429
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,370
o of the corresponding graph

430
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,780
then this problem becomes

431
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:40,770
find the circulation within the graph that minimizes the sum of our course

432
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,080
it's a classical problem

433
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,850
then we have a block separable problems

434
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,810
with linear constraints

435
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:56,060
special case of linear programming quadratic programming just about any separable problem with convex cost

436
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,060
in linear constraints maps into this

437
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,640
let me also mention that even though we have a subspace constrained here

438
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,470
i can easily change that too

439
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,160
a late general linear constraints simply by translation argument so

440
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:16,780
this is not any any loss in generality ballistic the constraints to be a subspace

441
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,130
the next special case is the french duality framework

442
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,820
now here there are only two terms

443
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,990
and the subspace has this form here

444
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,700
this the coupling between the axis they have to be

445
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,150
the second component has to be a linear transformation of the of the first

446
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,290
and then the of the experiment of programming problem

447
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,810
reduces to this one which is the classical form of french about perhaps you have

448
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:51,030
seen it with you it was to be identity here it's just a small extension

449
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,820
spencer duality has become very popular these days because of a special case in conic

450
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,090
semidefinite programming second order programming all of these

451
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:07,030
are special cases of fenchel duality where one of these functions is the indicator function

452
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,540
of the car

453
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,750
is the

454
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,930
the the

455
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,450
right to the the

456
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,340
indicator function course

457
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:22,100
OK the case of some of functions which i mentioned in connection with machine learning

458
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,260
one of the components correspond to batches of data

459
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,590
notice that this is different than this because here i have a dependence

460
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,860
on the vector x before vector x in here i have a dependence on the

461
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,180
other components

462
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,970
however by introducing a subspace of this form were all the components are equal

463
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,350
then this problem

464
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,090
with this subspace becomes this

465
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,930
so some of functions are special cases in there may be some additional constraints here

466
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,800
note also that fact extended real valued

467
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:01,390
they may embody constraints themselves

468
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,490
now the dual problem to this it turns out to be

469
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,970
very semantically identical just the FZI placed by the conjugate into the subspaces replaced by

470
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,860
so far in the derivation of this i don't want to go into details but

471
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,220
it's very simple

472
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:21,300
what we do is we convert the problem into an equivalent problem by introducing some

473
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,670
o valuables z

474
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,810
zeid which we make equal to x y

475
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,170
now this defines

476
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,840
linear constraints to which we can assign the lagrange multipliers

477
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,970
four milligrams in

478
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,640
and then minimize over x and z

479
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,610
and then after you do that

480
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,150
you obtain

481
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,330
this dual function

482
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,310
of y of the lagrange multipliers

483
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,370
but now you exploit separability here

484
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,030
so the macs the minimisation

485
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,860
breaks down into components and then

486
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,880
what comes out of the conjugate

487
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,510
of the of ice

488
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:04,680
and and also there's a subspace constraint coming from the inner product here the unconstrained

489
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,950
optimisation with respect to the

490
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,960
so that's the dual problem

491
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,170
there's also a sign change for the optimal value of this is minus the optimal

492
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,170
value of the people there

493
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,110
an impressive sight

494
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,800
so these are the two problems and

495
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,660
now let me mention

496
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:31,880
duality conditions i mentioned earlier the rockefellers condition are very powerful for the case of

497
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,450
component is one-dimensional

498
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,660
nine components multidimensional

499
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:42,350
the optimality conditions are not quite as strong but still there are fairly strong

500
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,450
and is a certain vector some conditions which is in my paper which involves something

501
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,600
called the epsilon subdifferential

502
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:50,640
of this

503
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,890
function here

504
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:56,790
air flows and causes things to change

505
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,940
and then there's another thing which is

506
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:07,900
the sciences and and engineering which i'm going to talk about under the heading of

507
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,300
so let me

508
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,220
let me explain this

509
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,620
i don't want to belabor it because i just in doing this in order to

510
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:33,190
introduce you to the ideas on your problems that which is the first

511
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,370
OK so this so on problem set one

512
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:41,980
you have an example which is based on a simplified model of gps

513
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,220
sort the flat earth model

514
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,090
in that situation wealthy flats just horizontal line like this

515
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,640
and then you have a satellite

516
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,920
which is over here

517
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,610
preferably above

518
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,910
the earth

519
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,030
there there

520
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,420
the satellite is x knows exactly where the system

521
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:12,000
he knows exactly where the point directly below the satellite is so this point is

522
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,520
treated as known

523
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,230
i'm sitting here

524
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,770
with my little GPS device

525
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,060
i want to know where i am

526
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:37,280
and the way i locate where i and is i communicate with the satellites

527
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,420
by radio signals and i can measure the distance here which is called h

528
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,440
and then the system will compute this horizontal distance

529
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,280
which is

530
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,670
which is l

531
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:57,960
so in other words what is measured

532
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,240
so h measured

533
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,690
radio waves and rocks

534
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,480
various clocks

535
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,660
and then

536
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,430
l is deduced

537
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,170
from h

538
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:24,990
and what's critical in all of these systems is that you don't know age exactly

539
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,080
there's an error

540
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,470
in h

541
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,950
which will denote delta h there is some degree of uncertainty

542
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:38,340
the main uncertainty in GPS is

543
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,220
from the ionosphere

544
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,090
there are lots of corrections are made

545
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,930
of all kinds

546
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,660
and also if you're inside building it's a problem to measure but it's it's an

547
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,630
extremely important issue

548
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,390
there's all explained in a second

549
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:57,590
so the idea is we we then get

550
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,320
two the get delta l

551
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,270
is estimated

552
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:12,510
considering this ratio delta alpha delta h which is going to be approximately the same

553
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,420
the derivatives of l with respect to h

554
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:23,560
this is the thing that's easy because of course it's calculus

555
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,280
OK this is the easy part and that allows us to do something about the

556
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,700
real world

557
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,180
that's close by

558
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,300
over here

559
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,170
so the the reason why you should care about this quite a bit is that

560
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:39,420
it's it's used all the time to land airplanes

561
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,230
so you really do care that they actually know

562
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,020
two within a few feet or even closer

563
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,580
we're playing is and how high up it is and so forth

564
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:53,060
all right

565
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:57,090
so that that's it for the general introduction to what the derivative is i'm sure

566
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,150
you'll be getting used to this a lot of different contexts throughout the course

567
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,430
and now we have to get back down to

568
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,550
to some some

569
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,180
rigorous details

570
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,400
so everybody happy with what we've got so far

571
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:23,000
good question the question was how did i get this equation for height

572
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,380
i just

573
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:29,610
i made it up because it's the formula from physics

574
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,890
that you will learn when you take

575
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,730
in one

576
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,520
and it has to do with the fact that the in fact it has to

577
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,680
do with the fact that if you this is speed if you differentiate another time

578
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,940
yet acceleration and this is the acceleration due to gravity is ten meters per second

579
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,960
which happens to be the second derivative this but anyway i just pulled out of

580
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,880
the hat from your physics class

581
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,780
so you can just say

582
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,830
see know one

583
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,540
all right

584
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:07,260
other questions

585
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,580
right so let's let's go on now

586
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:13,850
now i have to be a little bit more systematic about limits

587
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,970
so let's see

588
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:24,790
let's do that now

589
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:28,450
so now i like to talk about is limit

590
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,220
and the continuity

591
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:41,350
this is a warm-up for deriving all the rest of the formulas

592
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,740
all the rest of the formulas and i'm going to need

593
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,060
to differentiate

594
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,780
every function you know remember that's our goal and we only have about a week

595
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,680
left so we better

596
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,180
let's start

597
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,930
so first of all

598
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,750
there's what i will call easy limit

599
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:05,280
so what's an easy limit

600
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,840
an easy limit is something like the limit

601
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,750
as x goes to o four

602
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,510
of x plus three over x squared plus one

603
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:21,510
with this kind of elements all have to do to evaluate it is to plug

604
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,500
so you can do this one at the time

605
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,820
no matter how the more these joint distributions are

606
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,540
you can take the

607
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,820
relative entropy but now the relative entropy condition

608
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,650
and that's my conditioning

609
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,120
it is so important when you

610
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,810
deal with any of these information measures so you take one

611
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:48,340
conditioned on all the others that you have already taken

612
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:54,980
OK so now let me go back to

613
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,860
and that intriguing

614
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:05,170
saying that the could glider divergence

615
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:11,750
the relative entropy generalizes shannon's definition of information

616
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,450
and winners information now let me just point out

617
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,150
now that i read these shannon's definition of information actually shadow

618
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:27,670
i mention that work in his paper in fact he did mention information theory

619
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:34,340
in in one place in his people but he never says anything about

620
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,660
this being a measure of information or never

621
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,760
even defines mutual information in his paper for one matter for of

622
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,850
for that matter

623
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,540
OK so

624
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,680
what both defined we know in china

625
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:56,320
who we have here in this picture

626
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,120
shall define the discrete entropy

627
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,760
and also these

628
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,850
what we call now differential entropy although he also calling entropy

629
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:13,810
winner also define these differential entropy about the same time also in nineteen forty eight

630
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,890
in the book

631
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:18,450
they became a big bestseller called cybernetics

632
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:26,070
and essentially winner the only the only reason he gave for defining it that way

633
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,540
was that OK for nine months

634
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,030
the told him that that thing was a good thing to look at

635
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:38,620
now this is from a from the next from a paper he wrote later

636
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,900
the shannon winner definition of quantity of information for it belongs to the two of

637
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,040
us equally

638
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:54,330
sharon was a little bit more circumspect circumspect about this definition

639
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:01,470
and then the mathematician that actually realise the first mathematician who realized that

640
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:09,000
what china had done was really revolutionary was andrey kolmogorov in the soviet union

641
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:17,230
and he he got it right and has no physical interpretation so

642
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,320
the first thing that one makes wine

643
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,190
or in you introduce this quantity is to take the logarithm of a probability density

644
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,440
and that's a big no-no

645
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:33,120
all right so when we took longer than up to now we always took longer

646
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,690
in terms of quantities that don't have

647
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,600
units so to speak

648
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,230
OK they were ratio of probabilities ratios of pts

649
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:48,240
or rather than weakening that even is in the most general case so you you

650
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,100
always have to think of the

651
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,170
of probability density functions as

652
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,400
being one over

653
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:00,890
meters or seconds or whatever your

654
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,570
you're underlying euclidean space means

655
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,720
so i

656
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,230
this is the kind of integral that should be

657
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,970
declared illegal

658
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,090
and the one that gives links to a lot of trouble

659
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,020
too many people that tend to use it

660
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:23,020
thinking that it satisfies the same properties as entropy

661
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,810
but then they run into trouble

662
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:29,950
why has this been so important in information theory

663
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:33,630
if you you could take the leading textbook in information theory

664
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,570
my comment almost to devote whole chapter to this well

665
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,230
essentially because

666
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,780
relative entropy

667
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,790
to come along time to get into information theory

668
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,030
even though

669
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:50,060
it was defined by collecting liebler only three years after short

670
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,610
it's been extremely slow

671
00:42:53,610 --> 00:43:00,270
in in getting into the toolbox of information theorist so

672
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,760
that avoid essentially was taken by these

673
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,870
differential entropy

674
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,470
right and the main reason is this formula

675
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,060
the entropy

676
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,860
actually if you take the

677
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,380
relative entropy of

678
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,500
a given distribution with given mean and variance and due take the relative entropy with

679
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:29,130
respect to the gaussians distribution we use the same mean and the same variants that

680
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,860
of course is going to give you

681
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,860
number that will gatehouse

682
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,670
no model that distribution is

683
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,360
is you can write it as a constant

684
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:45,040
minus the differential entropy of px

685
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,850
right so this this is really one the reason why

686
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,050
these differential entropy now

687
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:54,350
important because this is important

688
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,090
and of course

689
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:01,000
it also says that this is what the winner

690
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,810
show the same time as shown

691
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,480
that among all distributions that have the same

692
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:15,530
the gaussians is the one that has the largest differential entropy

693
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,770
and that also

694
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:25,840
explains the rationale for the maximum entropy principle that again is quite

695
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:32,860
quite common in applications where OK we don't have enough information to say what

696
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,770
i distribution is

697
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:36,690
so we have some

698
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,900
information may be about the

699
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,060
the second moment of distribution

700
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:50,000
from observations and then we would like to actually from the bootstrap distribution so

701
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,670
a typical thing to do is you we say well

702
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:55,320
right and you can actually move these things that

703
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:55,850
and then look at

704
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,160
effects of

705
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,530
what that strategy does

706
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:02,400
now notice what's happening in the business user

707
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:06,140
we one of these programs moving around the dashboard

708
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:10,620
that result in an of operational strategy for

709
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,810
so it might say one

710
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:15,760
the very

711
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,700
i want to offer them nothing let him go

712
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:23,200
that would be in the room

713
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,760
because just like

714
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,910
it's not even more so the

715
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,590
now but could be also very

716
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,440
high value customers but the point is

717
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:38,080
you're moving along axes that was acquired in one right it's personal

718
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,210
just like i just left

719
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,980
this is just like

720
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:47,970
imagine things like engineering students have a very low value today they have very high

721
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:50,270
value euro two

722
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:55,660
by the probability of challenges again predict that this is a great example

723
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,410
embedded data mining

724
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:01,020
he doesn't even know what's happening in the background that is happening the background it's

725
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,570
working directly to solve this problem

726
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,000
you can do the same for banks you know we extend this to make it

727
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:11,840
the banks and so forth

728
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:13,800
going to city

729
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,430
the domain knowledge we all know data mining algorithms

730
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,510
pretty stupid

731
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,520
so much about

732
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,430
so how do you make them smaller

733
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:28,990
at the time trying to make more

734
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:33,670
is any i complete problems so you can engage in a project for ten twenty

735
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,470
years and that's all

736
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,090
or you can solve it very very well

737
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,630
that is the way

738
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:44,240
is by solving a very narrow problem where actually there is no more about the

739
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,760
then the human being with

740
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:50,600
here's an example of use

741
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:55,230
it's the case study from the mining DMX group

742
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,750
is process of selling right recommendation systems

743
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,980
so let's say this is actually what we do not

744
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,250
some of these people are

745
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,300
and they're on your site

746
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:12,340
and trying to evaluate different is aspects

747
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:15,460
if you follow statistics statistics value

748
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,530
and know much about this customers predicting

749
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,840
so something common access like about

750
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,390
what i don't know

751
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:30,080
is that first of all i was trying to decide

752
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,480
but i think the show is that

753
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,280
sounds very simple to

754
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,720
but not

755
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,410
because the

756
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,010
statistics say that there is probably more than the it's

757
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:43,710
they sure

758
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,770
they could be an upset be down depending on the strategies business because they want

759
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:49,510
to be

760
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:54,520
just spitting image that they want they don't sound just expensive stuff

761
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:57,230
that's a customer was

762
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,000
what's the best of the best

763
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,570
what is the statistics statistically based algorithm

764
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:08,610
statistics for i know this customer it's all about us

765
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,490
so much more

766
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:14,010
that's the worst thing you can do

767
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,430
because if you just

768
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:21,690
selected pants show another start asking yourself what was wrong with my choice is the

769
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,470
the wrong color maybe sort model them we think about the next thing you know

770
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:28,090
you're the best continually

771
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,520
but i think show the things that go along

772
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:33,600
so you get surfaces statistics

773
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,570
it's just another set of statistics that condition something different

774
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,010
even though the numbers

775
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:46,990
there are also sorts some contractual things you have to worry about here so

776
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,990
actually if you can show

777
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:55,020
shirts from different from competitor there's all sorts of things that you never think about

778
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,590
the phenomenon

779
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:01,380
and of course that when the checkout that's when you do that your statistics you're

780
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,380
imposed by

781
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:06,060
let me see if i can just pop the basket something

782
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:08,150
now what is different here

783
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,480
there's two things more mining and i challenge you to

784
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:17,370
one is the knowledge of these products for all these products are related to each

785
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,220
and two

786
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,580
business constraints

787
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:25,940
those more important and so is all the statistics you can go about this is

788
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,330
pragmatic grand for managing and maintaining models

789
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:35,340
channel five minutes here

790
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:38,970
this is a big deal

791
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:43,980
we spend a lot of energy trying to come up with new data mining models

792
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,840
what happens when you produce

793
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,030
what happens when six months old

794
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:53,300
what happens when you actually visit data generated is no longer there

795
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,660
how do you updated

796
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,410
i do maintain

797
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,140
i think data

798
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:03,650
dropping behind when you do the secession

799
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:07,700
i come back to you later tried to reverse engineer what

800
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:12,400
israeli israel palestinians obviously but i mean the stuff

801
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:19,400
the despondency about russian zyuganov are

802
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:25,600
what's the what's up this was still the war in yugoslavia and pedal hostage

803
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:30,340
crisis in peru if you remember from ninety five so this was the small cluster

804
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,590
it is one way how to present this high-level structure of such a collection then

805
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,080
if you would do mean then

806
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:43,150
so would get a little bit finer structure

807
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:47,700
this is about seems so it just seems instance

808
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,000
OK so this is one

809
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,540
quite classical way of

810
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,550
visualizing text

811
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:57,880
this team is also home

812
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:02,890
this picture in particular is very popular because it appears most of the books for

813
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,630
this is

814
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:08,060
probably it was most one many made the time

815
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:13,990
so this is analysis of castro speeches from nineteen sixty

816
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:17,710
two nineteen sixty one and so

817
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:23,660
so he had serious speeches and in different species he was using different vocabulary different

818
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:29,330
words and i think that this was then manually categorise and visualize how the frequency

819
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:36,310
of certain certain words is changing and then this was kind of

820
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,810
indicator that

821
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:44,610
certain thoughts were going on his hat and some of the things he was known

822
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:49,540
that he was not able to to be silent this is kind of musician how

823
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:56,000
to reverse engineer such information from some this species

824
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:04,130
types of physicians so this is critical dot com which some of you might know

825
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:06,730
so this is a visualisation of search results

826
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:10,580
so i a

827
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:14,350
around this i this

828
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:22,230
good work

829
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:28,130
so let's see if you type in

830
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:33,460
data mining

831
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:39,560
basically it performs just clustering or the result set

832
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,330
probably the using some

833
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,730
on the back end

834
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:53,690
we visualize the results that can connect to the most relevant clusters so

835
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,560
one of these methods which

836
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:59,810
mentioned before just nicely visualized flesh

837
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:05,630
and this will be also some kind of categorization topics

838
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,540
so this is one possible way

839
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:12,730
the other visualisation of

840
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,980
of search results is this site which

841
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,040
developed by

842
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,670
our guys which i shall now

843
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:26,130
which is also

844
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:30,710
see into sink so it's

845
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:39,210
this is temporary sites but so it appears likeable guy but actually it's not just

846
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,150
our proximity now

847
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:46,630
but if you type in the query so

848
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,520
and search

849
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:54,710
and we would get normal will results plus something here on the right

850
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,650
and what it happens so

851
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:00,980
again this our proxy takes all the

852
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,330
it performs clustering identifies

853
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:11,460
the main keywords so opera web services and object and now

854
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,330
and this is the region of all

855
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,230
well this rank

856
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:17,170
now if we move this

857
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,520
red dot

858
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,940
sorry let's say opera

859
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:36,190
ranking will change and it would be more like close to this concept of operations

860
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:40,480
of the soap opera of here would get all the hits which are related to

861
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,610
soap opera well let's see if you would move this two

862
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:45,360
something else this

863
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:51,130
happened is i think the general character of the slam problem as a graph estimation

864
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,700
problem is now very well understood i mean it now seems kind of so obvious

865
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,700
that you wonder why we didn't quite realize this

866
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:02,980
fifteen years ago but we did with resistor problem we applied the camel filter to

867
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:06,730
but of course the kalman filter is just one example of an algorithm of

868
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,920
solving you know the general

869
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:14,570
graph of the variables that you're interested in this learning problem so in this particular graph

870
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,340
yes the problems that the variables you want estimates are

871
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:19,460
the historical

872
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:24,580
positions of the camera or robot that moves through the world these are the axis here

873
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:30,030
hand the positions of these landmarks were able to observe in the world these otherwise

874
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:34,120
we can't directly observe is what we can observe these image measurements

875
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:37,630
so each of these image measurements is for instance the image position

876
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,420
of one image feature that we match an image

877
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,550
it depends on one position of the camera

878
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,340
and one landmark

879
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,860
so these are the things we want we have to

880
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:50,710
basically do inference on the on the grafters to solve for the x

881
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,000
otherwise so once you understand the more you know the general character of this problem

882
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,530
you realize this other algorithms that can filter

883
00:55:59,160 --> 00:55:59,620
that you can

884
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,830
use and some of them have figured

885
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:03,300
big advantages

886
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:06,070
some something

887
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:12,250
useful ways when in two thousand seven climb produced a system called a

888
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:15,050
peter which basically cells exactly the same problem

889
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:18,890
has monitor land but does it much better than particularly

890
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,670
doesn't better because they were able to uh

891
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,630
build massive

892
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,470
i have thousands of features rather than

893
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,500
a few dozens or hundreds which is so we were able to do

894
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,390
and they are able to do that's by basically solving

895
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,680
this graph problem in in a slightly different way basically bringing in

896
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,470
what was previously an offline technique bundle adjustment

897
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:41,970
which is basically the

898
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,510
you know the global

899
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,280
the least squares solution to to these kind of

900
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:52,380
they did what they were doing is taking an ever growing network like this and

901
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:55,890
always solving it from scratch on every frame it had to be clever and now

902
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,530
they were leach choosing which in the past data to keep

903
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,030
which in the past data throw away

904
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,230
but by some careful management and then of course

905
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,370
more computer power that led to run

906
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:10,180
bundle adjustment in real time on the second thread

907
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:12,320
then they were able to get really good

908
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,310
results in this peter system

909
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:20,310
we really took back on board

910
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:21,480
first all we

911
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,800
did a piece work to figure out why

912
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:25,360
he time which really

913
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,740
better than that of the kalman filtering

914
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,660
methods that we were previously using

915
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:35,510
hand we were able to prove it to ourselves it with with this kind of analysis so

916
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:36,700
this was an

917
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,520
experiment that we actually did in simulation so

918
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,490
imagine you've got a camera

919
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,060
which is just moving

920
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,510
for half a second

921
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,070
so during that time captures fifteen frames

922
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,150
in front and there is a scene where you can potentially measure

923
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,830
a lot of features so potentially this four hundred

924
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,120
features that can make

925
00:57:56,990 --> 00:58:00,350
measurements of one on the wall in front so if you want to estimate the

926
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:03,840
motion between here and here the best possible way to do is to take holidays

927
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:08,820
take all of the feature measurements in all the frames all the correspondences

928
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:13,050
bundle adjust the whole lot of offline expensive but gives you a good

929
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,310
a good solution

930
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:17,400
so the question was what happens to a good solution

931
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:18,900
if we start

932
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,090
kind of taking away the data so festival we can remove

933
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,110
the number of intermediate frames

934
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:26,350
that we use

935
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,590
andy other thing we can do is reduce the number of points

936
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,080
thatwe use

937
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,580
so this is a graph basically showing

938
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,410
accuracy so high

939
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,700
is good here

940
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:41,120
so this maximum point of using all of the frames so up to fifteen frames here

941
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:43,050
and using all of the points

942
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:44,640
we get really good

943
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:48,120
as we start to degrade the number of frames

944
00:58:48,930 --> 00:58:50,570
and the number of points you accuracy

945
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,620
reduces but the interesting thing is

946
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:59,100
when you degrade the number of intermediate frames that use it it doesn't degrade very much at all

947
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:05,310
and you can do statistical studies done statistical studies show that this is the same

948
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:09,990
i really HAK i

949
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,620
all you

950
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:17,640
each day i

951
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,120
people to

952
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,450
and each one of k

953
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:28,680
what i times each two

954
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:32,620
he two hash functions

955
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:38,250
two hash functions h

956
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,200
one of k and h two with k

957
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,750
as you compute the two hash functions

958
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:49,520
and what you do is you start by just using each one of k

959
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,830
the zero progress here i then

960
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,390
will be zero

961
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,060
and for the

962
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,120
the first for the

963
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,230
probe number one

964
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,220
just at each

965
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:07,680
the problem true just add that hash function amount again

966
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:11,790
just keep adding each to OK three success passion

967
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:13,790
six f approach me

968
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:17,370
so it's very easy to compute two hash functions of france

969
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:20,180
there you can delay the second one case

970
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:25,560
basically computer and then you just keep adding the second one is started the location

971
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,250
the first one batting second one

972
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:29,450
what am

973
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:31,330
to determine your

974
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,850
so this is an excellent method

975
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:43,490
there's a fine job and usually pick

976
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:49,540
the power to here

977
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:52,470
basically you're using a

978
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,850
usually people use this with the multiplication method for example

979
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,640
and part two

980
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:05,490
h two of a forced to be odd

981
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,850
so you use and even values there because otherwise you

982
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:12,410
for any particular use skipping over

983
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,350
once again we have the problem that everything could be even or everything could be

984
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:17,520
you're going through

985
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,200
to make it two k lot enemies

986
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,310
power two

987
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:26,020
they're guaranteed that every slot

988
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:38,160
OK so let's analyse this this turns out to be pretty interesting and analyse

989
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:45,750
so once again the worst case

990
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:47,390
you know

991
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:49,250
caching is lousy

992
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:53,160
over-analyze average

993
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:08,310
this we need a little bit stronger assumptions

994
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:13,390
chaining and we call consumption

995
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:18,770
uniform hashing

996
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:24,200
which says that HP

997
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:31,620
equally likely

998
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:37,970
you have

999
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:56,490
as its probe sequence

1000
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:07,850
of other keys

1001
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:16,430
and there were approved

1002
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:27,910
is the expected number of probes

1003
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:29,850
is most

1004
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:33,990
one myself

1005
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:36,620
if alpha is less

1006
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:50,350
number keys on the table is less than the number of slots

1007
01:03:50,370 --> 01:04:03,520
thanks for and shows the number of probes is one of one myself

1008
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,520
alpha load factor

1009
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:10,500
for open addressing we want to load factor

1010
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,500
to be less than one

1011
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:17,990
as we have more keys than slots open addressing simply doesn't work

1012
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,080
because you're going to find a place for every t in the table

1013
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:30,620
look at unsuccessful search

1014
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:42,430
the first thing is that one protein is always necessary

1015
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,290
so i have

1016
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:57,620
and over

1017
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,640
sorry if i have in

1018
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:04,680
items stored in slots

1019
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:09,520
what's the probability that one idea is that probo again collision with something that's already

1020
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:13,970
in the table

1021
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:16,950
what's the probability that i get the collision

1022
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:25,430
n or m right so probability

1023
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:28,140
and over and

1024
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:38,270
my tables got things in their and hashing random talk one of them

1025
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:44,140
what i'd like something and overran

1026
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:50,100
and then the second probe is necessary

1027
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:56,540
so that

1028
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:58,130
i do second proto

1029
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,990
with probability

1030
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,460
on the second from do i get the collision

1031
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:08,470
to make the assumption of uniform hashing each

1032
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:11,790
is equally likely to any one of the n factorial

1033
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,750
permutations of the probe sequence

1034
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:19,090
what is the probability that on the second proto

1035
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:39,060
i get equation

1036
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:48,020
this the permutation you're not right

1037
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:53,560
something like that

1038
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:57,460
song we've seen that before i call that the distance from the sun to the

1039
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:01,950
is about one hundred fifty million kilometres

1040
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:03,050
forgive me for

1041
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,410
mixing up meters

1042
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,340
this kilometres but you have to convert that of course two meters

1043
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:09,110
and when you calculate

1044
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,920
how long it takes earth to go around the sun

1045
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:13,240
no surprise

1046
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:16,660
you'll find three hundred and sixty

1047
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:18,320
five and a half days

1048
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,120
simply substitution

1049
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:22,000
of these two quantities

1050
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,820
the equation that i have here

1051
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:29,110
and i have here

1052
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,320
the velocity of the earth

1053
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,610
you know if it is about thirty

1054
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:36,860
kilometres per second

1055
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:40,640
substantial speed by the way to do this is going around the

1056
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:44,420
some thirty kilometres per second way higher than the speed

1057
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,220
that the shuttle

1058
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:50,680
is it around the orbit around the earth which is only eight kilometres

1059
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,560
the second

1060
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,370
jupiter is five

1061
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,460
times further away than the earth

1062
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,350
so the time for me to go around goes was

1063
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,440
five to the power one and a half

1064
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:03,200
that's about

1065
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,070
twelve so take stupid about twelve years ago

1066
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,390
the sun

1067
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:09,760
notice that this

1068
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:12,360
is independent

1069
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:14,680
of the mass of the little satellite

1070
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:15,880
and that was

1071
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:17,360
very unfortunate

1072
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:19,420
forty americans when

1073
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:20,660
on october

1074
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:23,860
before nineteen fifty seven sputnik was launched

1075
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:27,390
they could find the radius very easily because they knew

1076
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:28,340
the period

1077
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:32,480
that it took sputnik to go around the earth that what about ninety six minutes

1078
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:36,620
they could calculate the velocity they could calculate the radius but they had no clue

1079
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:37,830
about the map

1080
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:40,550
that was a piece of degree

1081
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:45,180
the americans wanted to because if the mass was very large of sputnik that would

1082
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:49,040
indicate of course that the russians had very powerful rockets

1083
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,730
you cannot tell

1084
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:51,510
the mass

1085
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:52,500
from the

1086
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:58,790
orbital parameters independent of mass you have a very light object or very heavy satellite

1087
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:02,310
they have the same velocity in orbit if they have the same distance and they

1088
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:03,240
have the same

1089
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,290
i mentioned earlier notice that the orbital

1090
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,480
period and escape

1091
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:17,190
very by the square root of two if you're at a particular position

1092
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,270
for instance

1093
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:19,720
you have a particular

1094
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:21,820
position around the earth

1095
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,550
you the satellite

1096
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,020
if you want to escape

1097
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:25,860
from this

1098
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:29,460
you will need a speech which is the square root of two times larger than

1099
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:31,460
that orbital velocity

1100
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:33,210
and so if you wanted to

1101
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,990
from the earth

1102
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,140
then you need your eleven point two kilometres

1103
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,220
we have there

1104
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:44,570
if you and the earth in orbit u eight kilometres per second and eight times

1105
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:46,710
the square root of two is exactly

1106
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:50,940
eleven point two you see the connection is always through this square root

1107
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,730
of two

1108
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,670
there's something remarkable about these numbers

1109
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:59,940
total mechanical energy

1110
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:02,250
and i will write once more here

1111
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:05,520
which is one half

1112
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:08,070
the square at a given

1113
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:10,370
radius minus little

1114
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,220
capital and

1115
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,940
of are where m is

1116
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:18,840
the mass of the sun or the earth is of no concern to me now

1117
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:22,940
this is the kinetic energy for something in orbit at this rate is and this

1118
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,870
is the potential energy

1119
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,060
now notice

1120
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:27,840
i can substitute now

1121
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,820
forty three squared

1122
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:32,720
i can substitute the square of this

1123
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,600
this is the that is the orbital

1124
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,680
speed and then i get

1125
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:39,230
g over are

1126
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:41,140
and so this one

1127
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,640
was one half

1128
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:45,420
and and j

1129
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:48,260
and now compared to

1130
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:51,190
almost look like carbon copies of each other

1131
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:54,190
except that there is a minus sign which is crucial

1132
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:57,300
and there's a half half-year year which is missing here

1133
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,740
and so the total energy e

1134
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,870
which i called the mechanical energy

1135
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,360
always for a circular orbit is one half you

1136
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:07,640
and the same

1137
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,050
as minors

1138
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:10,960
the kinetic energy

1139
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,250
a remarkable

1140
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:16,750
coincidence you would think it is not as much a coincidence as you think of

1141
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:22,060
the difference if something is in orbit is the orbital speeds

1142
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:23,670
the radius r

1143
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,930
and always is its total energy

1144
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:26,910
is half

1145
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,510
potential energy is always negative

1146
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:32,950
OK later in the course we will cover elliptical orbits i will not do that

1147
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:36,600
today and so i will march on to a completely different topic

1148
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,360
and that is the topic of

1149
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:40,520
power so i will abandon for now

1150
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:44,750
orbit entirely

1151
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:46,740
what is power

1152
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:51,460
is work

1153
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:54,140
that is

1154
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:58,870
so the amount of time

1155
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,020
the the WDTFW is the

1156
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,060
the work

1157
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:05,370
is the instantaneous power

1158
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:09,350
at time t

1159
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:12,890
we also know power in terms of political power

1160
01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:14,590
that's very different

1161
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:16,050
political power

1162
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,770
you can do no work at all in a lot of time

1163
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,790
you have a lot of power

1164
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,330
here in physics

1165
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:24,850
life is not that easy

1166
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,210
units of power

1167
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:30,270
are units of work which is due for second

1168
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,760
but which we often write w

1169
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:37,540
which is named after physicist what's don't confuse this w for work

1170
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:39,190
with the w for what

1171
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,560
which is one ju

1172
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,950
per second

1173
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:44,860
the work

1174
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,170
that i do that the force is doing

1175
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:49,010
is the dot product

1176
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:53,580
between the fourth and certain displacement of that

1177
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:54,620
force we have

1178
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,140
dealt with that before

1179
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:56,980
that is

1180
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:58,170
a little bit

1181
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:59,610
of work that i'm doing

1182
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:04,320
i have force which is constant during this short small displacement

1183
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,390
so i can substitute then in there

1184
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:08,440
and so i get the power

1185
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,790
is the derivative of this was time

1186
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:16,370
and that is if i keep the force constant for that short amount of time

1187
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:17,720
is the dot product

1188
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,310
times the velocity because the dt

1189
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:24,890
is simply the velocity of that object

1190
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:27,110
so power is also force

1191
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,640
but it with the

1192
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:31,720
velocity if the force were perpendicular

1193
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,110
at all times

1194
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:33,910
to the

1195
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,320
velocity vector

1196
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:39,790
the power is zero

1197
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,440
let's take an example

1198
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:44,360
i am on a bicycle

1199
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,850
here's my bicycle

1200
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:50,310
and i'm sitting on a bicycle here

1201
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,430
and i'm trying to

1202
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,630
and i have a certain

1203
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:58,270
and i keep that velocity

1204
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,320
that's the way most people

1205
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:03,460
i would write their bikes

1206
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,340
there an drag which is unavoidable

1207
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:08,830
we discuss that

1208
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:13,800
more on that but the basic idea is that you get full control of machine

1209
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,240
and it all links server is not a web service

1210
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,600
when their Web service story here is that we use Web services as an administrative

1211
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:27,370
interface to control the servers so that you're able to start and stop servers and

1212
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:29,390
to make certain that are still running

1213
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:33,060
so you can basically people use these with bottom and use this Web servers interface

1214
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:38,870
with automation to control server products not talk more about that there are more and

1215
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,800
there's no I once again there's no up-front Costa anything so

1216
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:46,740
In the case of 30 due to that server recharged by 10 cents US per

1217
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:52,970
hour to run and there's enough momentum or anything plus the same band bandwidth charges

1218
01:14:52,970 --> 01:14:55,260
that we charge for an entire history

1219
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:56,700
so it's

1220
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:03,080
really I changed the the price equation for computing versus the way that I like

1221
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,190
to explain how this works with automation

1222
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:10,360
so nearly whether to project a start of we start with some sort of a

1223
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:15,170
prediction in or nearly the way we make predictions something like this hopefully you're prediction

1224
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:20,410
more like this than just a straight line but pointed to start production and then

1225
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:22,330
typically what we do is we go wild

1226
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,580
and by servers to stay above that that

1227
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:31,190
predicted projection because that's the idea with the prediction the start need nominee searched about

1228
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:36,560
what the problem with this approach is that this is really nasty thing it's called

1229
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:41,450
In reality never looks like the best line notebooks looks

1230
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:47,080
some other random and that has to be very real costs the 1st task is

1231
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:51,140
an opportunity this is sort of like an airline seat that simply you paid for

1232
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:55,970
it but you didn't village in so you lost that and there is a real

1233
01:15:55,970 --> 01:16:00,450
cost of course in the 2nd thoughts that most of us worry about witches you

1234
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:04,780
didn't have enough capacity in the user had a bad experience in if you're com

1235
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:08,650
they went away and never come back in a bid to project you'll hear about

1236
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:16,870
so neither of those so what's happening is by using Web services and monitoring the

1237
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:22,340
server to to find out you track whatever you want see CPU utilization requests for

1238
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:24,780
2nd on the network our we want to go

1239
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:30,240
you track attract servers tuna fleet of servers as you go

1240
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:34,410
In so doing you have what amounts to just-in-time capacity

1241
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:38,760
and I think it looks like an infant pooled servers out there from your point

1242
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:43,170
of view of course it's not but it's also big might as well be from

1243
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:48,910
any individual organizations point to and its civil division just-in-time capacity

1244
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:54,890
so we have if you think about how virtual server works there is at the

1245
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:56,190
end of the day

1246
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:58,500
a virtual server is always a file

1247
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,600
he was represented by a file so there's

1248
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:06,340
3 different kinds of Amazon machine images which reduce file representations that I want to

1249
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:09,340
spend just a 2nd talking about 1st of all

1250
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:12,320
there's a public mine which if I can get things working here

1251
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:16,740
I'll show you in the doubles and publicly inquiry basically an I that's out there

1252
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:21,350
on our site there that we've made available 1 of the hundreds that our community

1253
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:26,170
is made available in the contains you know some distribution of Linux with some of

1254
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:30,060
its offer was installed on top of that you're able to run

1255
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:33,670
where a lot of people don't really need a private and my with yourself around

1256
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:35,890
you can do you can create that either

1257
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:40,070
customizing public in mind sitting at a starting with an image on your machine and

1258
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:45,430
uploading it to to our service and that's stored in your own history account Amazon

1259
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:46,760
history accounts

1260
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,800
he and

1261
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:51,780
only you have access to it that's what probably most people would run

1262
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:54,950
but there's a certain pattern that I want to talk about because I think that

1263
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:59,320
this is a real business opportunities for almost in a year and it's kind of

1264
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:03,410
a new business opportunities it's sort of software as a service

1265
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:09,340
I like the cult's offers and nobody another reason I'm going to and what up

1266
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:13,210
in my is all about ideas for example in the case of easy to but

1267
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:18,450
say that you add some software to win imaging you wanna resellers

1268
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:22,240
a CRM package that you installed on top of the support on top of the

1269
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:26,600
image or something like that which you can do it you set your own price

1270
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:30,410
for a new make it available on Amazon . com

1271
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:34,760
purchase for argument sake let's say that we added at 20 cents and costly church

1272
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:37,610
and so what happens is people

1273
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:41,870
visit the Amazon . com website variable signed up for the public or the stadium

1274
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:43,340
it was going to do

1275
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,630
going to

1276
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:53,730
it's going to be again approach in which we must realise over the sources too

1277
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:56,420
classes and properties over the ontology

1278
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:59,370
OK so that's what we're going to do OK

1279
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:03,680
but we not that because we have to deal also with the fact that they

1280
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,900
can the sources is now the population

1281
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:11,840
we have only by its own auction OK while

1282
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:13,810
in the ontology as we know

1283
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:19,300
we have both objects by in particular the eastern system the classes

1284
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:26,770
OK so we need to solve the so-called impedance mismatch problem

1285
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:31,210
so let's look at this problem a little bit

1286
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:35,020
so the problem is the in relational database we have by

1287
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:39,760
in ontologies we have both object and by OK and in fact i just played

1288
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,860
the main villain

1289
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:42,800
OK survives only use

1290
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:49,310
a few letters for objects active told that the property OK

1291
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:51,800
so the point is there

1292
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:56,610
we have to take out of top also values we have to create

1293
01:19:57,690 --> 01:20:00,350
OK we took it out so the point is that we have

1294
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:04,340
we need to have constant dollars create objects

1295
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:06,390
from the couple of months

1296
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:11,340
in the actually

1297
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:15,860
there is a very nice thing however that you should have been the ontology

1298
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:19,340
after this so we don't really care

1299
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:21,320
what is the shape

1300
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:25,260
it's a fact which are going to do in this is the part of the

1301
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:28,480
part of the formal solution is that we can consider this

1302
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:35,710
simply skolem function with that's colin functions these functions that are not interpreted

1303
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,290
OK so what i do i take it up

1304
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:43,440
i consider is an argument over skolem function and i don't need to give an

1305
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:47,870
interpretation to this kind of functions the infection said to the new generated in this

1306
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:48,930
way is really

1307
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:50,660
meaningful enough

1308
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,420
to be

1309
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,100
the object identifier

1310
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:58,810
all of a the instance of the class over the property that i'm interested in

1311
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:04,390
OK so this is how we do it mathematically i think i'll skip this

1312
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,730
and this is now

1313
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:13,020
the mapping is generated so essentially we have

1314
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:14,520
this part of the here

1315
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:15,420
these are

1316
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:19,640
and i think it's quite clearly over the sources OK

1317
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,010
in this returns some

1318
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:27,390
OK these are the values in this five is now use

1319
01:21:28,290 --> 01:21:29,670
in the real

1320
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:35,670
OK over the a of the ontology and how use the weight on the one

1321
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:41,620
in use that i can on getting uses argument skolem function to generate

1322
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:43,870
object to generate abstract objects

1323
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:48,150
and let me tell you that this over here

1324
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:50,140
OK it's not clear why this

1325
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:53,660
this is the first of that we this is a conjunction with you but we

1326
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:58,010
don't distinguish viable and actually this means that we have be in

1327
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:02,920
they got thinking and not in the last eighteen because we are the simplest kind

1328
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,770
of conjunctive queries

1329
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:07,010
OK so let me go

1330
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,640
at this point i would like to show

1331
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,590
that some

1332
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:16,050
a mapping from we also

1333
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:19,930
now what we do is we take essentially the

1334
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:23,010
the ontology they have been used so far in this tutorial

1335
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,870
we follow a b a box

1336
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:32,240
and instead of using a a synthetic data from this but going to try

1337
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:38,130
to connected to real database in particular this is a database that is using your

1338
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,430
relational database OK

1339
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:44,620
if you if your data for instance is is larger than fits in memory

1340
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:47,840
in your computer then you're in trouble

1341
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:51,110
so what i'll talk about today

1342
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,780
is the trick to speed this up

1343
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:55,570
and the trick is simply

1344
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:00,360
instead of waiting for all the data before we start the optimisation

1345
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:04,280
what we do is we just look at some of the data

1346
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,500
and that some

1347
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,110
of the data that could be like a single data point or it could be

1348
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:14,030
five data points or it could be a thousand data points that's that's the parameter

1349
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:15,490
that i can choose

1350
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:21,070
but i only look at some sort of sense of current observations a look at

1351
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:27,010
the current batch of observations then performing optimisation step on that then i grab some

1352
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:33,250
new observations optimise on that and i keep going like that this is called stochastic

1353
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:46,440
and what was so what we approximating is this function

1354
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:57,530
and we approximating it stochastically by stochastic is and this sub sampling of the data

1355
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:59,350
because when you try to model

1356
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:03,150
i analytically what's going on there the the assumption that you make is that your

1357
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:10,610
data is sort of i i d it's it's identically independently distributed and you're picking

1358
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,010
random data

1359
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:15,480
in practice of course that's not what you do you pick the data that you

1360
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:20,630
have at the moment so typically say if you have an online learning system where

1361
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:24,590
data comes in all the time and you try to adapt to that

1362
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:26,350
you don't have the

1363
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:29,660
the choice of picking your samples i i d

1364
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:32,150
because you just have to take what's there

1365
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:36,570
none the less sort of the label that's been attached to this

1366
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,130
these techniques

1367
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:41,510
on why is it an approximation

1368
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:46,020
well if my parameters theta would be constant

1369
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:50,870
then actually it would be exact right i could just take subsamples

1370
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:55,100
and if i then go and add up all the subsamples or of the gradients

1371
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,550
of the subsamples i would

1372
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:02,070
the original function of the original gradient back

1373
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:05,990
but that's not what i'm doing i'm taking a subsample

1374
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,770
and then i'm doing my optimisations

1375
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:12,710
and the optimizer changes the parameter vector because

1376
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,640
i'm searching in parameter space

1377
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:21,510
so now what adding up over time is actually slightly inconsistent because it's all these

1378
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:23,060
gradient measurements

1379
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:28,130
done on different data and slightly different parameter values

1380
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:33,740
and i'm going to pretend that overall that corresponds to some sort of gradient of

1381
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:35,620
the entire objective function

1382
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:40,290
people have done analysis on that and derive conditions under which that works

1383
01:25:48,690 --> 01:25:49,760
so they

1384
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:07,640
nothing to do is is too strong but you are very right in pointing out

1385
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:10,530
that the problem that's exactly the problem

1386
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:18,170
the upshot of all of that is that you don't want to do too much

1387
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:22,070
on this little sample of data

1388
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:26,650
because yes it's poor information you only have some of the data not all of

1389
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:31,160
it and so you don't want to expend huge effort for instance and do like

1390
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:37,230
you know gauss newton are living but mark warner whatever optimisation step

1391
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:40,900
because the minimum that you find in that step actually has very little to do

1392
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:44,090
with whether true minimum it's that's true

1393
01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:49,890
and that's why i'm interested in these kinds of methods because these are cheaper and

1394
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:52,560
less efficient optimisation methods

1395
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:56,500
and it turns out that if on this small data sample you just do a

1396
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,810
little step in the right direction

1397
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:04,580
and you keep doing that for fresh samples over time if you set this up

1398
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:08,750
in the right way it will actually converge to the right answer

1399
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:14,420
so yes you can't be too over-aggressive in optimizing on this small subsamples that's part

1400
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:15,610
of the

1401
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:18,310
part of the the game here

1402
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:29,820
there's various scenarios so

1403
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:35,540
one scenario would call online learning

1404
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:38,020
where the better just keeps coming in

1405
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:41,880
so you never see the same data twice because it's just i don't know you

1406
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:45,820
have a video feed you know you're trying to learn from that as it goes

1407
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:48,260
but there's always fresh images coming

1408
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:52,510
so you never recycle that data that's online learning

1409
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:58,100
in that scenario you actually have to use a stochastic approximation because you cannot wait

1410
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:00,040
for the end of the training data

1411
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:04,040
before the end of this this loop because there's no and

1412
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:10,790
however it turns out stochastic approximation algorithms can be very efficient optimizers so people use

1413
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:13,830
them even when the training set is finite

1414
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:15,990
and what you would typically do

1415
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:20,240
is you say you have your training set

1416
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,070
let's say each of these vectors is one

1417
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:26,990
and they keep coming

1418
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:29,730
and this year set right

1419
01:28:29,730 --> 01:28:31,990
becomes more important

1420
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,350
so two things about it in our vascular systems the flow rates are generally low

1421
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:38,420
enough that you have to worry about that

1422
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:40,760
and are are

1423
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:42,530
are vessels are all

1424
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:47,010
very similar in terms of their of their

1425
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:53,320
microscopic geometry and that all of the blood vessels are are covered with a monolayer

1426
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,180
of cells called endothelial cells

1427
01:28:56,220 --> 01:29:02,200
the basically former blanket over the entire surface of the inside of the circulatory system

1428
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:03,450
so there is very little

1429
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:05,340
frictional resistance to flow

1430
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,390
there better

1431
01:29:06,410 --> 01:29:10,580
it's really the point

1432
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,920
the questions

1433
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:17,280
so this this equation sort of makes sense right well if you if you go

1434
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:23,100
on to study biomedical engineering you learn exactly where this equation comes from and you'd

1435
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:28,470
be able to derive it yourself but but for now just accepted

1436
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:33,050
and if it is true for almost all the vessels in our body almost under

1437
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:39,570
all the circumstances of human physiology and it tells us that resistance varies with viscosity

1438
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:43,530
link and radius and if there is in in in in kind of the

1439
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:48,940
the way that you would expect as discussed fluid goes up resistance goes up

1440
01:29:48,990 --> 01:29:52,430
as the length of the two goes up resistance goes up

1441
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:56,090
right harder to pull through long strada through a short stroll

1442
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,890
and as the radius goes up

1443
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:01,190
resistance goes down

1444
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,210
right because the radius is in the

1445
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:04,380
it is in the

1446
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:10,220
denominator here so radius goes up the resistance goes down and remarkably

1447
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:15,960
the resistance goes with the fourth power of the radius

1448
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,410
what does that mean

1449
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:23,930
that means the fold increase in radius leads to a sixteen fold reduction

1450
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,370
sixteen is two to the fourth round

1451
01:30:26,410 --> 01:30:28,920
sixteen fold reduction in

1452
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:37,940
so resistances of all the parameters resistance is most sensitive to radius

1453
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:39,030
when you have

1454
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:48,890
so what's the unit was let's think about what unit would you

1455
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:51,970
would you measure pressure and

1456
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:55,690
what's the unit of pressure

1457
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:59,910
that scales is one

1458
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:06,530
newtons per meter square millimetres square to force per area

1459
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:09,750
is pressure

1460
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:13,290
this is what some more commonly those are those are

1461
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:17,790
those are the those are great units sorry

1462
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:21,620
pounds per square inch is another unit PSI

1463
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:24,910
what's the pressure in the room here

1464
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:29,910
one atmosphere atmosphere is another pressures on their relative to atmospheric pressure

1465
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,900
if you have

1466
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,680
many many others

1467
01:31:36,730 --> 01:31:42,890
millimetres of mercury it turns out that all of those are are are proper units

1468
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:46,410
four pressure and you can convert between one or the other as long as you

1469
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:49,050
knew what the conversion factor was between the

1470
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:56,320
we usually use atmospheres to describe atmospheric pressure physiologist usually use millimetres of mercury to

1471
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:59,430
describe the pressure in the circulatory system

1472
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:04,940
millimetres of mercury so one atmosphere is seven hundred sixty millimetres of mercury

1473
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:10,710
one of the blood pressures that are relevant in your circulatory system

1474
01:32:10,730 --> 01:32:14,520
how many millimetres of mercury to think

1475
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:21,520
anybody know their blood pressure is

1476
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:24,860
a hundred twenty over eighty one

1477
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:29,650
they'll tell you that a hundred twenty millimetres of mercury over eighty millimetres of mercury

1478
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:34,350
we're going to talk about where those numbers are we're those pressures actually exist in

1479
01:32:34,350 --> 01:32:39,910
a few minutes but that's that's that's the range of pressures in your circulatory system

1480
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:42,610
from zero millimetres of mercury up to

1481
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:45,390
one hundred twenty millimetres of mercury

1482
01:32:45,410 --> 01:32:49,220
roughly and we'll see you go outside that range sometimes now

1483
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:53,070
these are pressures that are inside or circulatory system so they must be

1484
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:57,170
but there are only a fraction of an atmosphere how can that be

1485
01:32:57,190 --> 01:33:00,850
right and atmosphere is seven hundred sixty millimetres of mercury that's the pressure in this

1486
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:05,590
room if your blood pressure is one twenty over eighty

1487
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:07,710
what does that mean

1488
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:13,070
well pressure is a we only care about differences in pressure

1489
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:16,200
its relative pressure that matters not the absolute

1490
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:20,320
pressure so when you say that your your blood pressure is one hundred twenty over

1491
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:25,040
a that means one hundred twenty millimetres of mercury above atmospheric

1492
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:29,400
eighty millimetres mercury above atmosphere

1493
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:32,350
otherwise our blood vessels would collapse

1494
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:37,770
because we're surrounded by air that's that's seven hundred sixty millimetres of mercury

1495
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:42,520
to inflate those vessels you have to be at pressures above that

1496
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:46,970
but since all we care about our pressure differences in the pressure that you measure

1497
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:51,840
when you measure blood pressure is pressure above atmospheric

1498
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:53,900
to make sense

1499
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:57,250
so so delta p is in millimeters of mercury

1500
01:33:57,270 --> 01:33:58,580
q is in

1501
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:00,430
o litres per minute

1502
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:01,940
so are is in

1503
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:03,190
units of

1504
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,390
millimetres of mercury per litre

1505
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:08,420
per minute

1506
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,530
four millimetres

1507
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:10,780
it's in

1508
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,590
units of

1509
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:16,050
if we describe this out

1510
01:34:16,130 --> 01:34:20,230
millimetres of mercury

1511
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:24,860
people are and this is litres per minute

1512
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:28,470
are most units of

1513
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:34,170
some detail about particular techniques the basic idea of defensive programming

1514
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:37,830
is to assume that a if you're getting inputs from the user

1515
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:40,740
they won't necessarily give you the input you've asked for

1516
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:44,420
so if you ask for positive numbers don't count giving you one right

1517
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:45,470
and b

1518
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:48,600
if you're using a piece of program written by

1519
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:50,870
a programmer who is not perfect

1520
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:53,580
perhaps yourself

1521
01:34:53,670 --> 01:34:57,700
there could be mistakes in that program and so you write your program under the

1522
01:34:58,660 --> 01:35:01,040
not only might the user make a mistake

1523
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:03,990
other parts of your program might make a mistake

1524
01:35:04,030 --> 01:35:06,960
and you just put in lots of different tests

1525
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:11,030
under the assumption that you'd rather catch that something has gone wrong

1526
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:13,790
then you have a go wrong and not knowing

1527
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:17,480
and we'll talk later in the term about dozens of different tricks

1528
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,750
but the main thing to keep in mind is the general principle

1529
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:23,440
people are down

1530
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:28,130
and we all make mistakes and therefore you write your program so that

1531
01:35:28,210 --> 01:35:30,360
catastrophes don't occur

1532
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:33,770
when those mistakes are made

1533
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:37,520
john severin to come back to it but that's what basically the goal here and

1534
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:41,160
you only put my hands up when is it stupid programmer i certainly written code

1535
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:45,580
has this problem tried to use my own code that has this problem and good

1536
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:47,530
to is very good

1537
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:50,810
hygiene i'm going to use that word again you're getting into the habit of writing

1538
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:54,110
defensive code up front part of the collection of things that you want to do

1539
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:55,730
is a great thing to do

1540
01:35:55,770 --> 01:35:59,940
i stress in particular because i know you're all going to get into the stage

1541
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:01,810
gotta problems that do

1542
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,010
a couple of hours

1543
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:06,990
you still writing the code you don't want to waste time and then use quotes

1544
01:36:06,990 --> 01:36:10,670
always time doing those extra things to do the defensive programming is one to get

1545
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:12,120
the darn thing done

1546
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,720
it's a bad habit to get into his when you come back to it in

1547
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,570
a hot you later on down the road to really get into the notion of

1548
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:20,020
trying to be defensive is you program

1549
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:24,930
the other thing i want to say here is that this file

1550
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,750
the programme which is run

1551
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:29,030
it's actually very common one

1552
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:31,790
i'm going to give it a nice little name

1553
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:38,730
after referred to as exhaustive enumeration

1554
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:42,230
one i mean he says i'm literally walking through

1555
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,690
all possible

1556
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,490
some parameters some element of the computation

1557
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:50,170
testing everything until i find the right answer

1558
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:55,580
so it's you know you can even write that down essentially saying try

1559
01:36:55,700 --> 01:37:04,420
all reasonable values

1560
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:05,460
until you

1561
01:37:05,470 --> 01:37:09,260
find the solution

1562
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:14,840
and you might say well what i mean is not going to be really expensive

1563
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:17,920
and the answer is yes i guess if you want to search all the pages

1564
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,370
on google one by one yes probably take while

1565
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:24,760
but then lot computation for which is the right way to do it is one

1566
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,690
o exhaustively go through things and just to give you a sense of that

1567
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:34,240
we show you an example going to change this

1568
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:39,470
it nice big number

1569
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:42,520
you computers are fast these days i can make this even bigger is going to

1570
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:45,980
do it fairly quickly so it really is quick to do this it doesn't mean

1571
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:50,040
that exhaustive enumeration is a bad idea is often the right idea to use

1572
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:53,370
so we've seen one example of this is idea of walking through all the images

1573
01:37:53,370 --> 01:37:55,220
look for the square

1574
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:56,820
let's look at some other examples

1575
01:37:56,850 --> 01:38:01,190
in order to try and see other ways in which we could do it

1576
01:38:02,410 --> 01:38:07,990
the particular school over to here let me show you a second example

1577
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:16,890
let me comment that out

1578
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,360
here's another problem

1579
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:20,270
but i like to solve

1580
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:22,980
what i want to find all the divisors

1581
01:38:22,990 --> 01:38:24,280
i have some integer

1582
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:28,240
can figure out all the divisor evenly into it

1583
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:32,090
again the same kind of reasoning says given some value x happened because small wonder

1584
01:38:32,090 --> 01:38:34,000
what an easy way to do this

1585
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:36,530
well let's just start at one

1586
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:40,620
that's my variable i'm going to change and check doesn't divide evenly into

1587
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:44,500
x if it does printed move on to the next one printed out

1588
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:47,260
so again i can do the same kind of thing here you can see that

1589
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:48,070
in fact

1590
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:53,810
the list is run to make sure does the right thing

1591
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:57,770
in fact if we go back to the co what i decided to do here

1592
01:38:57,790 --> 01:38:59,670
so starting

1593
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:03,020
within initialisation by there's my first step is equal to one

1594
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:05,630
i'm going to walk through a little loop or i check

1595
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:08,480
so first of all as long as i less than x so there's my and

1596
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,570
test i'm going to do something in this case the something is i'm going to

1597
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:12,990
look to see

1598
01:39:14,270 --> 01:39:18,230
i divide sexy evenly so remind you that have sort the percent sign that says

1599
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:23,420
divided by i have zero remainder because this because we back the remainder that's equal

1600
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:24,250
to zero

1601
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:25,500
prince something out

1602
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:28,990
and there's my nice increment

1603
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,090
simple little piece notice again exactly the same form

1604
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:33,880
take the thing i wanted to very

1605
01:39:33,910 --> 01:39:35,710
initialize it outside the loop

1606
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:37,780
i have test to see when i'm done

1607
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,530
and i got a set of instructions on doing every time inside the loop in

1608
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:44,800
there's an equal sign you you you should not be sleeping

1609
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,740
you're not supposed to sleep

1610
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,490
this is an equal sign

1611
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:50,510
a minus b

1612
01:39:50,530 --> 01:39:51,350
x got

1613
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:55,410
equals minus b we and business now

1614
01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:57,350
so i'm going to

1615
01:39:57,390 --> 01:40:00,370
this would also you all sleeping

1616
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:04,720
while he was sleeping my goodness

1617
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:10,120
the next the minus pxl miners MG KX well and the miners in the mines

1618
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:11,350
becomes plus

1619
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:15,870
i try not to sleep

1620
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:17,550
x the double dot

1621
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:19,100
now we get plus

1622
01:40:19,910 --> 01:40:21,720
times x dot

1623
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:25,100
now we get plus omega zero squared

1624
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:29,280
times because the valleys omega zero square times ax

1625
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,180
by dividing them out

1626
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:33,620
now i get equals

1627
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:36,260
omega zero squared

1628
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:37,910
times at zero

1629
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:38,990
times cosine

1630
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:41,510
omega t

1631
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:44,640
i'll move this al but in a little bit

1632
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:49,050
and i'm going to look now at the equation at the bottom

1633
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:50,410
and i am now

1634
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:57,430
because of this one

1635
01:40:57,510 --> 01:41:00,910
looks almost like a carbon copy

1636
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:05,240
the one that i had here

1637
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:07,740
we have zero cosine we get

1638
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:11,090
now instead of an of zero divided by n

1639
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,600
cosine omega t

1640
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:16,970
i know this

1641
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:20,640
so this takes the place of my earlier have zero

1642
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,010
divided by n

1643
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:25,260
zero divided by amazon acceleration by the way

1644
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:30,470
better be an acceleration because this is an acceleration apples have to be apples so

1645
01:41:30,470 --> 01:41:34,070
this is an acceleration this is an acceleration and this

1646
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:40,220
is also an acceleration multiplied only scrapped by distance you get distance divided by time

1647
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:45,390
so you see how the the connection between the two go

1648
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:49,300
well recently i got an have zero over and

1649
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:50,910
times cosine omega t

1650
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:55,740
now because of waterloo in motion i'm going to get an omega zero squared

1651
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:58,550
at time zero

1652
01:41:58,590 --> 01:41:59,990
so you see now how

1653
01:42:00,010 --> 01:42:03,030
this motion of my hand indeed

1654
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:04,870
translates into

1655
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:07,140
a force on the object

1656
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,640
well i have the solution

1657
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:10,200
i don't have to do anything

1658
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:13,590
all i have to do is change this by omega zero crowd

1659
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:18,240
times at the zero and i'm done

1660
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:20,490
the difference in equation is identical

1661
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:22,970
i don't even have to change the tangent of delta

1662
01:42:23,030 --> 01:42:26,350
nothing changes this is the only thing that changes

1663
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:29,120
so we done

1664
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:33,370
we can make some predictions

1665
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:37,530
the prediction is that if i'm going to shake this pendulum

1666
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:41,430
and i'm going to do it very slowly

1667
01:42:41,490 --> 01:42:44,430
taking one hour to go to the left and took taking one hour to the

1668
01:42:44,430 --> 01:42:48,430
right and if my amplitude is at zero

1669
01:42:48,450 --> 01:42:50,320
what do you think that the

1670
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:52,430
amplitude a

1671
01:42:52,430 --> 01:42:55,300
the solution of my differential equation will be

1672
01:42:55,370 --> 01:42:58,490
in other words i'm going to show a very slowly

1673
01:42:58,510 --> 01:43:02,660
what do you think it will be without looking at the difference in equation

1674
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:04,680
i just go with my hand like this

1675
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:06,870
amplitude only at the zero

1676
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:10,320
amplitude at the zero and i do it very slow

1677
01:43:10,370 --> 01:43:13,930
what will be the amplitude of a

1678
01:43:14,010 --> 01:43:15,550
at the zero

1679
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:19,490
so you expect that this goes to add to zero

1680
01:43:19,550 --> 01:43:22,530
well if you don't believe it go to this equation

1681
01:43:22,550 --> 01:43:26,910
substituting easier zero in easier you get omega zero created this only because it was

1682
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:29,010
quite easy at this year

1683
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:30,280
exactly what that

1684
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:31,660
equation predicts

1685
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:34,350
but your common sense says the same thing

1686
01:43:34,410 --> 01:43:37,640
now what do you think there is if i'm going to move this pendulum very

1687
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:40,590
slowly to the left and to the right

1688
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:41,890
of course

1689
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:45,160
of course the objective of all and we will be ridiculous if i take one

1690
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:48,720
week to go from here to read the object will be their rights of the

1691
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:53,470
object is always here so you also predict that delta is here

1692
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:54,300
so now

1693
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:55,320
we can make

1694
01:43:56,970 --> 01:43:59,320
prediction that at resonance

1695
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:01,990
must be one half a

1696
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:06,890
the square can be in the time it takes to go from a to b

1697
01:44:06,910 --> 01:44:08,270
and so t

1698
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:09,820
it would be

1699
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:11,060
the square root

1700
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:12,380
of two l

1701
01:44:14,870 --> 01:44:17,180
what's really would have been

1702
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:19,370
the speed b

1703
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:20,820
would be

1704
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:24,300
early on to one

1705
01:44:24,310 --> 01:44:25,410
and so

1706
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:26,610
that would become

1707
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:29,990
we multiply this by a square root

1708
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:30,930
of two

1709
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:32,360
a l

1710
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:35,560
and if you want to see that in all glories details

1711
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,950
and of course you have to take that h

1712
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,490
and you have to multiply that by two out and take the square root

1713
01:44:41,570 --> 01:44:43,020
so we get too

1714
01:44:44,430 --> 01:44:45,660
i'm sign

1715
01:44:45,670 --> 01:44:49,420
o thing minus u of k

1716
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,330
i cosine of data

1717
01:44:51,390 --> 01:44:52,540
and the whole thing

1718
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:53,610
the power

1719
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:56,180
one half that speed

1720
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:58,180
at would b

1721
01:44:58,230 --> 01:44:59,620
i however

1722
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:01,800
what not to do it that way

1723
01:45:01,870 --> 01:45:04,420
i don't find it very elegant

1724
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:05,970
i would say

1725
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:09,120
why don't apply

1726
01:45:09,130 --> 01:45:11,990
the work energy theorem

1727
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:16,880
why not say that the work done

1728
01:45:16,930 --> 01:45:19,520
when that object moves from a to b

1729
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:22,080
must be the kinetic energy

1730
01:45:22,110 --> 01:45:23,430
at point b

1731
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:26,540
why is the kinetic energy at point eight

1732
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:31,990
now i know that i really think zero speed so this is zero

1733
01:45:32,050 --> 01:45:32,820
and so

1734
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:34,640
the kinetic energy of the

1735
01:45:34,690 --> 01:45:37,380
it's clearly and one half

1736
01:45:37,410 --> 01:45:40,290
the square so it comes down

1737
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:45,050
two applying work energy theorems and calculating how much work was done by all the

1738
01:45:45,050 --> 01:45:46,910
forces at stake

1739
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:50,120
conservative and non-conservative makes no difference

1740
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:52,630
and that would equal to one of them

1741
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:56,730
first of all

1742
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:59,390
when it goes from point a to b

1743
01:46:00,990 --> 01:46:01,990
is doing

1744
01:46:02,010 --> 01:46:03,520
positive work

1745
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:05,240
it's going down

1746
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:09,390
and the amount of work the gravity is doing is plus and

1747
01:46:09,450 --> 01:46:10,880
g h

1748
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:12,120
but h

1749
01:46:12,150 --> 01:46:13,790
divided by l

1750
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,830
is the sign of fatah

1751
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,370
so this is also ngl

1752
01:46:18,410 --> 01:46:20,200
times the sign

1753
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:22,750
that's positive work

1754
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:24,970
by gravity

1755
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:27,440
so we have g

1756
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:31,090
times the site of data

1757
01:46:31,170 --> 01:46:32,990
that's the positive contributions

1758
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:34,040
by gravity

1759
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:36,540
and now we get negative contribution

1760
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,740
by friction

1761
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:40,240
because the frictional force is uphill

1762
01:46:40,270 --> 01:46:42,080
but the motion is down

1763
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:46,610
one hundred eighty degrees opposite so i don't have to worry about the dot product

1764
01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:48,520
the cosine of the angle

1765
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,470
minus one

1766
01:46:51,570 --> 01:46:53,660
and so i can ignore

1767
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:56,940
the dot and simply take that force

1768
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:59,490
the frictional force multiplied by that

1769
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:03,070
distance al but i have to to the minus sign

1770
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:04,410
because the cosine

1771
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:05,860
of that angle

1772
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:07,690
equals minus one

1773
01:47:07,850 --> 01:47:09,420
and so i get

1774
01:47:10,610 --> 01:47:12,470
i'm the frictional force

1775
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:19,320
o fado

1776
01:47:19,330 --> 01:47:21,250
that's the negative we're done

1777
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:27,100
and this equals one half

1778
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:29,890
the squared

1779
01:47:29,950 --> 01:47:33,740
and i lose and

1780
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,790
and if you look very carefully

1781
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,840
if you're willing to do that in your head

1782
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:39,790
during the two to the left

1783
01:47:39,850 --> 01:47:42,100
you get two GLI

1784
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:44,000
and then you get

1785
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:47,380
the g sin theta UK

1786
01:47:47,390 --> 01:47:53,870
cosine theta problem you get exactly the same result i find this somehow more pleasing

1787
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:54,990
we use the

1788
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:58,120
work energy theorem

1789
01:47:58,130 --> 01:48:00,110
the friction does negative work

1790
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:01,740
converted into

1791
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:07,520
but that's no problem for the work energy theorem

1792
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:10,320
we know in life that friction

1793
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:14,230
takes kinetic energy out whenever something is moving

1794
01:48:14,270 --> 01:48:16,650
it will come to a halt

1795
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:18,350
if you spin the talk

1796
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:19,150
but we know

1797
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:20,170
at the top

1798
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:21,740
i will not last very long

1799
01:48:22,510 --> 01:48:24,260
of friction

1800
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:27,320
and i have here the top

1801
01:48:27,370 --> 01:48:29,990
i hope you can see it shortly there it is

1802
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:34,020
teeny-weeny the top very cute i play with him to my office

1803
01:48:34,030 --> 01:48:36,940
i'm rotating it

1804
01:48:36,990 --> 01:48:38,530
and you see that friction

1805
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:41,090
sticking out kinetic energy

1806
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:44,970
and it's converting it to eat

1807
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:48,380
please stay on the desk will you please not fall on the floor

1808
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:50,270
it does was great

1809
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:51,380
so you see

1810
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:54,620
that's what friction does kinetic energy has been removed

1811
01:48:54,670 --> 01:48:56,210
and now

1812
01:48:56,250 --> 01:48:57,950
it has been converted to heat

1813
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:02,660
this service is a little smaller than the desk
