1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
at all you know

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,950
well that's one

3
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,610
o flat

4
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:30,170
and what is

5
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,990
o thing point

6
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,720
and then

7
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:20,320
matter of fact

8
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,650
he was

9
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,320
is a

10
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:36,050
that would have stopped work

11
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,140
in fact

12
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:56,910
it's all

13
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,720
or they black sea

14
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:06,450
and i recall this is the

15
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,640
there a very comprehensive

16
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,180
all right

17
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,060
far from it with

18
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,970
you make

19
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,680
the main

20
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,830
are man

21
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,430
and that would be

22
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,500
then the average

23
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,260
from next and and more

24
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,450
are going to when not

25
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,350
so there is no

26
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,260
trying to measure

27
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,540
how one

28
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:24,990
i think are very revealing for

29
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,910
because the

30
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:37,970
on the main point is that only he would on to which out fans

31
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,620
i learned a lot

32
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:47,220
so what you are not always develop

33
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,810
which is kind of

34
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,290
they are

35
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,520
thing that i want to more

36
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,370
there were about one

37
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,930
is this a for

38
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,640
the visual and

39
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,640
so there's a lot more

40
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,500
it is

41
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,620
this rule

42
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,100
that have been known for all role

43
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,220
course there

44
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,970
so there

45
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,330
right now the economy

46
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,270
it was the

47
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,120
if you

48
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,290
one two

49
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,290
do this as long as we

50
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,180
and on the

51
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,330
a pretty well known

52
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,220
it was a

53
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,430
will show

54
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,200
in this

55
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,680
but the problem is that the

56
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,000
so i

57
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,740
what the

58
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,850
we didn't worry just go

59
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,430
of work

60
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,720
so anyway role

61
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,540
nine years

62
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,140
he is

63
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,970
according to the results roles

64
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,490
you know

65
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:26,270
that would be validated according to

66
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,990
big rule should

67
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,930
he was

68
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,350
not to be

69
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,970
if you don't

70
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,950
we need to realize

71
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,830
that means

72
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,260
there is a

73
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,850
the good the bad

74
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,310
is going to be like

75
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,240
one day

76
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,850
we want

77
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,390
bound we want

78
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,500
delta x

79
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,980
less than some

80
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,580
of stealth

81
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:36,220
lessons that will sort tell us how hard the problem is to solve

82
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,890
right now a couple of points to make

83
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,180
you could say

84
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,830
where are we might also not know a very well

85
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,740
somebody's made that comment after an earlier lecture

86
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,720
we might

87
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:57,040
there are we ought maybe taking into account delta and the answer is true so

88
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,500
it so i could do what i'm doing now

89
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,970
allowing delta a that's absolutely belongs there is when we do these elimination steps where

90
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,330
we're making little mistakes in

91
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,500
and on the right-hand side are making mistakes in b

92
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,560
let me

93
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,180
make my life easier to think about the right hand side but left behind

94
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,390
that's one point

95
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,700
the second point is

96
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,270
really relative error is

97
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,950
the right thing

98
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,200
if i'm just estimate is really what i would like to know

99
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,790
the size of delta x compared to the size of x

100
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,370
i could change if i just wanted all text to be small or large i

101
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,140
could multiply by zillions

102
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,200
would multiply expires and then it would

103
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,640
nonsense out of my errors

104
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,600
but if i

105
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,470
look at the relative error

106
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,870
on line b by millions will change the relative

107
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,600
so i would like this to be less than so

108
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,580
and again on the right hand side so so this is less than some some

109
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,850
multiple and that's the question of the error in

110
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,790
the relative error in b

111
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,810
is that i'm sorry that that's written solo down because that's the that's the question

112
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,370
what's the constant how large could the relative error in x b if i know

113
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,370
something about the relative error in the cases like what i controlled by

114
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,080
by keeping more digits

115
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,450
and this is

116
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,980
what comes out

117
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:54,450
no we can if we made errors in the process of solving it we can

118
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,350
say OK that's that's part of the b

119
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:03,100
so so we're assuming that we solve this guy exact

120
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,000
but it was the wrong problem

121
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,200
so i want to know

122
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,970
if i solve the wrong problem

123
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:22,200
how different is that relatively speaking from solving the right problem

124
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,290
and you see that

125
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,750
somehow our little bit the business of norms or help

126
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,520
because what do we know about

127
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,560
norm here and

128
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,350
so on let's see if we can get some

129
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:44,600
you see that this is this tells me how hard the problem is to solve

130
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,910
that's the size of that that so that's going to be the condition number

131
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,410
and i want to know

132
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,810
what is it

133
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,270
a typical problem and actually matlab will

134
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:03,720
estimated if you if you given that the linear system given that given this problem

135
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,830
it will estimate the condition number will give you a signal the this and if

136
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,200
it's a wildly i condition number

137
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,950
mallet will tell you

138
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,740
OK so now

139
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,430
let's just get figure out what that c should be

140
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,850
OK so what can we say

141
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,910
so the true solution as a sequel

142
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,620
inverse peak

143
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,890
that's the true solution so their souls

144
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,100
the norm of x

145
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,290
is less than one

146
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,370
the norm of a inverse

147
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,520
times the normal b

148
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,160
so we're using norms here for

149
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,910
a inverse

150
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,290
that's that's OK that's the definition of the norm somehow

151
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:58,040
what will i mean when the norm of a and version b

152
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:03,350
the inverse is the big matrix that sort of is telling us what

153
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:10,750
it's telling us that the matrix is nearly singular it's inverses giant

154
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,470
i want to do things relatively

155
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,180
because so if i have multiplied by a million are divided by a million i

156
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,770
can make the inverse million bigger million smaller without changing reality here

157
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,640
so it's

158
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,890
so it's relative that's reality OK now i got this equation how can i can

159
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,640
well of

160
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,120
in press

161
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:10,030
this right

162
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:27,340
and it

163
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:36,340
and that very

164
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,980
at the time he

165
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,070
used to be

166
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:04,380
you're wrong

167
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:49,670
that's it

168
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,820
it means that

169
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,280
get gold

170
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,320
so not

171
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,290
you know all

172
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,640
these are

173
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,400
that is

174
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:51,950
and long

175
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,620
this year

176
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,420
and i

177
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,790
the area

178
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:07,470
it might be

179
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,590
you know

180
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,960
one of the

181
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:47,280
these are the

182
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:54,700
he's your brain

183
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,800
xe for so we have n times the times k

184
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,300
as the size of the data structure the question is does that actually show up

185
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,200
in the bound as well

186
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,080
i don't know

187
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,240
we've had a wicket remind me out of follow and that's actually that's that's very

188
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,740
cool idea

189
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,370
and in particular a lot of a lot of problems actually had that structure certainly

190
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:20,030
the gridworld that the important people get fixated on have local conductivity right so given

191
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,890
state can only reach a small number of neighbours not the full state space

192
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:39,160
so i will i i'll just so that's a good question i don't know

193
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,200
what you

194
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,530
i don't know how i feel about that but i like the question

195
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,580
but i ask it again when i get to the part where i say oh

196
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,300
and this is going to show that you're not actually optimal after any given

197
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,910
when i get others context that set up shortly that make it easier to i

198
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,390
know but i'm going to get it will be easier for me to explain later

199
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,890
so it is it seems silly to repeat now anyway

200
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,060
not itself

201
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,700
OK so the question was

202
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,530
i've been shamed into it so the question was

203
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:17,580
the mist mistake bound and which the PAC MDP framework for sets

204
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,390
it's basically one says the total number of mistakes in an infinite run is bounded

205
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,910
by certain numbers

206
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,970
but what doesn't say is that

207
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,830
after this amount of learning from here on forward your optimal

208
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:33,060
OK so those are two kinds of things that you might think about learning rate

209
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,100
one says that you're going to do all your training and learning in some fixed

210
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,140
period and then from then on you've got it and the other one says you

211
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,580
can make a mistake could happen today could happen next week but each time you

212
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,680
make a mistake getting closer and closer to perfection

213
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,990
now if you look at any fixed block of time

214
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,640
if it's a big enough block the fraction of mistakes that you make block has

215
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,600
to be going to zero right but the fact that matter is in the bounds

216
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,970
of talking about there is no last moment which you can make a mistake and

217
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,310
part of the reason for this sort of inevitable in the for MDP cases because

218
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:09,120
imagine if there's a transition that really really low probability so most of your life

219
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,930
you kind of live which at home which started watching the movie the matrix which

220
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:18,240
i assume most people see my kids and being the minds are being banned but

221
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,470
let's say you live your life you live life and then when they discovered that's

222
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:27,140
not reality there's this other reality over here suddenly you can not getting near optimal

223
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,990
reward anymore even though you were in the old space and so

224
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,310
the moment which that transition happens you can't put it down on is so low

225
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:38,450
probability event can happen anytime in the future so it's really it's really i think

226
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,140
it's impossible to get the kind of and you're hoping for

227
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,640
but i have come to grips with this one i think it's OK alright so

228
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,010
what i'd like to do is to draw

229
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,740
to to

230
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,120
kind of extend this idea

231
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,490
so we can talk about continuous basis we can talk about space we have more

232
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,220
structure we can talk about

233
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,010
lots of things like that by i

234
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,990
expanding this idea

235
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:04,870
after focusing on the following problem model learning is a supervised learning problem

236
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,850
given examples of the form state action and inputs state action in your post output

237
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,220
next or probability of next

238
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:17,220
it's not specific this idea is not specific to table lookup like this building a

239
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,040
big literal explicit graph

240
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,280
what we'd like to do is expand these kinds of efficient learning results

241
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:30,370
the generalizing the notion of the transition function to be just some function approximator something

242
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,350
that maps states and actions to next to

243
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:38,410
but the problem is that the existing first to kind of standard machine learning theory

244
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:42,720
doesn't give us quite the right guarantees for us to build the reinforcement learning to

245
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,330
the amount of ice so this is sort of

246
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,560
the context i thought i'd be able to use a moment ago

247
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,510
so so here's the deal so we talked a little bit about paxo in in

248
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,680
the supervised setting

249
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,560
park is set up like this input to drawn for some fixed distribution we get

250
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,760
to observe labels for the first set of them say m of them

251
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,260
and then future inputs are drawn from the distribution o so once we've done that

252
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,240
of functions that take values in some bounded range

253
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,300
then with probability rapidly approaches one

254
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:18,990
uniformly over the class we have expectations close to sample averages where

255
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:21,590
closes in terms of these rademacher

256
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,160
rademacher averages

257
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:29,300
so not not to be considered fused with the risk of of fire escape right

258
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,220
this is the rademacher averages about that class

259
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,820
these are real valued functions

260
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,550
so now we're going to consider

261
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,640
the class

262
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,240
class of functions

263
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,200
that the federal losses right as oregon

264
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,390
convex loss OK these functions map from the domain x cross y

265
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:54,040
right so we'll call function g so that evaluated ex-wives file flight times f of

266
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,530
OK and this is the guy that we want to have

267
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,180
you know his expectation

268
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,240
uniformly close to sample average right so the

269
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,090
by risk this this expectation malindi the fire

270
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:10,410
right and this is the sample average then uniformly close over

271
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,620
over some some costs

272
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,570
g the class g is the

273
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:23,470
class of gx where it comes from some complex the classification

274
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,160
OK so

275
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,680
for this class we we we can worry about

276
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,740
the rademacher averages

277
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,200
right of these of these viruses

278
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,220
OK so it turns out there are some easy

279
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,450
two let's evaluate the

280
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,340
these rademacher averages

281
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,030
so i go through

282
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,820
a few of those

283
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:51,350
so i have twenty minutes

284
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,550
so the first one is

285
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,840
is is true just to remind you the rademacher averages

286
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,300
but it's the

287
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,050
it's the supremum over a class of

288
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,320
this inner product between random

289
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,850
plus minus one vector and the values of f evaluated at

290
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:27,470
in data points x one to xn so in place in our case of functions

291
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:31,550
are defined not just an expert on on these x on x because one right

292
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:37,590
so we have x i y appears without considering you know we will be replacing

293
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,840
if there by

294
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:43,140
five y times ethics

295
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:52,720
brain but

296
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,510
OK so the

297
00:36:54,530 --> 00:37:01,470
the from the definition of rademacher averages we're doing our optimisation over this class obviously

298
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,050
if we do the optimisation over smaller set we

299
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:10,030
we were get bigger value so so for some subset the rademacher averages and bigger

300
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,890
six percent

301
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,450
we took

302
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:24,090
actually this is OK so if we if we include class and all negations of

303
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,720
functions in class

304
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,930
taking the convex hull of that

305
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:35,090
doesn't change the rademacher averages at all

306
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:39,260
right and that's because we're taking a supremum over this class

307
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,410
OK of

308
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:45,140
something it's already linear criterion in f

309
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,390
OK so you take the convex hull is the extreme points there are always going

310
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,640
to achieve that that linear

311
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,010
the achieve the optimality criterion

312
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:59,070
OK so we don't change anything by by introducing the but by including all convex

313
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,780
combinations of these functions

314
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,430
if we multiply functions by constant

315
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:11,320
then we multiplying the rademacher averages by by constant

316
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:17,570
OK since we're maximizing which we take the absolute value of the constant

317
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:21,610
so you know this is this is also straightforward from the definition

318
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,110
this one is the only one that's not

319
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:29,120
immediate from the definition and and you know there's an element

320
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,490
but not so short argument

321
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:34,110
so this this is called the telegraph

322
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:38,410
contraction inequality that

323
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:42,870
that if you have a lipschitz function you compose your functions with a lipschitz function

324
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,010
right then

325
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:49,490
the rademacher averages and no bigger than the lipschitz constant times these functions right so

326
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,200
so i think if you think about it if we have an upper bound on

327
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,970
to the element

328
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,050
one of the hash function is going to give us is going to give us

329
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,750
no particular slot

330
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,180
there's one might go up here

331
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:06,350
i have another one here and there

332
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,710
we get to distribute the elements for over the

333
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:16,760
over the

334
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,990
so what's the

335
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,780
and that's going to occur

336
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,800
as we do this

337
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:28,760
so far i have been a little bit lucky

338
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:32,600
what's the problem potentially going to be

339
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,030
one two

340
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,290
things are in s

341
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,800
more specifically

342
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,390
assigned to the same values a big ideas and he gets mapped to the same

343
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,210
what somebody else has already been mapped

344
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,600
when this happens we call that a collision

345
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,830
so we're trying to make these things down

346
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,510
into a small set

347
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:06,230
what we could get unlucky and our mapping

348
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,050
particularly if we map enough these guys

349
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,180
not going to fit

350
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:17,420
so my record

351
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:28,610
being inserted

352
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,750
and already

353
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,570
occupied slot

354
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,490
the collision occurred

355
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,890
it looks like this method

356
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,400
but now there's there's a pretty simple thing we can do

357
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,210
what should we do when

358
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,680
two things matter since like

359
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,520
one represents the whole set

360
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,110
you can use any data

361
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,240
tree like

362
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,200
ash cash what you do is use hashing scheme

363
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,590
can actually just kick it out

364
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,350
you don't care about representing a set precisely

365
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,810
but in a hash table you

366
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,900
programming you often want to make sure that the values you've never exactly

367
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,750
evaluation sets you can tell whether something belongs to the set

368
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,580
what's a good strategy

369
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,360
he created a list

370
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,180
for each slot

371
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:52,300
just put all the elements that hash to the same slot into the list

372
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,530
and that's called resolving

373
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:03,010
by chain

374
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,120
the idea

375
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,910
o records

376
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,830
in the same slot

377
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,670
for example

378
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,690
imagine this is my

379
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:35,070
and this for example is slot right

380
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,670
have several things

381
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,630
they are

382
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:50,630
sort of you are you

383
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:54,270
several things that may have been inserted

384
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,220
into this

385
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,710
table of the elements of s

386
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,060
and what of this was just

387
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:05,350
link them together

388
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,620
so no point here

389
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,430
this is the satellite data

390
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:15,250
they are all linked together in slot right

391
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,510
then the hash function

392
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,900
applied to forty nine

393
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,910
got be the hash function

394
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,150
is equal the hash function of fifty two

395
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:37,330
which equals one

396
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,370
ratings because they're pretty much arbitrary

397
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,850
so we to used to point five

398
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:47,390
o point seven and zero so it's not clear what how to map a single

399
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,480
numeric scale

400
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,350
so what is here is just a

401
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:58,560
the in every output based on the greatest humans provide into one of the three

402
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,290
groups so for example if all four rate this sentence when it comes to this

403
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:10,350
if all surfaces ungrammatical sentences systems here if three of two thousand seven hundred ninety

404
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,790
five and two thousand seven

405
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,810
well was just one missing

406
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,670
can also consider it comes into this

407
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,060
this is also the idea of the average

408
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,020
for every sentence order have well exactly

409
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,390
four generations and this the judgement we assign to the

410
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:31,830
what has just one mistake or

411
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,710
and she

412
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:39,920
so what you notice right away the baseline will only every sentence

413
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,080
the climate so compared to the other two

414
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,640
configurations see that the number

415
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:51,620
changes the of two-thirds of all the sentences produced by

416
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:56,270
complex integration system two thirds were immigrants

417
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:59,480
and that's

418
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:09,270
what is the sum to one

419
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:18,880
which i just

420
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,130
you solutions someone

421
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,870
doesn't work well if you do this

422
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,910
if you wanted to

423
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:36,380
so she is the dimension d with less than one percent but you can use

424
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,220
this one

425
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:38,250
that's a

426
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:43,940
he five and they were fifty by these words

427
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,000
well i mean it's

428
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:50,310
so it's not just so you can imagine that every changes close

429
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:57,650
if you get a full would some try to think of these tend to the

430
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,800
lines so that

431
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:04,330
the final qualities about the average length of the impressionists of the members of the

432
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:05,920
sentence and the cost

433
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:13,300
it was twenty to thirty five finished and compression are generated at the average length

434
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:15,260
of eight ten or twelve

435
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:20,500
so the spanish so i will talk much stable so he can

436
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:23,790
notice right away a simple enough and

437
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:29,920
the more the better more medical center but again you should take this number separated

438
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,940
from the second iteration

439
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:44,050
works so have a cluster twenty sentences so that means that they

440
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:49,760
well i was for example but this was somewhere between ten and fifteen

441
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,750
so just

442
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,620
the difference between one last chance to ten articles

443
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:58,760
which means that i get just ten sentences if i have a question forty five

444
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,380
minutes that have passed

445
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:01,840
four different

446
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:06,980
so you must what i did was give me give me forty five percent and

447
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,010
now i'm talking about it

448
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:15,010
the average length is computed for each feature

449
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:18,830
those clusters

450
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:31,150
those are now being it's

451
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:36,920
yes i suppose i haven't but a necessary one

452
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:41,810
the reason for that is that the system is designed to work out any syntactic

453
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,970
in most systems that exist today

454
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,130
that information so here one of the main ones so also

455
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:53,340
it's not only cards to some practical because it's not good enough to

456
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,300
is it practical results the

457
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,210
from the original site was

458
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:06,220
interesting to show that although so most people almost surely all systems use syntactic trees

459
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:13,220
here we show that actually you can do about that so that

460
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:17,270
this means and then in this case it would be interesting to compare this system

461
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:22,790
chooses that information on the other hand we also need to go to camp in

462
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,310
number system which is much more information

463
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:31,930
with the system which is very simple like this

464
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:41,460
he all but it's what i so there are two sets on one hand you

465
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,580
want to show you some that you can go and use it on the other

466
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,750
hand there

467
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,270
so what he she was also

468
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:53,300
this very traditional to make use it to show it's not

469
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,750
all this is we need to see that sometimes

470
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:18,370
so i is an open and p

471
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,550
part of speech tagging

472
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:23,500
it's available in general many languages

473
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:31,520
it's this this was just this method is very very very straightforward if you see

474
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,930
so this what you see here seem to these is the same as saying is

475
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:45,720
for this which was just this is very

476
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:47,600
but this OK go

477
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,840
is is to

478
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:54,760
OK so here's right so just all conveys so

479
00:49:55,220 --> 00:50:00,010
i split just the sentences into words right face it to

480
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,230
you want to see the answer is no

481
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:07,050
all right so now let's return back to simple mixture models we now have a

482
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:11,150
goal which is to be small selection problems and then discuss a solution to the

483
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:14,160
mixture model how do you pick a problem for mixture models and see where it

484
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,000
breaks down we try to understand it

485
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,810
OK so the chinese restaurant process so forget what kinds so far and now focus

486
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,950
on probability theory

487
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,560
that's the process which customers arrive restaurant roundtables

488
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:31,550
and therein customers coming in and the first customer always at the first table

489
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:34,420
the subsequent customer sits at a table

490
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:37,680
drawn from the following vision you sit at table proportional to the number of people

491
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,030
already in that table that's what am i

492
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:44,940
a start of new table proportional to some prime parameter make that you have

493
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,910
for now

494
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:49,360
so i sit here

495
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,980
with probability the first customer comes in sets here

496
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,280
with probability one

497
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:58,160
and the next this sources there are probably happens the new table probably have

498
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,860
right so that in this make out but not the one that the correct thing

499
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,100
to do right is proportional to that

500
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:12,450
so after and people come in this in a random partition of n customers in

501
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:15,210
some of here some here some here somewhere

502
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:19,020
it's random however the number of occupied tables is random

503
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,030
and it scales of log

504
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:26,480
kind of long tail as more and more customers come more more tables get occupied

505
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:30,760
all right and the really fantastic thing about this is that this defines an exchangeable

506
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,370
distribution of partition the customers exchangeable here

507
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:38,260
the nice ride this is an integer order came in first order

508
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,860
the actual in the end result is in the water

509
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,340
the exchangeable

510
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,780
right so if you want to easy to prove that is right down the probability

511
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,820
measure this induces i this all later slide take the product of those into the

512
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,700
common in apparent order

513
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:59,650
so because exchangeable by d that is there must exist an underlying data in some

514
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:01,890
generalized sensible behind

515
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:02,660
and this

516
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,360
probability distribution must be enabled over data

517
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,080
and that the is not a vector

518
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,280
i don't think it turns out to be the dirichlet process is the international objects

519
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:16,340
you'll see that little bit later but what are you doing

520
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:20,930
so i learned about this about six first with the birth theta randomized algorithms kind

521
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:24,010
of like story how i learned about this in the whole field

522
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:28,910
i gave a problem to my randomized algorithms which was the following

523
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:33,590
take a random partition permutations of the numbers one through n

524
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:38,370
so i have no interest whatsoever in factorial permutations like a random permutation of the

525
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:44,440
one of the problem the probability that an i j on the same site

526
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:49,970
permutations are something like right what was probably the who the idea in the same

527
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:54,280
so most listened can solve this problem is about three pages of combinatorics and probability

528
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,210
fundamental problem try it out on

529
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:01,260
and in the most of it will be converted to have

530
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:05,360
so that seems to simple the means i my colleague jim pitman is an expert

531
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,800
coming from the probability

532
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,200
you know and has come one come out like this and he says you have

533
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,310
to learn about five

534
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,640
five restaurant process here is the proof of a little problem

535
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:20,620
what's the problem i and j are together in the same cycle

536
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,520
well by exchangeability this is probably the same probably the number one and number two

537
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,580
on the same talk

538
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:30,820
and everyone always sits at table number one and number two sets are probably happen

539
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:35,180
with some other people probably have

540
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,620
and he said there's about thirty other things you can improve really simply by writing

541
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,210
so i this in bold up and learned all about

542
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:48,700
this field and get some of you have heard about this field as well

543
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:51,690
OK so now that in probability theory the saboteur statistics

544
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,800
machine learning

545
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,310
what's happening with mixture models

546
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:59,300
well i really very simple now the tables are clusters

547
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:03,010
in the end customers that are stable are the data points in that cluster and

548
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,280
we are random number of clusters

549
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,730
we don't to fix the number of clusters

550
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,690
it comes out of the probability

551
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,220
and today now let's get the likelihood is that kind of the prior on the

552
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:17,440
number of clusters likely to follow whatever the first customer sits at table

553
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,110
they draw from a problems with some parameters for that table so i said that

554
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:25,430
first stable i think they are from some prior on on data

555
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:27,050
mean covariance

556
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,070
and everybody says that table here is that mean covariance

557
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,910
and if you start a new table you take your own meaning covering for that

558
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:39,710
i get a cluster i mean covariance for every cable from imagine pictorially a much

559
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,830
faster pace

560
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:45,680
OK so the likelihood of the usual mixture likelihood now that kind of data at

561
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,190
a table the data points are just the galaxy or whatever probability of x given

562
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,880
OK and i have a fully specified probability models

563
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,770
well the table problem parameters problem data

564
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,750
because what you've pierced us now is internal logistics they come into company right up

565
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:04,660
here with the headquarters and take over your entire

566
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:07,660
internal logistics cycle in sourcing

567
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,920
so you have yet to sheep laptop

568
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:15,210
and it breaks and you go to the warranties is called one hundred help you

569
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:19,330
call one hundred help and they tell you take it sheep laptop to the upstart

570
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:23,100
and senators my head back to seventy two hours here's what you don't know

571
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:24,640
tutorship laptop

572
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:30,360
goes from the up store to the ups hub at louisville airport in kentucky where

573
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:35,820
an airline hangar at louisville airport in the clean room your toshiba laptop is repaired

574
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,670
by u be yes employed

575
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:44,020
it never touches so she hands to she basically unsourced entirely to you yes

576
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:48,440
maybe the outcome you wanna get the kids who personally sneakers you go online naked

577
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,740
outcome what you don't know is on the other side that's screen someone in finally

578
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,900
brown shorts

579
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,390
who's taking down your order

580
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:00,930
on picking and packing the shoes from the

581
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:03,310
ninety warehouse the ups managers

582
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:07,580
and shipping them to you and collecting the money and be happy view yes see

583
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,300
the poppa johns pizza tracker by

584
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,630
i guess who's driving

585
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,620
say it with me now someone in funny brown shorts okay

586
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:22,160
because you upstairs in source sorry but the chances in source the delivery of the dough

587
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:24,210
from the bakeries to their outlets

588
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:29,160
the up yes so this is a whole new form of collaboration it requires more

589
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,060
micro you get a huge amount of standardization

590
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,980
and as a result it's going to be a huge flat here

591
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:41,110
over time there are hundreds probably thousands of companies today that no longer touch any of their products

592
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,150
there are nothing but marketing shells in source

593
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:45,470
basically the

594
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:47,150
to pierce

595
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:52,030
the sixth the last new form of collaboration i i call informing

596
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,680
informing and that's my name for google

597
00:56:55,970 --> 00:57:01,190
that's my name for search because i can now inform myself i can collaborate with data

598
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,280
all by

599
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,280
tivo is a former informing for entertainment

600
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,030
and informing is a powerful new form of collaboration

601
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:16,280
so just review in the first three it created this platform for multiple forms of

602
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:22,940
collaboration then we have the next six new forms of collaboration outsourcing offshoring open-sourcing supply

603
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,940
chain in sourcing and informing

604
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,260
that's nine

605
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:28,490
what's the ten there are ten

606
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,210
i argue in the book that tent

607
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,560
i simply call the steroids

608
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,760
steroids are wireless

609
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,780
voice over the internet

610
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,640
in file sharing

611
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,380
and what these steroids are doing

612
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:48,940
is now turbocharging all six so these new forms of collaboration

613
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:51,410
so i can now do anyone

614
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,830
from anywhere

615
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,440
with any device

616
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:01,660
that's the second chapter and that's the argument about what i consider to be the

617
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,490
ten forces that flat the world

618
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:09,450
the third chapter and stop after this tries tied together at least the base argument

619
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:13,720
the third chapter is called the triple convergence and basically what i argue is that

620
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,670
sometime around the year two thousand

621
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:18,210
there were three huge convergences

622
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:22,700
which all came together to really shape the brief history the twenty first century

623
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,390
the first convergence i would argue is all tended these flatteners

624
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:34,010
right around the year two thousand converted into a tipping point with the complementarities between

625
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,340
them all started to work together

626
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,280
so they

627
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:44,950
informing helped outsourcing outsourcing healthy offshore in the open sourcing drove in sourcing all the

628
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:49,510
complementarities between these ten flatness started to work together

629
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,700
and when they did

630
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:53,720
they created

631
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,050
the flat world

632
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,820
what i mean by the flat world

633
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,550
they created a global

634
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,530
web-enabled platform

635
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:03,880
from multiple forms of sharing knowledge and work

636
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,700
irrespective of time

637
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,720
distance geography

638
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,430
or even increasingly language

639
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,590
that's what i mean when i say the world is flat i mean we've created a global web enabled platform

640
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:19,400
from multiple forms of sharing knowledge and work

641
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:22,430
irrespective of time distance geography

642
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:24,340
and increasingly even

643
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,880
i believe that's platform

644
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,760
if you if you think about the platform

645
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,050
you can explain more things

646
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:35,240
about what's happening in the world today

647
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,990
and with any other r

648
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:40,910
you can explain the rise in energy

649
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:43,700
and you can explain the rise in outsourcing

650
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:45,430
you can explain

651
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,510
and might ease

652
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:47,510
open course

653
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:51,090
end you can explain

654
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,050
nine eleven in arcadia

655
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:54,340
so there

656
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,760
first convergence is what flat in the world

657
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,570
by producing this new platform

658
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:02,930
that more people than ever can plug and play

659
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,610
the second convergence

660
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:07,900
is that we are just at the beginning of this

661
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:14,030
is that we're all having to learn the horizontal lines ourselves says we're all having to learn to adapt are

662
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,590
business processes are study habits

663
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:18,010
are innovative

664
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,170
approaches to this new platform

665
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:27,340
as are going from world where value is created in vertical silos largely i've command and control

666
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:33,380
during world war value will be created increasingly horizontally by u connect and collaborate with

667
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:38,510
which is that the beginning and making all the changes from going from vertical to horizontal

668
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:43,680
now the best way to understand this is i think the whole david the stanford

669
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,840
economist at a remarkable essay that i'm sure many of you've had a rate electrification

670
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,090
and yes the question why was it when electricity first appeared

671
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,050
we didn't get a productivity books

672
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:57,280
and the answer is we looked into it was because get the actual productivity boost

673
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,700
from electric motors replacing steam engines

674
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:05,740
we had first redesign buildings from tall multi-story buildings that could accommodate big steam engines with their police

675
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:11,630
two smaller laws long buildings that's where the factory could operate with small electric motors

676
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:15,170
and the managers had to adapt their management practices and

677
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:20,610
after architects adapted the way buildings look then shop-floor stewart had to adapt how they

678
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:23,070
manage the shop floor so there were a million

679
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:26,760
different habits and structures that had change

680
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,880
and once they changed the tipping point

681
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:31,530
then we really got

682
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:34,360
the productivity boost from electrification

683
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:38,280
well i would argue that we are just at the beginning and doing the same thing

684
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,150
with this horizontal platform are just the beginning

685
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,410
changing our habits supports underlies ourselves

686
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:47,700
actually discovered this in a very personal way

687
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:49,340
when i was working on the book

688
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:54,340
on the other hand the says the maryland my daughter my oldest daughter's a sophmore

689
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,490
courses school in new haven connecticut

690
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,170
i was going to visit her last march

691
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,860
it is a complete pain in the behind

692
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:05,430
to go from the there's the maryland to new haven connecticut

693
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,110
you've to drive from the says that

694
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:10,590
be w i airport in baltimore

695
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:16,880
take southwest airlines from baltimore to hertford and then drive from hartford for an hour to know

696
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,200
the problem is going up less print

697
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,740
taking into bags been closed for my daughter

698
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,130
hand on

699
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,070
on and i

700
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:30,130
the central and southwestern the southwestern and flown southwest but as you may know itself

701
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,470
you you don't get a reserve see

702
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,130
you just get a ticket that says it

703
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:36,010
at very low temperatures

704
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:39,380
there is very little thermal agitation

705
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,400
and so on

706
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,570
you can then

707
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:44,300
he zero line

708
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,340
and so the value for

709
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:49,190
half of them will then be

710
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:51,940
ferromagnetic materials

711
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:52,990
if you call it

712
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:54,070
you expect the

713
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,630
kappa of them going up

714
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:57,950
so you get stronger field inside

715
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:00,900
so its temperature dependence

716
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,210
if you

717
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,970
make material very heart

718
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:09,240
then it can lose completely its ferromagnetic properties

719
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,920
what happens at a certain temperature that these those range domain fall apart

720
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:17,150
sort of domains themselves no longer exist

721
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:22,940
and that happens at the very precise temperature is very strange

722
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:26,340
that's also something that is very difficult to understand the unique

723
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,130
quantum mechanics for that

724
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:32,380
but at a certain temperature which we call the curie temperature

725
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:36,110
with four ironies thousand forty three degrees kelvin

726
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:40,450
which is seven hundred seventy degrees centigrade all of a sudden the domains disappear and

727
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:43,360
the material becomes paramagnetic

728
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,530
in other words if

729
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:48,900
ferromagnetic material will be hanging on the magnet

730
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:52,880
and you would need up above the curie point it will fall off

731
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,530
it will become paramagnetic but paramagnetic material in general doesn't hang on the mac

732
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:59,030
because the forces involved

733
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:00,990
quite small

734
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,900
and the change is very abrupt

735
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,720
and i'm going to show that to you

736
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:09,170
was the demonstration i have a

737
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,900
right there you will see very shortly

738
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,400
this is not a washer

739
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:25,170
honest you

740
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:28,070
and there is here

741
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,550
a magnet

742
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:31,970
i don't know what it is north of thousand doesn't matter

743
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:35,780
and here we have a thermal shield

744
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,990
so this washer

745
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:41,470
it's against the thermal shield because it being attracted want to go to a strong

746
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:43,990
magnetic field is ferromagnetic

747
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,900
so it will be sitting here

748
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,190
and i'm going to read it up above the curie point seven hundred seventy degrees

749
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,630
you will see it full of

750
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:57,360
what it calls again goes back on again

751
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:59,220
so i can make you see

752
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:05,650
properties disappear

753
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:08,320
let me make sure i have a

754
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:14,420
proper settings

755
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:16,550
i see nothing

756
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:17,720
i see nothing

757
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:19,990
there is

758
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:21,860
so here is this

759
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:25,610
here is shield

760
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:28,740
and the magnet behind it you can see it is right there

761
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,820
so it goes against the right goes to

762
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,090
towards the

763
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:40,320
goes into the strong magnetic field magnetic field is not uniform outside the magnet

764
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,710
and it goes towards so now

765
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:49,550
i'm going to hit

766
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,240
it will take awhile

767
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,450
because the seven hundred seventy degrees centigrade

768
01:05:54,510 --> 01:06:01,260
it's not so easy to achieve

769
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,050
the three most

770
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:06,220
common ferrimagnetic materials

771
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,840
cobalt nickel and iron

772
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:11,740
nicole has a

773
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,280
curie point

774
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:16,900
of only three hundred fifty eight degrees centigrade

775
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:23,150
so if this were nickel all

776
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:28,530
this when they call

777
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:35,300
you like that

778
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,190
i think i strong hand

779
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:43,380
from and the conning

780
01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:45,780
i think i fixed

781
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:49,190
i'm a big boy did it myself today

782
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,940
i lost my temper that's the detail

783
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,970
OK let's try again

784
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,190
so somebody it up i was mentioning that

785
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:00,740
nicole has a curie point

786
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,190
of the three hundred fifty eight degrees centigrade

787
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,970
but it is quite low

788
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:09,070
this is seven hundred seventy

789
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:11,950
cobalt is fourteen hundred degrees

790
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:15,300
curie point

791
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:19,110
very special material

792
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:22,300
god already was ferromagnetic in the winter

793
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,400
when the temperature is below sixteen degrees centigrade

794
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,720
but it is paramagnetic in the summer

795
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:31,550
when the temperature is above sixty degrees centigrade

796
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:34,860
beginning to be wrap up now

797
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:37,670
seven hundred seventy degrees centigrade

798
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:39,340
you expect

799
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,550
some visible light

800
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:43,940
in the form of red light then goes

801
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:46,220
and i will keep repeating

802
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,900
pp thoughts on it that you can see

803
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:49,590
that indeed

804
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:52,280
it's no longer attracted by

805
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,590
the magnets

806
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:57,010
and the moment that i stopped eating it

807
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:58,940
it will very quickly call

808
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:01,280
we've become ferromagnetic again

809
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:03,650
it will go

810
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:10,760
back just watch it

811
01:08:12,030 --> 01:08:13,720
out again ferromagnetic

812
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:19,760
so the transition is extremely short

813
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:25,880
all right

814
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,450
so paramagnetic materials

815
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:36,010
as i mentioned several times in general cannot hang on the mac

816
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:39,150
the attractive force is there's not enough

817
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:41,110
to handle the magnetic force

818
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:42,630
has to be larger than

819
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:44,760
its own weight

820
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:48,070
and dynamic minute materials is of course completely out

821
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,900
because diamagnetic materials always post

822
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,950
the weak part of the field

823
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:58,760
it's only paramagnetic materials and ferromagnetic materials that experience force

824
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:04,050
the strong part of the field if the field itself is not uniform

825
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,190
now there is one

826
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:06,760
very interesting

827
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:11,360
i want to draw your attention to

828
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:14,340
this transparency here

829
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:15,690
look here at

830
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:18,550
oxygen at one atmosphere

831
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:22,510
oxygen one atmosphere and three hundred degrees kelvin

832
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:24,090
as the value for

833
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:27,800
i of and which is two times ten to the minus six

834
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:30,900
now look at liquid oxygen

835
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:35,340
the you that is that

836
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:41,960
you by

837
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:51,070
so it's going to

838
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:59,530
so of course

839
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:08,390
so i or

840
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:09,750
something like that

841
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,960
i was not always like

842
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,240
the that species

843
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,400
not of

844
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:50,120
later on these

845
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:53,140
but in

846
01:10:53,160 --> 01:11:00,470
what i like to say that

847
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,200
one the best

848
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:16,300
you are you

849
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:42,670
so the the

850
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,350
for the last ten years

851
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,170
so the

852
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:59,020
one of

853
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,990
one i one

854
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:09,500
wouldn't what

855
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:12,610
it is

856
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:21,790
so is

857
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:31,720
one is

858
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:33,030
so way

859
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,710
that's why we

860
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:56,580
one gene expression

861
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:57,870
this is

862
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:14,260
so last

863
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:24,530
rule one

864
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,650
that was long

865
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:35,520
one of

866
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:38,340
long as

867
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:41,230
so one

868
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:45,190
he played

869
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:01,570
it's not

870
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:13,190
one of the prime but my analysis and its involved

871
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,610
no reason

872
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,250
so what we look like

873
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,240
one class

874
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,880
has it

875
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,460
was the first

876
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,840
well sometimes you know

877
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:11,910
one is i saddle after the

878
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:16,730
let me just give you the the level message the high-level messages that belief propagation

879
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:21,480
is working on this problem when all of these rows are equal to one

880
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:25,500
and with that setting that's not a convex problem in general it's very easy to

881
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:29,870
make me multiple fixed points you can make belief propagation oscillate

882
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:33,810
it turns out that if you do something quite simple if you choose these rose

883
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:38,000
in a somewhat different way you can always guarantee that you get a convex problem

884
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,210
and you can always therefore unique optimum of message passing

885
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:46,020
and the way in which you do it some theory behind this but just to

886
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:48,000
give you the flavor

887
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:52,230
you're essentially just and you want to think about this experiment

888
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:55,100
let's imagine that have a giant had

889
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:57,770
you have a graph

890
01:16:57,830 --> 01:17:02,850
in general has cycles and i take all the trees that you can extract from

891
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:04,520
the graph the many of them

892
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:08,790
so here if you look at that graph showing three trees

893
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:12,000
if you take all of these trees and

894
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:16,450
put them in a had you can imagine sort of drawing the tree out at

895
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,270
and then you can ask

896
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:22,580
if i look at some edge how likely is that edge to appear in that

897
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:23,870
tree that i just

898
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:25,930
took at random out of the a hat

899
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:27,710
it's going to be happy

900
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:29,060
take up the tree

901
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,310
how often does an edge appear

902
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:35,120
so in this case this at for instance that has to be in every tree

903
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:38,250
you can remove this and still have the spanning tree

904
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:40,750
this edge here

905
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:44,680
only appears inferences two out of three of the trees that would have a weight

906
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:45,890
of two thirds

907
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:49,870
and this edge here would appear in one third of the trees

908
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:52,060
so it turns out if you use

909
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:55,830
numbers that are generated in this way they belong to what is called the spanning

910
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:57,370
tree polytope

911
01:17:57,390 --> 01:18:02,230
then in fact you get a convex problem you can prove convergence guarantees together a

912
01:18:02,230 --> 01:18:06,980
reweighted form of belief propagation to improve convergence guarantees and

913
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,810
various things for some advantage here is that you now have convexified the problem is

914
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:16,450
not much different than belief propagation but in general this algorithm tends to have a

915
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:22,000
much more stable it's provably stable and has much better convergence properties

916
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:28,680
another thing that you can do again just give you a high-level flavor because you

917
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:33,890
know have this perspective that things like belief propagation are based on the two ingredients

918
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:40,180
entropy approximation and approximating the constraints that there's nothing to stop you from using quite

919
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:42,100
different kinds of constraints

920
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:46,830
right i don't have to stick with linear constraints like i had here

921
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:51,980
and one kind of constraint is actually very useful to use semi definite constraints to

922
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:57,680
further restricting the form of the moments

923
01:18:57,690 --> 01:19:01,250
so the idea here is that whenever you have a moment matrix it looks like

924
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:06,080
this just looks like a galaxy in case but i'm not we're not thinking about

925
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,850
gaussians writing about discrete cases

926
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:13,500
discrete cases have to satisfy semi definite constraints as well

927
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:18,370
and if you impose constraints are actually putting you're using an infinite number of

928
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:22,190
hyperplanes cutting it many many times

929
01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:25,040
and just to show you the sort of power of this

930
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:29,540
let's go back to this example that i had before

931
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:34,560
where we had these things that belief propagation is perfectly happy with right this example

932
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,210
the setting

933
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:40,430
but if i take these guys i extract for instance mu one mu mu two

934
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:43,640
mu three that point five point five point five

935
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:49,160
these are the cross terms point four point four point one so i put that

936
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:55,160
in this matrix if you put that amount you find it's not positive semi definite

937
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:57,460
so what this says is that right away this

938
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:03,290
using a semidefinite constraints ruling out something that belief propagation will be fine with

939
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:08,950
so sort of thing here tightening you sharpening your relaxation with extra constraints and in

940
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:13,810
general there's many such constraints you can add and it's not yet really well understood

941
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:19,640
what's best is obviously trade-offs in terms of computation time and accuracy except but this

942
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:23,830
is a whole sort of active area that people are exploring

943
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:27,120
in the last few minutes

944
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:36,160
actually so any questions about those two particular examples before i discovered the last thing

945
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:42,160
just to recap the high-level message here is that you can convexified basically any

946
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:48,330
basically any variational method not mean field style but any one of these outer styles

947
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:54,790
beta kikuchi its expectation propagation they all can be convexified and in my personal opinion

948
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:59,390
they all should be convexified i don't think you really have an excuse for solving

949
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:03,370
a non convex problem when there's something that's close by and convex it will be

950
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:04,540
much more stable

951
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:11,120
i give a strong vote personally for convexification

952
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:13,870
any questions and about

953
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:18,060
this particular segment

954
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,080
probably people are fairly tired

955
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:31,790
and sentenced to military conditions that phenomenon called long term potentiation LTP

956
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:37,640
in fact there will a few more eyes

957
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:43,460
he discovered all the phenomenon called rock on the question can also manipulate

958
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:48,640
on synapse in such a way that you can get reduced

959
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:50,560
if you see

960
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:53,140
of synaptic transmission but in any case

961
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:54,600
this right shows

962
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:55,830
that is

963
01:21:58,090 --> 01:22:01,950
it's not the strings the y axis in the case

964
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:05,530
it is indeed because all

965
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:09,320
the strength of the set of steps

966
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:12,240
the x axis is the kind of recording

967
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,510
and this is the basal level of

968
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:20,900
and then you do something to this that this is not five

969
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:21,740
and they need

970
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,540
if to go to the top of the simple down but it does go back

971
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:29,010
to the this horrible state the higher level

972
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:33,820
four of the sixty minutes in this fix this can last for many many weeks

973
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:37,270
the probably many months later maybe

974
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:39,000
i think the synapse available

975
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:44,090
was substantiated by by this pp discovery

976
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:46,690
but as i said earlier

977
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:49,070
memory processes

978
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:55,040
very likely to be not the same thing but it's the phenomenon of ensemble

979
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:59,980
neurons forming a network in which it

980
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,500
but it was in the city the synapses

981
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,580
if this is all

982
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:06,650
how do you

983
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:08,510
how do demonstrate

984
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:10,500
this ensemble

985
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:13,240
synapse phenomenon of memory traces

986
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:14,510
here comes

987
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:18,170
my colleague mike woodson

988
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:24,270
we're not going to give you but i think he is listed for the

989
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:27,190
the two are this afternoon i do

990
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:33,690
look at his facility with one and you can see here

991
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:36,370
it's actually the mouse

992
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:39,330
and in the electrodes

993
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:41,480
in countries such

994
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:46,310
and it's not the same electoral onto the road microelectrodes

995
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:49,010
in proc the deep inside the brain

996
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:51,650
and the tip if in the hippocampus

997
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:56,050
and in this specific area we can call this year one area from which we

998
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:57,780
were going to be

999
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:02,980
as free the animals recover from surgery

1000
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:03,990
an animal

1001
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:10,520
now if we allow the rules in the mind that they have this going on

1002
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:13,120
this is connected to computer

1003
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:17,530
and in the computer will spit out a moment moment the activity of

1004
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:20,760
a set of CA one hippocampal neurons

1005
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:23,430
and animal allowed to

1006
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:28,730
acquired the memory of specific space this a you coming here this morning we will

1007
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,130
hear that yesterday

1008
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:33,560
and you have my wrong wrong before

1009
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:39,780
you have already acquired the feature all this particular rule this space

1010
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:43,380
spatial memory so the simulator to that allows

1011
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:47,690
road can do that in fact this is something very important for them you have

1012
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:52,670
to know that the southern india is very dangerous because the possible cats

1013
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:58,810
and the idea is important because it for some time ago and the song so

1014
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:06,690
what that

1015
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:07,960
with this idea

1016
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:11,900
explore a specific and in space

1017
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:18,620
and the former memory therefore memory of the space and as these memory form

1018
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:21,520
simultaneously in real time

1019
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:23,630
for all change

1020
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:28,660
of the bunch of neurons in the hippocampus

1021
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:32,670
and they come up with a very very intriguing

1022
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:34,980
and on

1023
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:39,070
i would say i i will try to explain which ones right

1024
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:41,780
eighty boxes each box

1025
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:45,000
if the present one neuron in this

1026
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:47,210
pyramidal cells of CA models

1027
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:48,740
o thing right

1028
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:50,310
and also

1029
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:51,530
it's square

1030
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:59,540
pop number over space which is about one point five metre

1031
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:01,770
in one edge

1032
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:06,590
and then the activity of neurons

1033
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:10,210
it to how it indicated by red

1034
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:14,150
and activity rule one and it is indicated by blue

1035
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:17,320
right and at the same time of animal

1036
01:26:17,350 --> 01:26:19,020
explore the space

1037
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:22,210
he has had a video camera on top

1038
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:26,030
and the new money to the actual location of the animal

1039
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:28,240
he commanded without any good

1040
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:30,330
this kind of diagram

1041
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:31,930
so if you look at this cell

1042
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:36,630
active since cell is active when animal

1043
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:39,510
it in the middle of the space

1044
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:44,070
when i go to provide this way what that way or that way it doesn't

1045
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:49,820
matter that he comes to decide which is the specific location in the environment

1046
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:53,180
the this five

1047
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:58,870
if you take the identify in the middle of the space but it by a

1048
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,530
o upon in this time

1049
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:05,930
and the song some cell by doing this fifty minute recording

1050
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:11,700
OK internet cafes is as i've already said this this is a quote from one

1051
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:18,510
of the ideal observer alqaida into a very effective tool use it to disseminate information

1052
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,880
people in afghanistan go across the border and send email

1053
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:24,510
and now they consent

1054
01:27:24,570 --> 01:27:25,740
they can post

1055
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:31,010
the videos have been lauded

1056
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:36,970
all the tax though what could be a lot of people worry about

1057
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:39,320
terrorists actually attacking the internet

1058
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:46,030
so this goes under name of electronic warfare warfare so

1059
01:27:46,050 --> 01:27:48,340
the idea would be that the

1060
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:52,260
terrorist group would sabotage the internet bring down

1061
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:55,890
with the mass effect on the world economy

1062
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:01,530
and then the cycle of these for psychological warfare

1063
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:05,590
ideology et cetera

1064
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,010
so a lot

1065
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:15,050
there's a lot of people extremely worried and tried to protect themselves against attack

1066
01:28:15,070 --> 01:28:18,470
so how would they do that

1067
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:24,160
you need to disrupt communication unit to damage by two hardware

1068
01:28:24,570 --> 01:28:29,390
one thing about the incident is designed to is exactly what it's designed to with

1069
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:33,590
would withstand the internet was this was going to adopt program

1070
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:37,470
so it was designed so that you could take out some links to the internet

1071
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:40,110
it will root itself around

1072
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:44,530
and these are some of the methods that you could do this

1073
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:46,570
you can

1074
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:51,180
electromagnetic pulses these

1075
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:55,090
that is to find out how to get lower or you could attack

1076
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:59,890
you can send worms are hacked hacking into the

1077
01:28:59,930 --> 01:29:02,110
into information systems and so on

1078
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:04,220
this is really

1079
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:06,410
right now

1080
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:10,620
i don't think of myself as the it y with the y would terrorist that

1081
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:12,930
the internet it's useful to them

1082
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:14,070
it doesn't

1083
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:17,090
i think a lot of the worries about

1084
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:20,910
specific attacks on the internet infrastructure are present

1085
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:23,050
what they do definitely

1086
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:26,430
behaving this it's may that a with a

1087
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:28,760
they they

1088
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:34,840
they before that is in the propaganda and information exchange that they really work

1089
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:37,300
this is just an illustration of how

1090
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:41,260
recruitment what happens on this is there is actually examples of this

1091
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:43,240
in in

1092
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:49,470
there is a genus for this this exp terrorists for the jihadi forum

1093
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:52,320
where you have an armchair

1094
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:57,640
it's not active terrorists is is basically going to form is is picking up posting

1095
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:59,110
and responding

1096
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:00,800
he he is

1097
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:06,090
he's talking to some sort of ideal of for the whatever it is and

1098
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:09,140
the ideal put him in touch with the local

1099
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:12,010
o operations guy

1100
01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:15,470
who brings him together with other armchair

1101
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:18,990
she had his first fully connected to the context

1102
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:22,910
and he brings about maybe sense of honour award rafting trip in the

1103
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:25,280
the lake district if you the english one

1104
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:26,590
and then you have your

1105
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:29,930
it's a terrorist cells

1106
01:30:29,950 --> 01:30:34,450
and then they blow up some building

1107
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:36,720
but the the

1108
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:39,180
psychological warfare

1109
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:44,160
well what this is really an outbreak

1110
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:47,640
how terrorists manipulate public opinion pieces

1111
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:50,660
in the western democracies democracies very

1112
01:30:53,780 --> 01:30:57,260
what what does it mean it means you're trying to disrupt or damage what the

1113
01:30:57,260 --> 01:31:03,760
target population knows or thinks it knows about itself make it uncertain makes

1114
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:05,680
get it

1115
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:09,950
the models are particularly vulnerable to that

1116
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:15,320
because we we allow opinions on on different subjects

1117
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:19,070
the true censorship she is almost impossible on the internet we

1118
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:24,990
governments can't control what their citizens use the chinese i got this

1119
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:27,740
this great firewall of china

1120
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:33,700
they have been hundreds of people who are basically adding neurons which are blocked from

1121
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,990
entering the chinese internet

1122
01:31:37,010 --> 01:31:42,270
but it of course they can't really control what is published inside china so the

1123
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:43,510
this is the primal

1124
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,150
wish strive the dual

1125
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:51,230
i take the saddle point equations which detailed by DB equals zero

1126
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:54,850
and that you want to be on this

1127
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:56,040
would give me

1128
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,550
this requirement here

1129
01:31:58,540 --> 01:32:01,680
what i'm actually doing with duality here

1130
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:07,990
i don't know whether a lot of how many people whose

1131
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:14,740
familiarity with optimization that briefly the the primal problem OK

1132
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,240
which perhaps my

1133
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:18,280
primal problem is a quadratic

1134
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:24,110
and the dual problem this is i'm in time problems the john problems i max

1135
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:29,410
time problems and the solution of to the primal and the dual i have exactly

1136
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:32,970
the same solution you can drive one from the other OK that's what i'm trying

1137
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:36,390
to do i do a dual version of this

1138
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,400
which gives me

1139
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:41,420
when solving committees that the same solution

1140
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:45,390
so there might be OK is me this

1141
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:52,720
dl by w actually do a deal by the w that's going to give me

1142
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,180
IW here

1143
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:56,160
could have done the square

1144
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:59,220
it can be done but here is distracted term

1145
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:01,910
and indeed detail by the w

1146
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:02,800
it gives me

1147
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,440
this expression here

1148
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:09,670
which must be satisfied solution of my primal problem

1149
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:13,680
when daylight w the solution this must be the case

1150
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:14,850
now could take w

1151
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:19,750
substitute back in in here

1152
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:23,300
here here and here get the dual solution

1153
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:27,480
OK i'll just do it and then explain this sort of philosophy of this proof

1154
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:30,510
so w goes in there

1155
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:34,930
and if i place w in their naturally the BMW now gone

1156
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:37,510
i get this dual formulation here

1157
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,810
so this is my argument therefore

1158
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:44,660
is from statistical learning theory and must maximize the margin

1159
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:50,360
but i had to strain it so that the primal branch department of the college

1160
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,680
it looks roughly sort of like this

1161
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:56,710
there's always the dual formulation of any problem in optimisation theory

1162
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:00,960
and actually when this but i all the primal problem the solution of the dual

1163
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,370
problem is also does indeed the solution of the problem the problem is still widely

1164
01:34:05,370 --> 01:34:07,990
because zero deal by the w zero

1165
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:12,350
they gave me this requirements so if i'm able to actually go

1166
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:20,150
minimize this expression here then i will arrive at exactly the same solution now

1167
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:22,910
i say here

1168
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,850
so maximizing function maximise the jewel

1169
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,920
it's actually called the wolf tool

1170
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:29,670
which is this expression here

1171
01:34:30,230 --> 01:34:35,330
this actually is the main equation for support vector machines our just cause and have

1172
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:38,530
a look at it before one to do other things

1173
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:43,250
first of all what you notice is the data is coming in here

1174
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:44,700
OK that's the data

1175
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:48,490
xis and the corresponding labels which otherwise

1176
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:53,820
and indeed max task is in terms of the alpha across multipliers

1177
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:59,680
it is actually constrained optimisation because those alpha first must be positive

1178
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:04,510
and indeed is the second constraint which you don't overlook which is constrained here

1179
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:06,450
so it is constrained optimisation

1180
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:12,120
well you'll notice that the important point is my next task alpha

1181
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:17,240
it involves a quadratic programming time across tasks alpha

1182
01:35:17,260 --> 01:35:19,760
and alpha square time special

1183
01:35:19,770 --> 01:35:21,400
so it's a quadratic

1184
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,130
just like here

1185
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:24,270
actually here

1186
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:28,660
and the max is going to have some unique solution

1187
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:34,560
indeed it was sort of ties together because if we consider that max maximally separating

1188
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:39,900
hyperplane i started with you can probably see the only sort of one solution really

1189
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:45,000
and hence i get only one solution to this problem here

1190
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:48,230
so and that is my essential

1191
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:56,050
problem nexus object subject to constraints given

1192
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:57,960
and was for alpha

1193
01:35:57,990 --> 01:36:00,280
and it's called is convex

1194
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,400
only one solution OK

1195
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:06,100
and my data just simply probably data in here

1196
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:13,340
the quadratic programming get my solution because another feature is very efficient algorithms for quadratic

1197
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:18,400
programming so i can handle very large data sets

1198
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:20,410
right so what i do

1199
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:23,650
it is i would solve quadratic programming problem

1200
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:25,670
having got the alphas

1201
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:27,470
i put the office in here

1202
01:36:28,310 --> 01:36:29,740
now initially

1203
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:32,450
but it's not quite true

1204
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:36,530
because typically what they actually do that is they say

1205
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:39,930
it's adjusted for risk

1206
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:54,400
it's clear that some stocks are more vulnerable than others

1207
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:58,570
if you buy stock in electrical utility

1208
01:36:58,570 --> 01:37:03,280
which has guaranteed revenue stream because no matter how bad the economy get

1209
01:37:03,370 --> 01:37:06,880
a lot of people still use electricity

1210
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:10,560
you don't expect it to fluctuate alive

1211
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:11,600
if you buy

1212
01:37:13,660 --> 01:37:16,310
a high-tech company

1213
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:18,620
it sells things on the internet

1214
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:22,360
you might expect it to fluctuate normal it's enormously

1215
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:24,210
or if you buy stock in

1216
01:37:24,230 --> 01:37:25,900
a retailer

1217
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:31,690
you might expect it to go up or down more dramatically with the economy

1218
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:32,950
and so

1219
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:34,590
in fact

1220
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:38,560
is an notion of risk and i'm not going to do this in the simulation

1221
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,500
but usually people have to be paid to take risk

1222
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:44,590
so it's usually the case

1223
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:50,050
but you can get a higher return if you're willing to take more risk

1224
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:53,660
we might or might not have time to come back to that

1225
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,220
more generally the point is

1226
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:03,150
the each stock actually behaves of a little bit differently

1227
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:06,570
there's the distribution of how it would move

1228
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:09,640
so even if on average

1229
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:10,890
the stock

1230
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:14,820
it is expected to not move at all from where it starts

1231
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:16,750
some stocks

1232
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:21,920
you will be expected to just trundle along without much change

1233
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:23,890
not very valuable

1234
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:26,580
another stocks

1235
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,410
my jump up and down the line

1236
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:33,210
because they're very vulnerable even if the expected value is

1237
01:38:33,230 --> 01:38:34,220
the same

1238
01:38:34,230 --> 01:38:37,550
it move around a lot

1239
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:41,100
so how can we model this kind of thing what we've already looked at the

1240
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:44,120
basic notion

1241
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:47,600
last time we looked at the notion of last lecture we looked at the idea

1242
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,640
of the distribution

1243
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:53,540
and we

1244
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:56,590
do is simulation were pulling the samples

1245
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,600
from some distribution

1246
01:39:00,610 --> 01:39:01,660
it could be

1247
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:05,910
that would be a gaussians

1248
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:08,560
we're if you recall there was i mean

1249
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,680
and the standard deviation

1250
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:16,750
most values we're going to be close to the mean

1251
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:21,540
especially if there is a small standard deviation if there's a large standard deviation would

1252
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:23,540
be spread

1253
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:28,140
or it could be uniform where every value was equally probable we also look at

1254
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:32,350
so we're going to

1255
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:35,540
assigned to each stock when we created

1256
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:38,430
eight distribution

1257
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:40,070
some way of

1258
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:42,580
visualizing are thinking about

1259
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:47,630
where we draw the price changes from

1260
01:39:47,630 --> 01:39:49,520
this gets us into

1261
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:53,820
a new linguistic concept

1262
01:39:53,830 --> 01:39:56,250
which will see

1263
01:39:56,300 --> 01:40:00,230
down here you don't have this particular code on your handouts

1264
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:03,530
you do the code that uses the same concept

1265
01:40:03,550 --> 01:40:06,710
so here's my unit test procedure

1266
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:12,520
and here's what i'm going to create distributions and i'm going to look at two

1267
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:13,790
a random

1268
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:17,210
are uniform in the gaussians

1269
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:19,390
what landed does

1270
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,480
is it creates

1271
01:40:21,490 --> 01:40:22,820
on the fly

1272
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:24,050
a function

1273
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:26,440
as the program runs

1274
01:40:26,530 --> 01:40:30,370
that i can then pass around

1275
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,640
so here

1276
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:36,950
i'm going to look at the thing random that uniform for example

1277
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,440
between minus volatility in plus volatility

1278
01:40:40,490 --> 01:40:42,500
so ignoring the land

1279
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:46,500
what do we expect random but uniform to do

1280
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:49,880
it has

1281
01:40:49,930 --> 01:40:54,790
equally likely in the range from minus volatility to plus volatility

1282
01:40:54,830 --> 01:41:02,640
it will return any value in here

1283
01:41:02,690 --> 01:41:05,290
but notice the previous slide

1284
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:09,810
where i am computing volatility

1285
01:41:09,810 --> 01:41:14,390
that this phase velocity even goes to infinity

1286
01:41:14,390 --> 01:41:16,770
now you know

1287
01:41:16,810 --> 01:41:18,850
that there is no problem

1288
01:41:18,890 --> 01:41:20,730
there is no energy flowing

1289
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:24,250
was that speed is no different from the water

1290
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:26,460
in fact the energy flow

1291
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,310
it was the group velocity

1292
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:29,560
which is

1293
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:31,440
the group velocity

1294
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:33,290
is the omega

1295
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:35,000
the case

1296
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:39,250
and that was always less than c should perhaps remember

1297
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:40,870
not zero again getting

1298
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:45,920
my enthusiasm get carried away is less than c

1299
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:51,000
and remember at the cutoff frequency were no longer radiation would go through

1300
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:57,100
this phase velocity went to infinity and the group velocity went to zero

1301
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:03,210
i have fulfilled the promise to those of you who couldn't sleep

1302
01:42:03,270 --> 01:42:04,890
i tell you that the meaning

1303
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:07,330
of phase velocity is larger than c

1304
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:08,560
and that's all

1305
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:11,730
there's nothing wrong with it you have it was what are you have to make

1306
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:17,150
you have admitted electromagnetic radiation you cannot transport any mass was that space

1307
01:42:17,210 --> 01:42:19,370
you cannot transport any

1308
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:21,480
energy with that's speech

1309
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:23,390
so there's nothing

1310
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:25,080
obscene about

1311
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:28,670
very straight

1312
01:42:28,670 --> 01:42:31,500
and i want to do a demonstration

1313
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:33,580
show you that

1314
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:38,350
waves can be linearly polarized

1315
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:39,650
next lecture

1316
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:41,250
we will discuss how we

1317
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:43,710
generate electromagnetic waves

1318
01:42:43,770 --> 01:42:47,040
we do not by accelerating charges

1319
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:49,540
in this case the electron

1320
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:53,310
and i have your transmitter

1321
01:42:53,370 --> 01:42:55,730
this is an antenna

1322
01:42:55,730 --> 01:42:58,850
through which we are going to oscillate current

1323
01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:00,710
the frequency of eighty

1324
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:04,290
so f

1325
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:11,060
so the wavelength lambda

1326
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:14,920
it is about three point seven five meters

1327
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:16,730
the wavelength

1328
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:18,730
it is the speed of light

1329
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:20,830
divided by the frequency

1330
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:24,770
out to be about three point seven five meters

1331
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:30,620
and as we oscillate eighty million times per second back and forth electrons in

1332
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:31,750
isn't enough

1333
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:35,330
that means the current going back and forth

1334
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:40,040
electromagnetic radiation is produced the next lecture you what exactly see how much

1335
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:42,080
and why

1336
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:44,750
and that electromagnetic radiation

1337
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:49,170
is polarized in this direction linearly that should not surprise you

1338
01:43:49,190 --> 01:43:53,020
if the intent is like this and the electrons move like this should not surprise

1339
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:54,210
you but you will see

1340
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:58,810
next to say why it is linearly polarized is correct

1341
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:02,040
and here i have a receiving antenna

1342
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:05,000
this is the copper wire

1343
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,520
which is cut in half

1344
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,650
and where the two

1345
01:44:11,190 --> 01:44:13,000
roads connect

1346
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:14,960
there's a light bulb

1347
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:19,650
any current that flows in you must go through the libel

1348
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:22,310
when i turn on this transmitter

1349
01:44:22,330 --> 01:44:23,620
i want to show you

1350
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:25,670
that as long as i hold this

1351
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:27,980
receiving antenna like this

1352
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:30,390
i will see these lights go out

1353
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:31,690
but when i do this

1354
01:44:31,710 --> 01:44:33,000
i want

1355
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:38,580
because electromagnetic radiation if you goes like this is going to slosh current in year

1356
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:40,890
with the frequency in megahertz

1357
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:42,170
and the life goal

1358
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:45,920
but when i do it like this the electric field is like this so

1359
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:48,390
there is no current flowing in this direction

1360
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:51,730
so this is a dramatic way of demonstrating

1361
01:44:53,210 --> 01:44:56,040
there is such a thing as linearly polarized

1362
01:44:57,690 --> 01:45:01,870
what we decided on the lights we going to to right

1363
01:45:01,890 --> 01:45:06,770
made target we possibly could

1364
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:09,830
so here's the transmitter and

1365
01:45:09,890 --> 01:45:12,940
and here is the receiver

1366
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:16,940
and i'm holding it like this and you see that i'm receiving a signal

1367
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:20,120
so does the current sloshing back and forth

1368
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:22,290
and the light is on

1369
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:26,870
and now it's all very field comes in like this

1370
01:45:26,890 --> 01:45:31,170
the lights stuff like i don't see current going through

1371
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:34,540
it does

1372
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:37,370
but this is sensitive to the polarization

1373
01:45:37,390 --> 01:45:39,440
o of the incoming signal

1374
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:40,810
when i go a little bit

1375
01:45:40,830 --> 01:45:43,250
to this site

1376
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:49,440
as we just saw electromagnetic radiation if you must be always perpendicular to the direction

1377
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:54,870
of propagation so direction of propagation always in this direction so that's why i hold

1378
01:45:54,870 --> 01:45:57,080
it like this for maximum effect

1379
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:59,120
because now he feels is like this

1380
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:01,790
whereas in the field is like this

1381
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:03,650
how do you feel is like this

1382
01:46:03,670 --> 01:46:05,870
and the light is not bright

1383
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:08,390
you will see to say why

1384
01:46:08,440 --> 01:46:10,640
but clearly when i do this

1385
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:14,580
first nothing and because of the linear polarisation

1386
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:16,420
of the electromagnetic radiation

1387
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:19,370
so what

1388
01:46:19,390 --> 01:46:22,290
come to close it will actually if i come to close to this you my

1389
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:23,190
love that

1390
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:25,060
the light will go

1391
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:26,390
will burn alive

1392
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:27,750
you want to see that

1393
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:33,080
OK so i'm going to call the hierarchical clustering today it's

1394
01:46:33,130 --> 01:46:38,440
be quite kind level view i think that's probably like you can probably have

1395
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:41,540
whole conferences on high hierarchical clustering because

1396
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:46,360
that's all sorts of hierarchical clustering algorithms out there and this is really kind of

1397
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:50,570
like a little idiosyncratic journey through hierarchical clustering landscape

1398
01:46:50,570 --> 01:46:53,110
so i have to tell you about a few

1399
01:46:53,130 --> 01:46:58,110
of the more popular ones in the field hierarchical clustering algorithms which i think is

1400
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:07,950
neil has said that i'm kind of bayesian so

1401
01:47:07,970 --> 01:47:12,260
in the going to start with the traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms and then slowly move

1402
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:16,740
towards more and more bees things as we as the public

1403
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:22,910
so let's start with hierarchical representation i think this morning neil has told you about

1404
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:28,230
representing data with like nonlinear

1405
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:33,360
manifold right so dimensionality reduction linear and nonlinear manifolds

1406
01:47:33,370 --> 01:47:39,610
so another very popular way representing data is using hierarchies so representing data using trees

1407
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:44,660
so and basically there's many different types of data that has a hierarchical nature so

1408
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:45,890
for example in

1409
01:47:45,970 --> 01:47:48,310
natural language processing you might want to

1410
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:52,170
represent sentences english sentences using its posture

1411
01:47:52,190 --> 01:47:57,530
so each of the interior nodes of dissenters corresponds to a little phrase

1412
01:47:57,580 --> 01:47:59,520
which describes that part of the centre

1413
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:04,340
and the what's come the the leaves of the tree basically

1414
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:09,200
so another example of hierarchical representations is in

1415
01:48:09,250 --> 01:48:11,980
so here count showing you a little

1416
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:14,640
drawing i got from the internet of

1417
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:16,780
the language tree of the wall so

1418
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:19,530
languages at the leaves of the tree

1419
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:20,440
and then

1420
01:48:20,450 --> 01:48:23,030
the tree itself health describes

1421
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:28,000
the evolutionary history of languages how languages develop and change and spin off from each

1422
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:30,770
so it's kind of

1423
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:34,060
also hierarchical representation of what i believe

1424
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:35,440
actually happened

1425
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,370
in the past

1426
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:43,250
so another example of hierarchical representations is in

1427
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:46,160
phylogenetic trees so

1428
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:49,750
i hope that i think all of us believe in evolution

1429
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:54,760
and if you do believe in evolution that you do believe that you know all

1430
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:56,560
of life on earth came

1431
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:58,400
count evolved

1432
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:00,630
from one single source and that

1433
01:49:00,690 --> 01:49:03,910
if you look at race trudy hands

1434
01:49:04,090 --> 01:49:09,910
evolutionary history of these species then you you basically get the evolutionary tree

1435
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:11,250
which describes

1436
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:14,410
the relationships among all the living organisms on earth

1437
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:20,120
still more examples so here

1438
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:23,340
we don't necessarily believe that

1439
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:26,290
out of the data we see actually has

1440
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:30,030
and the underlying hierarchical structure but will still like two

1441
01:49:30,070 --> 01:49:34,470
somehow represent data in hierarchical manner to visualize it better

1442
01:49:34,490 --> 01:49:36,680
so here i a little

1443
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:38,430
dataset in which you have

1444
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:45,060
micro array data in which you have patients cancer patients and they you genes

1445
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:46,350
and each little

1446
01:49:46,370 --> 01:49:51,090
square here tells you how much that gene was expressed in the patient

1447
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:53,310
you might want to

1448
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:55,760
cluster the patients

1449
01:49:55,780 --> 01:50:01,160
in social way that it might be informative about for example which stage

1450
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:03,810
of cancer the patient has

1451
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:07,630
so this might be the stage one cancers patients and this are the stage treatment

1452
01:50:07,630 --> 01:50:09,070
cancer patients who wants

1453
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:11,650
you see that this counts so relationships

1454
01:50:11,690 --> 01:50:15,030
that's being extracted that's being

1455
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:18,410
extracted by the tree

1456
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:22,280
and on the side of the genes you might want to have some

1457
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:27,090
hierarchical representation of the genes such that genes which are more similar to each other

1458
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:29,280
in terms of the expression levels

1459
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:33,870
put in the same part of the tree

1460
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:36,060
do more examples

1461
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:40,160
so in in image processing and signal processing you might

1462
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:44,350
the images the signals using

1463
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:48,230
things like what reason with decompositions so here

1464
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:50,880
we have an image like this and if we

1465
01:50:50,930 --> 01:50:53,810
we can model this image as

1466
01:50:53,810 --> 01:50:56,560
it follows we start off with the whole picture

1467
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,870
we split it into four quarters

1468
01:50:58,870 --> 01:51:01,000
and then within each quarter

1469
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:03,060
if the

1470
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:06,290
image within that quarter is not

1471
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:08,000
is not uniform

1472
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,430
then we we keep on spitting it can recursively splitting until

1473
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:15,110
within each little region here

1474
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:18,170
image is basically of a uniform

1475
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:20,310
colour of

1476
01:51:20,370 --> 01:51:21,310
gray scale

1477
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:23,400
distribution i this

1478
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:30,570
in this talk october high hierarchical clustering so the idea

1479
01:51:30,580 --> 01:51:34,390
is that if you have some data which comes in in this form

1480
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:36,350
and you believe that they

1481
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:37,650
is cluster

1482
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:39,460
so you it comes from

1483
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:40,710
it comes

1484
01:51:41,390 --> 01:51:44,850
they that can be described as a whole bunch of clusters so you might want

1485
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:48,190
ask the here and the clusters that another cost that

1486
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:53,080
but within each class you might still you might believe that the cluster also has

1487
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:55,850
some sort of internal structure in which you could

1488
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:58,650
model with sub clusters

1489
01:51:58,700 --> 01:51:59,980
so now if you

1490
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:01,150
OK you

1491
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:05,580
at the data is split into clusters within each cluster is split into sub clusters

1492
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:08,800
so that's basically hierarchical representation of your data

1493
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:09,550
so that

1494
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:12,690
these two the notion of hierarchical clustering

1495
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:20,550
so what hierarchical so that's what i'm going to be talking about today so one

1496
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:23,770
of the uses of hierarchical clustering does i think probably

1497
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:26,000
a few important users

1498
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:29,790
some of which i describe here

1499
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:33,010
so firstly is very useful in terms of visualizing data

1500
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:34,000
right so

1501
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:39,490
given a set of patients we might cluster the patients into

1502
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:41,760
p into
