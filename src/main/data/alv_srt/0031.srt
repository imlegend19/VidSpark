1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
with this guy and I get a factor e to the minus 6 times in

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,300
from the exponential loss

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,210
but that has nothing to do with the integral is a constant as far as

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,390
the integrals concern because it doesn't involve T 1 and therefore I can pull it

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:22,630
outside of the integral sign and right that e to the minus finds a right

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:29,210
times the integral of 1 well e to the negative

7
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,390
you T 1

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,750
at 15 1 the

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:47,090
still integrated from minus the including affinity and now the final step this U of

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,220
T 1 is year-old for negative values of T

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,940
and therefore

12
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,440
it's equal to 1

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,260
for positive values of T is equal to zero for negative values of T which

14
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,150
means I can forget about the part of the integral that goes from negative 8

15
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,150
is 0

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,940
I better rewrite this efficiently than in other words this is equal to unity a

17
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,870
minus A times the integral from 0 to infinity of even the minus

18
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,250
OK let me do the shifty part

19
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:34,350
so I that we can do that

20
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,900
but that's since you of T 1 is equal to 0 4

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,070
negative values for is equal to 0 for less that that's why I can replace

22
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,940
this with 0 because from negative 8 is 0 nothing is happening the integrand is

23
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,940
0 and why can I get rid of it after that will because as 1

24
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,590
after that

25
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,720
and what's

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,590
this is will plus transform

27
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,850
now is not all plus transform they said because you had T when they're not

28
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,180
to error

29
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,350
it's all plus transform because this a dummy variability when I and is integrated out

30
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,230
to W variable it doesn't matter what you call it is still plus transform make

31
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,970
that we delete T or T star or

32
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,260
where you've psychical anything want and it's still global plus transform

33
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,890
so what's the answer therefore it so that's e to the negative AS times all

34
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,660
plus transform of function

35
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,210
that's what I promised uniform

36
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,590
now how about the other formula well let's look at that quickly but that's as

37
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,750
they say is a sleight of hand

38
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,150
of but since that's the formula you'll be using at least half the time you

39
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,440
better learn

40
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,830
but this little sleight of hand is also reproduce no 1 page of notes that

41
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,740
I give you but maybe you'll find it easier to understand if by talking allowed

42
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,180
so the problem now is for the 2nd formula what is

43
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,940
I need to know what the

44
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,490
look at the battery copy of the first one in order to make the argument

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,830
the form which you'll understand

46
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,050
so this goes to you the minus a after that

47
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,220
except I'm now going to write that not in effervescence I will not be able

48
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,650
to write the 2nd formula using events and that going to write it right the

49
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:49,240
1st formula we all alright as will plus transform the now formally

50
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,660
somebody said OK calculate all plus transform of this thing

51
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,910
I say put down this will has no t it it doesn't have the affinity

52
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:07,130
they're just then right this what formal I did I do I looked at that

53
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,790
you can figure out well you the better metric

54
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,450
and you can then the better metric you can then compute the score for the

55
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,600
and then you can see doesn't correlate better with human judgments are not so actually

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,780
machine translation evaluation

57
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,490
it's a very well-defined tasks

58
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,430
we have no several corpora annotated with human judgments of sentences

59
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,030
how what they are available since

60
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,680
they all these competitions and mt

61
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,850
you can download one of these different corpora

62
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,440
and you can come up with your own metric see correlate better than

63
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,770
the official metrics that are use

64
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,370
OK let me say a few more things to the blue so that the two

65
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,450
i want to point out where

66
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,940
thanks don't correlate well at all

67
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,670
so this is an example from two thousand five

68
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,840
so you this versus the nist evaluation of arabic english this kind of the most

69
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,090
popular contests

70
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:12,610
americans we love to translate arabic is very fond of arabic and the

71
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,900
they have every you know competition where

72
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,690
i want people to translate arabic and people both statistical MT machine systems basically sort

73
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,050
of different groups participating in that and you have the blue one and

74
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,240
and you have human gesture on the other hand and you see that one outlier

75
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,820
actually correlates pretty well except for the one of finding outliers

76
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,440
so that was that point

77
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,030
a graduate student at the university of edinburgh

78
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,990
who read the rules and said

79
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,880
well it doesn't actually say anywhere in the rules that humans can take the output

80
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,030
of the two system to fix it up

81
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,550
it's definitely not in the spirit of the game and he was very

82
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:54,100
explicit about and he admitted offers some people called cheating

83
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,410
but what happened the one system is just humans looking at the output

84
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,040
you know

85
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,640
english speakers in a number the nothing about arabic but they know what makes sense

86
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,790
in english

87
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,530
so it's not surprisingly that that these systems could very high fluency ranking before the

88
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,480
perfect because there's always someone is about better

89
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,920
judge of what is good english and what is a good translation and next

90
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,420
and i also got a very high edit pursuing

91
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,180
because sometimes you just

92
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,620
you know what the text is about can fill in the missing gaps

93
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,760
and you can put things until

94
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,950
you know things which are much more sense

95
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,800
it's also true that if humans reading flow in sentence so much more convinced that

96
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,630
it has the right meaning

97
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,530
even if it actually has some states

98
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,150
so that that's interesting outlier so this is

99
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,620
system that humans be like a lot

100
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,970
but the blues but doesn't like

101
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,790
OK that's a bit of things

102
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,440
he became across another example

103
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,140
and that's when we want to compare our cities counties systems for the best thing

104
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,630
out there which is commercial software model is that we thought so

105
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:09,030
the most popular system more commercially successful system machine translation

106
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,130
from any language pairs sister

107
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,110
company in france california

108
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,370
we translated text on the european parliament so we have a huge corpus course

109
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,070
the european parliament text we can learn machine translation systems

110
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,150
and people to define machine translation systems one good one

111
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,310
and one bad one it's very easy to build that he system so the trick

112
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,930
is to just use percent of the training data and of course you can do

113
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,540
and if you look at the two in SMT systems that kind of one that

114
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,910
diagonal that you want so the court systems is judged better by humans and by

115
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,230
the automatic metrics

116
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,260
but there

117
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,050
rule based system here this

118
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,150
gets just really harshly worse than all of that and he system by the automatic

119
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,690
but such

120
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,540
highly almost as high as opposed to the system by humans

121
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,850
so that's that's of course are concerned

122
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:14,120
so we have completely figure out why that is we noticed one thing that this

123
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,280
the rule based system of strong outliers

124
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,050
much more if you test in domain if you have a certain corpus and you

125
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,240
system runs all the right jargon and all the right words while the rule based

126
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,340
system might

127
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,880
say the same thing but uses different words

128
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,600
and of course that gets

129
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,800
punished them by the automatic metrics because you don't match exactly the right thing so

130
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,180
some mistakes that system makes sense of the european parliament

131
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,390
real mistakes so when you're for the enlargement of the european union

132
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,440
the system always has the widening of the european union

133
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,310
that does sound funny

134
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,440
but many of the things that the perfectly good words and good translations

135
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,440
so we think part of the answer is that

136
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,960
the automaton that is a little bit too literal you have to get their the

137
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,140
jargon right not just the word the

138
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,870
meaning right

139
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,190
and it's bit too sensitive to that

140
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,130
but it's actually still

141
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,780
so all of the main that that

142
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,830
problem shows up as well

143
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,080
so that's not all of the answer but that's interesting question but the nice thing

144
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,810
about this is a very well defined problem now so a few several corporal who

145
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:27,440
based on statistical systems are judged by humans have the automatic scores you can come

146
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,030
up with the metric that doesn't have these problems

147
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,680
and other that's definitely humans are very sensitive to

148
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,720
things being produced

149
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,450
things being very fluid and that that that does not only

150
00:09:53,460 --> 00:10:02,220
in fact influence adjustment also biases that expresses just more or

151
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,960
yeah not really enough if you actually want people this question to the idea and

152
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,210
people say well the different version of the blues causing the some versions are much

153
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,610
more biased towards the so arguably if you just look at how many were said

154
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,870
to get right

155
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,340
that's more biased with adequacy but if you look for fourgrams

156
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:28,370
the new more biased towards fluency because you can produce fluent grams

157
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,540
so that was

158
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:40,520
so this is not a single reference translation he had four stations

159
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,910
well sort of

160
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,870
smaller or more

161
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,110
so so we often driven by necessity

162
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,270
so very often we only have one reference translation available so for certain been involved

163
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,470
in organizing

164
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,640
you know european language translation competitions

165
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,490
and what you do you take part of the training data sets test set don't

166
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,720
use for training and then you only have one reference sensation for the next revelation

167
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,200
there was produced for reference translation

168
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,740
please go to the third one from these other and

169
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,450
you get it on this

170
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,010
where w are you get to the point that of one

171
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:31,990
and it

172
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,160
all right

173
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,200
many it your way around

174
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,260
if you were

175
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,740
why don't directly

176
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,740
morning unless you gone

177
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,070
this is something that we don't have any real valued

178
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:46,990
and it

179
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,010
correct and valid and in practice the value eight

180
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,370
might be something like twenty o five

181
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,930
and additional work to get twenty drawn from this distribution

182
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,800
is quite helpful and not much work for example use adaptive rejection sampling

183
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,970
you if you're using a rejection rule

184
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,410
the first points in green

185
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:17,030
of an adaptive rejection sampling has the property that you get another minus one point

186
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,090
at almost no cost or all the work with

187
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,930
consumed in getting the on any other one week

188
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,430
is very very cheap and it may well

189
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,450
improve your random walk behavior

190
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,090
up guarantee that it is work on

191
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,840
and the basis of their local blogs

192
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,760
the whole inference using sampling

193
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,410
and but it's been around for about fifteen or twenty years now

194
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,740
way layer implemented sampling of all

195
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,070
these are different models used by the model

196
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,450
using a simple declarative language

197
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,470
and then it figured out how to run

198
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,160
and i'm pretty sure that the the but right now all the ordered pair

199
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,090
ordered overrelaxation built into them

200
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,450
so you can get this

201
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,800
speedup for three point in that that's it

202
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,450
using bugs

203
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,220
we've been going for an hour

204
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,590
so we just carry on with these advanced methods showed only the right

205
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,220
but what's going

206
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,590
start new

207
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,640
and now like to move on to the question about dependence on parameters

208
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:39,740
the vanilla

209
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,300
the trouble is that we talking about

210
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,930
use a gas in distribution somewhere and the with which were crucially important we want it to be

211
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,850
as big as possible and no bigger

212
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,540
when we use hamiltonian monte carlo there are similar but rather

213
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,930
gibbs sampling doesn't have any parameters which means that maybe like it

214
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,420
but if sampling only works if you've got a problem where you know how to draw

215
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,350
from the conditional distribution

216
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,630
and it may be that you are in a world where you just have a

217
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,250
clue how do the energy function is too complicated you can evaluate it you can't

218
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,870
draw from this distribution

219
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:28,320
it would be nice to have a automatically discovers result right the size

220
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,790
and that's what like sampling

221
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,160
we all know that

222
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,380
why something

223
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,760
slice sampling was invented by two people

224
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,210
rapid now

225
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,200
and it's very

226
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:15,670
amazingly simple looking way of the problem that simply can imagine schoolchild

227
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,570
and then in the end you might say

228
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,840
put up work

229
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,160
so let me show you

230
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,370
by sampling

231
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,130
all the first order

232
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,290
this little red one dimensional distribution idea quite something

233
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,040
if you can do it in many dimensions by doing one moment in time just like you have

234
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,640
but it's not like you pick a single by mentioned working

235
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,030
or a single direction be any direction you want in your or you can use

236
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,470
a new

237
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,540
you the math that i'm going to describe in one dimension

238
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,070
and then repeat in other dimensions

239
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,110
so his ideas

240
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,010
we have

241
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,750
and that's the red region

242
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,920
and we have a current location

243
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,840
it will collect it

244
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,490
and i'm not going to describe to you how we get the next location with

245
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:23,850
the first one

246
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,340
and it can be quite

247
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,820
a few steps so

248
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,210
that all you read

249
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,610
at the current location

250
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,180
we evaluate each stock

251
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,920
this a graph is not

252
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,040
then we

253
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,590
we draw a point uniformly between here

254
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,790
you start at x

255
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,700
and we can invent

256
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,610
o point on the telegraph or

257
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,640
we create

258
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,300
are the whole

259
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,050
where w is going to be at byproduct of the slice something that

260
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,250
value we don't care about very much because whole thing can be robust to it

261
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,040
that gets what the site might be

262
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,640
make a little bit like this

263
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,120
and there's a green thing

264
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,170
its i is determined by the i want

265
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,590
and it's all there

266
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:37,080
is chosen randomly uniformly from or what role

267
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,850
the two little

268
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,620
and that we all

269
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,300
you aligned why

270
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,970
this way or that way uniformly with the

271
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,040
thank you

272
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,590
so if it

273
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,790
the uniform price of this little horizontal

274
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,660
going up out of all

275
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:56,790
all right

276
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,710
the three is

277
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,080
check to see

278
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,820
the places

279
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,700
what value he said there

280
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,140
and what value if you are

281
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,670
the value star is about

282
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,130
the green line it is all works

283
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,500
that's not far

284
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,590
let's make an additional there

285
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,250
by w

286
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,200
and then check

287
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,540
he was checking out until when you check

288
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,320
i call our

289
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,020
although there

290
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,070
major advantage by

291
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,030
when the world

292
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,140
in this stage

293
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,780
that is wrong

294
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,780
they you have more than

295
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:58,920
they are

296
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,990
there is also a

297
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,260
the of

298
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,490
two of the dual problem is

299
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,920
weight that the there

300
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,720
even without help

301
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,340
which is more in the area

302
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,970
of the network

303
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:34,010
none of them match prior to the

304
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,330
two of a

305
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,240
so one

306
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,450
the other

307
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,930
we don't

308
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,840
and also

309
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,480
i do with my money

310
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,300
you are important for to

311
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,390
it was shown that some of the world there

312
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,420
we know about that so

313
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,850
maybe it will have to work

314
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,970
some of us

315
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,950
the can

316
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,290
the problem

317
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,930
it's here that the that

318
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,030
he should buy it now

319
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:35,420
i would have thought it was

320
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,440
showing that there

321
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,860
so the

322
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:50,530
there are going to want to realize what is what is to

323
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,230
well i e

324
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:03,350
it should be able to use that

325
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,290
so you

326
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,810
there are usually

327
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,940
the ship

328
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:27,330
i would love preservation that allowed

329
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,500
then you to two

330
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,770
it is using

331
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:59,280
so what

332
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,370
he was funded

333
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,470
so what we

334
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,030
i suspect

335
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,430
so far

336
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,840
so i

337
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,760
o for

338
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,030
he is more

339
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,000
you do

340
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,290
one way run the media is a strong

341
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,680
you can find it at all

342
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:50,820
because it is also possible to define the one

343
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,620
and as you can see

344
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,430
you know way you are in for you

345
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:08,860
all them the

346
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,870
it is used by more senior management

347
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,210
we should

348
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:27,570
if there is a little bit more and more actually

349
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,970
which leads

350
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,800
sound is

351
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,950
and there is a

352
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,630
is a

353
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,850
the station by

354
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,290
my sort of thing that would be

355
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,420
the the importance of the

356
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,050
our heroes so

357
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,440
i've been in

358
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:09,940
it's also all of these

359
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:13,260
is the wife or b

360
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,920
with i

361
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:24,170
five or only

362
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:29,720
the war not that are

363
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,750
i don't know

364
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,750
we need to be aware

365
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,670
we have

366
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,840
so agent

367
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,300
and then we

368
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,730
and they

369
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,790
the real

370
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,380
do that

371
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,440
on the day

372
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,310
little bit computer support them then you can finally come up with this with this

373
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:44,960
and it's it's from this because your computer scientist it's clear that you can encode

374
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,150
destroying here

375
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:52,470
with just a few bits of information with a racial program

376
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:57,580
there are of course many many other regular patterns

377
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:03,110
you don't have to use these for example most of my slides also because they

378
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:09,690
are constructed by recursive applications of the harmonic proportion the golden ratio

379
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,310
which some

380
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,720
his claims is preferred over other ratios

381
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,760
you know before i came here i thought this is going to be just another

382
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,370
ECML PKDD conference and there won't be much of an audience but you are actually

383
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,880
aligned audience by my standards

384
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,620
the other day i gave a talk and that was just a single person in

385
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,360
the audience

386
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,250
a young lady i said young lady it's very embarrassing

387
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:43,560
but apparently today i'm i'm going to give this talk just feel

388
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,540
and she said

389
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,510
OK but please hurry

390
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,760
i got to clean up here

391
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:56,560
so what is that about jokes how does all of this have to do what

392
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,120
does this have to do with jokes and humour and and the answer again it's

393
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,470
very simple every child has the punchline the punchline is designed to be unexpected to

394
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:10,260
those who don't already know the if you're all the jokes is totally boring but

395
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,980
if you don't know the jobs and there some

396
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,140
you need extra bits to predict the thing so you predict something but it's not

397
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,630
what you predicted so you need extra bits to store the stuff that you can

398
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:26,910
couldn't predict well however all the jokes that he signed to

399
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:31,900
two have regularity that relates the punchline back to the previous story in the way

400
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,500
human learning algorithms

401
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,110
easily pick out

402
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,310
and so immediately the learning algorithm kicks in

403
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:43,650
and recognise that the punchline is related to the rest of the story in a

404
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,160
way that allows you to

405
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,140
save bits because all you need to insert there's a point to previous part of

406
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,900
the story so i showed you can again get rid of these extra bits added

407
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,030
that said you didn't expect and not safe bits

408
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:04,620
that's the fun that the number of bits that you're saying the first derivative of

409
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,220
the compressibility

410
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,450
that is your interns

411
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,920
that's what you're trying to maximize the actual CD the action selected

412
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,360
the actors selected

413
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:23,800
just as the usual thing that all reinforcement learning algorithms still namely trying to

414
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,450
generate more data which also has property that its

415
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:34,620
and so for example one possible action could be just stay seated and and wait

416
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,150
whether this comedian has another interesting thing to say

417
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,740
so learning from previous experience to predict which other things in the future it might

418
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,730
adding something to repertoire of novel patterns

419
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:55,080
which then so none of novel anymore

420
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,710
here we are in spain and the recently

421
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,770
i had the great honour and pleasure to

422
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,750
to give the scientific talk very much like this one to the king of spain

423
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:18,690
at least he said that he was the king of spain

424
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,160
in fact what he said was if if you are scientist and i'm the king

425
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:28,880
of spain

426
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,270
if you want to build an artificial scientists and artists

427
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:41,080
we have two questions what kind of compression algorithm prediction algorithm to use and what

428
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:46,830
kind of learning algorithm for this method and the other one is what kind of

429
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,260
reinforcement learning algorithm to be used to maximize the intrinsic reward signals that we are

430
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,810
getting as the other guys improving so

431
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,150
the reward

432
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:01,030
maximize has to be smart enough to deal with the situation where the intrinsic rewards

433
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,680
coming from the system

434
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:08,180
and influenced by the limitations of the learning algorithm of the other system vanish over

435
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,650
they vanished because obviously as the compressor predictors learning about what's going on in the

436
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,640
the high order markov chains was true

437
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:21,740
because if you had a second order markov chains

438
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,380
is of the next

439
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:28,150
depend on the past from the last two states take the was

440
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,330
of states

441
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:34,390
state space which is pairs of states markov chain so i always thought it's just

442
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,830
markov chain theory

443
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,100
that's true

444
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:48,740
chemists were very consistent but want to keep things reversible the subject of

445
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:53,350
higher order markov chains doesn't exist as far as i know so now it does

446
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,000
but that's something to say

447
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:01,890
say it at great length but it exists to define things so

448
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,230
markov chains

449
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:10,820
the chance of the next given past depends on the last or states

450
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,640
stochastic process in school

451
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:22,170
the tragic to be reversible with different the reverse i said before if

452
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,890
the graph is the same as the of backward to the

453
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:32,280
the x that's one of x should be the same messages in stationarity should be

454
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,060
the same as the change

455
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,740
those xmxn minus one of x not for being so

456
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,750
that is reversible and

457
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,420
physics sense of

458
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,980
time runs backwards is the same this time and forwards and so there is the

459
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,080
space the space of

460
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:57,870
second order for example markov chains you could ask how priors on that

461
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:03,210
could be factors to test if your processes markov was the second order markov and

462
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,660
so forth in the same group ten

463
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,800
but instead of having to work out of the

464
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,880
works going to

465
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,800
one thing you need to know about the brain graph and that's familiar object in

466
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:25,090
both combinatorics and other parts of the world now because of the small pins people

467
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:31,150
use familiar that in the graph is a graph

468
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,810
in which the vertices or this one companies

469
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:39,360
connect to this one examples

470
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,360
couple which starts

471
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,390
the first time minus one topic

472
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:51,530
the second one minus one table i should have a picture but i i don't

473
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:56,110
if you so that's from the complete graph but if you have restrictions on the

474
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:01,240
edges you can see see that what we found is that

475
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,430
so if you

476
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,970
this is

477
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,740
are indexed by

478
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,970
sapir was

479
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:14,570
this is from BBC to scene simply because that would be ceasing begins with a

480
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,950
scene with c c

481
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:22,010
OK if you do a random walk with reinforcement of the brain

482
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:33,570
of course during the kansas state each time and it is so without without

483
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,090
going to work

484
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:43,860
the that but don't partially exchangeable mixture of conjugate priors in the theory goes through

485
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,360
so high

486
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:52,470
reversible markov chains in pretty good shape for this i never

487
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:59,110
in fact the technical papers they think about the message

488
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,090
second order markov chains which or

489
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:09,660
so this the kind of markov chains with many of you can go in the

490
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,930
direction we want to keep going in that direction

491
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,680
that's useful important just as position

492
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,180
and the

493
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,800
ingredients and mechanics

494
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,910
i mentioned the markov chain theory and it's quite useful radford neal in his own

495
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,150
way has been

496
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,450
put it in china has been stumbling around in the same

497
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:34,760
and is something that is very interesting

498
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,360
corner space it's it's quite different from from

499
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:44,070
reversibility is you'll see if you just think about second order reversibility because if you

500
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:50,720
go to pillars is not the case that reverse trajectory reversible second order markov chain

501
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,630
has its per process

502
00:34:52,650 --> 00:35:00,430
reversible it's different different subjects and OK can have the next transparency

503
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:06,130
one of the the things to do is to

504
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:11,720
both math scientific problems out of the river

505
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,800
the problem of

506
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,610
of understanding the priors so if it is going to be pretty big spaces like

507
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,760
prior on the right

508
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,530
well i don't know if people don't seem to ask that question so often but

509
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:31,320
i'm asking and so is the start at the kinds of things that you could

510
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:35,550
about what properties of these priors

511
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,910
so suppose i

512
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:46,030
in the simplest case just to start with namely me

513
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:50,110
by the transition matrix and each of the rows

514
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:58,860
independent and if so uniform vector on the simplex uniform vector the simplex independently that's

515
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,180
probability distribution on transition matrices

516
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:09,860
what's the distribution of the stationary distribution we're not enforcing that

517
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:18,490
it's a problem not the distribution of the three three french to french and italian

518
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,950
showed up and it's sort of large

519
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:30,010
you know the it's sort sort of one of the brain which that the stationary

520
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:35,740
it converges to a point mass one over and over and when n is large

521
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,340
one of the

522
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,630
that seems like it's all the same setting

523
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,250
i wouldn't mind

524
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,860
going on

525
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,760
how we have to

526
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,120
i would like to go on place so the proof is there if you want

527
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,120
to see

528
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,370
again is approved there

529
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,070
wind w

530
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,580
so the lemma is

531
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:10,840
if box find is in w exactly when for all v and w

532
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:17,870
WRC flies five it's a it's is the box flies in w

533
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,350
exactly when the area there you go

534
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,790
using your reachability relation

535
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,350
five w

536
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,870
it's just by the definition

537
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,530
the other direction is something that you have to prove all of this

538
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:38,080
stuff about local deducibility

539
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,880
and this is this is where it's absolutely essential to use local deduced in it

540
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,390
doesn't go through

541
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,890
this thing here

542
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,570
is an infinite formula k

543
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:02,450
so what you need is you need the local deduction says no no it's not

544
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,630
that i'm interested in

545
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,980
there some finite subpart part of which gives me the deduction that i want that's

546
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,660
absolutely essential for the process to go through

547
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,800
so what's the truth lemma states kids now where

548
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:22,500
getting to the end of the day is that

549
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:29,240
this lemma says that we can lift the membership from at formula

550
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,600
a particular phi

551
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,110
is w

552
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:39,970
particular finding that w then u k

553
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,990
phys true that w

554
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:48,940
we've lifted development

555
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,920
and this one it induction on the length of the four

556
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,420
so the base cases

557
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,150
why does it the way we define the evaluation

558
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,030
i assume it's true for all formulae of length

559
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,190
i assume that you have the formula of length n

560
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,550
in this case it's the

561
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,390
pushed induction through

562
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,530
maybe maybe i'll do this one so we have

563
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,500
so we want to claim

564
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,550
is equal to true

565
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,500
OK what is it it's

566
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,150
he is

567
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:46,260
c and w that definition of the information

568
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,480
in your class of world

569
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,690
when have

570
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:58,420
it is in one step as successor of w and

571
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,230
the valuation thanks

572
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,330
so the the

573
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,430
i called the truth

574
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,810
that's the definition of when

575
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,890
box formula is true it

576
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,390
i've just written definitions

577
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,370
now you say well

578
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,840
there is some

579
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,340
the which is related to w

580
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,070
we have to show

581
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,530
the c

582
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,280
maxiter what does that mean lies inside the

583
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,320
so what have we got we got exactly that picture

584
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,420
we've got the here

585
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,800
bauxite is true in other words it's a if and only if

586
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,260
five xtri here five smaller formula hypothesis applies

587
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,480
everything goes back to that definition of the reachability relation

588
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,860
how does the actual completeness

589
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:13,120
so we started with

590
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,120
wanting to show

591
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,380
from this to this

592
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,140
we had no handle

593
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,130
the opposite if we assume that there is no

594
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,440
these deviations from the status

595
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:32,520
this status consistent if the gene the generative bayesian deviation is has the same sign

596
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,650
the status of b so this means that if a is evaluating someone with the

597
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:41,960
heart with the positive status meaning higher status than himself should be positively surprised you

598
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,020
should be more like to generate minus any if a evaluate someone with the negatives

599
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,330
that the source that is smaller than you should be more negative than what he

600
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,350
usually so he's baseline is sort of deviation based negative and then for the conceptual

601
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,880
basis for the set apart from the viewpoint of this is that the opposite right

602
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:07,880
so so the action is status consistent when when somebody of high-status evaluates mission gives

603
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,130
me minus right so so this the sign of evaluation has to be different than

604
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:17,100
the that the status of course evaluating me and similarly if somebody of negative status

605
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,190
evaluates me

606
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:24,520
then perhaps most should be plus OK so this is how now established this predictions

607
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:29,850
and as i said before sort of for the deviation to be consistent with balance

608
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,370
it is just whether it completes a balanced rider so here are a few examples

609
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:39,310
so this is now exact results for epinions dataset so what i have here is

610
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,210
sixteen prior

611
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,920
this is the count of how often does each of these triads appear some appear

612
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,350
like three hundred thousand times the

613
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:53,270
less frequent plants appear only of two thousand one times here is the probability of

614
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:58,060
that prior being closed by plus right so one was friend of a friend

615
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:03,310
and this one is closest plus ninety seven percent of the times

616
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:08,020
and then what you have here is also the deviation in the in the baseline

617
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,900
so what is the way you should understand somebody that up person who is who

618
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:19,480
appears itself in a friend of a friend relationship there ninety five standard deviations more

619
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,500
likely to give up less than what we usually and the person that is assuming

620
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,700
that is two hundred standard deviations more likely to receive applause than what they usually

621
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,150
get right so what i mean by this this is

622
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:36,670
like everything bigger than here is is significant so this is like super significant right

623
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:40,770
on this one for example would be negative edges and again when you have enemy

624
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:41,750
of the enemy

625
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:47,310
you you you tend to close that stupid things like the the random worked closely

626
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:52,330
with eighty percent probability right to close you close to plus fifty percent which is

627
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:57,980
sort of a seven hundred standard deviations more negative than what usually

628
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,380
and then what they show here

629
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,890
it is whether the behavior is consistent with balance and the behavior is consistent with

630
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:09,870
standards and for example here is that here is one of the cases where i

631
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:14,630
stand this makes correct predictions but balance makes wrong prediction so this is a prime

632
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:20,440
number nine that's the example that i have x positively evaluating a and b

633
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,310
for example balance in one case would say that

634
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:30,170
then the edge should be should be negative while the status correctly makes a prediction

635
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:35,420
that a will be positive the deviation of a positive but deviation of the will

636
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:40,920
negative right and then there is another example for example the eleven where now i

637
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,580
have positive edges pointing downwards so again balance would say

638
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,650
put the glass here what we see is that actually people tend to give one

639
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:52,830
minus so even though there it's a friend of a friend but in the wrong

640
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:58,460
direction people given negative evaluation which is again consistent that this so overall what we

641
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,980
see is the balance

642
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,100
correctly predicts about seven eight of these triangles and status correctly predicts fourteen or fifteen

643
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,880
out of sixteen trying so it provides a much better explanation too happy people create

644
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,540
these pages

645
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,560
another thing that that another sort of more more global level of analysis you can

646
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,900
start asking what is the probability of an edge how does it depend on how

647
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,880
embedded is how many common friends and and what you see from here is that

648
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,000
the more he invented the edge the more likely it is positive and this is

649
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,500
like the the baseline there would be no effect so basically what is so that

650
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:36,190
means that networks are globally threatened supply stand to according to in places where the

651
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:41,060
network is there's connection there are many common friends and then minuses are where there

652
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:45,400
are few human friends in common which means like we like strategies is no friends

653
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,060
in common very likely to be minus many friends in common much more likely to

654
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:53,130
be different so this is another type of information can have about these networks

655
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:57,330
the reason why i was sort of showing this because this is what i would

656
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:00,490
like to do i would like to go and be able to predict whether a

657
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:04,870
pair of people with friends or enemies right so my my my my second is

658
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:09,730
the following i'm having this sign signed network pluses and minuses on you know on

659
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,290
the edges and now

660
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:16,880
given the network and when all the signs but sign one edge predict what is

661
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,560
the sign on the so what want to give you want to predict what is

662
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,330
the sign up on that that's so basically whether you're going to be friends or

663
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:30,710
this is a very simple like having formulated simply as possible so i want to

664
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:34,850
predict the sign of jury i have a binary classification problem

665
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:38,480
so the positive class is that this is the friendship negative class means this is

666
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,350
not the friendship my my prediction methods be very simple logistic regression i will do

667
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:49,150
this on a data set where we stop writing subsample positive edges so that the

668
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,900
random guessing would be fifty percent accuracy

669
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:58,610
my my evaluation metric here in this talk will be classification accuracy another question is

670
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:05,130
what are the features that place-kicking duties logistic regression and here are different types of

671
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,900
features so the first set of features is simply lost

672
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,130
is to generate the vector of sixteen numbers that just count if is that i'm

673
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:18,790
interested in predicting in what kind of does this edge appeared right so for every

674
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:22,440
possible try and i have a feeling i come across and i just count in

675
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,270
common triads like this is this

676
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:28,940
embedding comment i think that it is that you can give me account of sixteen

677
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,250
that's the for the sort of the first set

678
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,310
just says how is this edge locally embedded in the network and then the second

679
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:40,850
part is a sort of more summary statistics like what is the size of the

680
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:44,750
sign in and out degree of node u and really what is the total degree

681
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:48,730
what's the total number of triads or embeddedness of this what is the number of

682
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,330
common friends between you and me

683
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:54,420
here are sort of the results of the the thing is

684
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:02,190
use that idea and our narrates like this between twenty two six two to six

685
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:06,560
percent so this means that one we on epinions we can predict whether people trust

686
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:10,520
one another with the ninety three ninety four percent accuracy we can do the same

687
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:17,040
on slashdot and wikipedia the prediction of the prediction results around eighty percent so so

688
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,100
if random guessing due fifty percent accuracy

689
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:27,310
this very simple feature vector of sixteen c sixteen items gives you ninety three percent

690
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:32,940
accuracy on two datasets eighty percent accuracy on the other data and sort of this

691
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:38,940
this this corresponds to a compares favourably sort of previous work that was published about

692
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,650
two thousand four by all

693
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:45,350
the red where they were really doing some kind of trust propagation through the network

694
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,060
and the error rates there

695
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:54,000
much higher what also comes from here is is that slashdot and opinions seem to

696
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,420
be very easy to to model and predict while wikipedia seems to be much harder

697
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,380
to predict

698
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:05,130
another interesting question you can ask is that because we have this very different datasets

699
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:09,940
how how so you know the people use do people create positive and negative edges

700
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,500
differently in these different datasets so what i will do is a very simple experiment

701
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:17,870
i will ask how generalizable i'm not my results or my models across the data

702
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:21,580
sets so what i do is i will bring my model i'm showing knowledgable where

703
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,540
i will bring my model in the real world datasets and i make the prediction

704
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:29,190
on the column dataset OK so here is here is what i mean by so

705
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:33,610
for example the edit here means that i bring my model and opinions but i

706
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,600
evaluate it on slashdot today

707
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,200
you i have some entity

708
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:42,040
to a page that describes the entity then feel free is the appropriate coatings

709
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,340
so this is this

710
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:47,920
so called hash sorry is the so-called slash approach because the u i has basically

711
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,270
at the last step special character

712
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:56,250
then there's the other approaches to hash approach

713
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,930
we would end up with something

714
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,900
so basically we take the generic document URI brand telescope about

715
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,010
and then we append hash

716
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,960
something that's a hash it's for example

717
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,560
this gives us a different URI

718
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:15,690
so the page one URI the generic document has one URI

719
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,830
and the brand of whisky has different URI

720
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,690
but if we look up to see why

721
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:24,150
initially p lookups

722
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,800
offer you are with the ash something at the the end they have something to

723
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,070
be ignored and the HDP interaction so this means

724
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,000
if we make an actually if you look upon this URI then that's part will

725
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,170
just be ignored and we end up again with the generic document

726
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:48,260
so no no it's just whatever whatever you want

727
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,070
it's personal preference properties whatever

728
00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:02,590
the about what's the generic

729
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,840
document where get the HTML document or the RDF human

730
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:28,520
well you

731
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,690
that's right

732
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:39,680
so in this case he was the has URI we don't work

733
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,990
so you're talking just about the history like it or

734
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,030
right i see you

735
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,530
you mean like OK so in this case here

736
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:54,860
we could actually

737
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:01,550
it would be OK to just kind of you know this part doesn't really have

738
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:05,300
the same if we say we do this we do this has URI approach

739
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,040
you know this is one of the then we could just say you know this

740
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,950
about party it doesn't really matter

741
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:14,720
because like telescope we have used this URI for anything yet so we could just

742
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,130
say this is a generative we could just append the

743
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:21,610
the the the hash it

744
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:25,240
it's the different i again the requirements are fulfilled

745
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:31,300
sure should i mean that the words in the u i don't matter at all

746
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,580
the important thing is

747
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:36,380
it needs to be like

748
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:39,720
o and don't use the same but i four two different things

749
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,740
like for the page and the entity

750
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,160
and then the new

751
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,190
so we need one for age and the different one for the entity for the

752
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:56,700
for for the brand

753
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:23,750
no no because

754
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,060
no you

755
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:26,770
if you do the first three

756
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,660
but the way

757
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,840
the way i describe it like the way you

758
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,600
the first redirect from

759
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:36,020
alaska talisker slash about the history of

760
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:36,890
but then

761
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:41,240
you don't need to do any further redirect but you can surf whatever variant you

762
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,400
want from that URI the generic document URI i

763
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,590
so you don't need a redirect from

764
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:50,400
from about to about HTML to about the end of each image you don't need

765
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:51,520
to do redirects there

766
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,440
just directly to

767
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,870
the english version of the at

768
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,260
right at the generic document your

769
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:08,140
note is basically

770
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:15,240
could probably do with that you could do it with with with

771
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,290
you are we writing but that's again

772
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:21,660
depend on whatsoever using and it's kind of an implementation detail at the same time

773
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,400
you could

774
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:28,350
you know if this is like a php script that processing the request

775
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:31,090
the description could just look at the except error

776
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,640
you could just call the

777
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:38,080
appropriate function in the framework that produces the HTML or the order of

778
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,060
so what

779
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,660
but the

780
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,780
key point

781
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:46,330
for implementing continuity if you don't need to do any redirects you can

782
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:49,690
you can be turned to serve you can set up to serve in the way

783
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,570
that we experience the appropriate content

784
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,080
just depending on the except without the redirect

785
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:59,780
to put this on the location header into the response

786
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:03,280
so the client knows oh by the way if i want to that particular area

787
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,940
five and twelve month one together and the likelihood function has a nice speak

788
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:11,380
we can

789
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,640
i think a bit more about what this function actually is how does the function depend on the data

790
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,860
well this particular function depends on the data in this way

791
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,220
it's got z

792
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:22,850
lambda and be

793
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,510
and it's got e to the minus let's take this right

794
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,250
so socket upstairs even minus some

795
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:35,580
on lambda

796
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,580
is all you need to know in fact

797
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,990
i am rewriting the likelihood

798
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,110
so the brilliant intuition that said why don't you just compute the mean of the data

799
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,350
it is exactly right if all you're trying to do is inferred lambda assuming there's

800
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,600
one exponential then the only thing you need to know

801
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,010
it is the sum accent

802
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:03,860
andrew then you can work out the likelihood function so you don't actually need to

803
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,320
know all the data points the twentieth places you just need for some of

804
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,890
the cost of this particular form

805
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,080
of the probability density

806
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,300
if model that look like this it would be in the mean that is the thing you need to know

807
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:22,320
but the general lessons drawn from this is not ok so now i need to

808
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,760
compute the mean my data i can solve any problem

809
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:26,620
what you need to do

810
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:30,140
his work at the likelihood function and the likelihood function will tell you what you

811
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,060
want to do with your data and in this case the answer is to find

812
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:33,370
the mean

813
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:34,240
and then

814
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:38,780
what the likelihood function and on the screen we have a likelihood function there

815
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,180
i can

816
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,680
re-create these because we're just looking at

817
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,140
here are

818
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,280
just repeat the sequence it

819
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,640
there are three probability densities over data space

820
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:59,410
o x three different values of lambda

821
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:03,910
you can imagine getting data at point such as three or five or twelve

822
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,010
the predictions are these different models for different values of lambda are simple exponential that

823
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,390
something you can notice about them

824
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,720
is there are places for example the left hand blue line

825
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,640
where the red is about the orange is above the yellow

826
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,870
so the red wings it predicted better

827
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:22,950
there are places where the yellow is about the orange above the red

828
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,780
and there are places where

829
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,180
the orange is thought

830
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:27,950
so there are

831
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,680
such that any of those three can be the winner in terms of having predicted better

832
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:34,760
and the other two

833
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:36,490
and that's another way of saying

834
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:42,570
when we put the likelihood function there may well be at peak as a function of lambda

835
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,930
so now we do that's we plot the likelihood function

836
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:50,140
hand this is the likelihood multiplying together those three

837
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,470
and i've shown in red orange and yellow here

838
00:57:56,870 --> 00:58:01,470
the three values lambda that we were considering above we look lambda as two five and ten

839
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,410
this is when you get data

840
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,010
at least three

841
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:09,080
the three points

842
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,510
i mentioned before

843
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:13,390
you could

844
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,140
stable time scale

845
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:23,930
rule can

846
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:32,510
so just going through these sequence again

847
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,910
his three places you could get data

848
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,430
left endpoint points to

849
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:39,720
the red hypothesis being the most probable

850
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:42,760
data point five

851
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:46,260
prefers the hypothesis that lambda is something like five

852
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:50,640
and data points at the right hand side preferred hypothesis that lambda might be ten also

853
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:53,010
to the hypothesis that lambda is to a five

854
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:57,070
so this is what the likelihoods look like if you get just one data point

855
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:59,140
that is respectively at three or five twelve

856
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:02,510
andy this is the product of

857
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:06,720
so that's based thereon

858
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,470
finding a single parameter lambda

859
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,570
and it wasn't easy because all you have to do

860
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:13,640
was right

861
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,260
three lines

862
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:23,640
the new plot to define the function and now we've got this one tells us

863
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:24,820
the answer

864
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:30,990
thank you very much be before we start

865
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:35,250
and we start to look at the material and we've we've got some great stuff

866
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:40,450
i'd like to ask you to help me out with what is one of the

867
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:43,480
most important parts of today's presentation

868
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,250
i'm going to ask you to do do something for me to worry it's not

869
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:50,590
very difficult and and then

870
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:55,500
the rest of the time i didn't work so if you would please stand up

871
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,850
put your hand on your heart

872
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:06,770
so on this side is turned to face the back of the room

873
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:13,590
now very carefully because of the the furniture take one step forward

874
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:19,290
and so as to thank you very much please sit down again please sit down

875
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:21,510
that's wonderful thank you

876
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,880
i said that was the most important part of the presentation not for you

877
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:31,760
that's the most important part of the presentation for me i work for this gentleman

878
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,380
here a gentleman called but he

879
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,290
he is the founder of our company

880
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,850
and he has what he likes to call

881
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:40,380
a hands on

882
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,760
approach to the business

883
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:46,490
we like to say he tends to interfere in everything and

884
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:49,120
sometime in the next week or ten days

885
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,710
but will calls that standard

886
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:58,120
and you say tell me first and what did derek do for your audience in

887
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,350
now i like this job

888
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:04,460
i get paid for doing this job

889
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:07,790
and i get paid very well just for doing what i like which is talking

890
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:11,740
that's what irish people like to do so i want to protect that so

891
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:14,710
now she can say in all honesty all o

892
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,320
he got them on their feet

893
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:19,130
he touched our hearts

894
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:24,130
he turned them around and he got the moving forward so for three months job

895
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:28,240
security and now in your that now i o u and i need to give

896
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:33,500
you some good information this morning the rest of the work is mine

897
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,160
from this point forward

898
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:38,480
in slovenia

899
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,830
as elsewhere

900
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:45,010
and coming from ireland i can appreciate exactly the challenge that every leader in every

901
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:49,070
economy has today very simple

902
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,580
if in this room you have leader

903
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,790
or manager

904
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:55,860
or group lead or anything like that in your title

905
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,190
this is the only thing that matters

906
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,250
in the last two years particularly i guess

907
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:06,260
we've all been under pressure to make sure that the bottom line stays

908
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:13,410
so when when things got started to get even tighter we cut down the costs

909
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:16,230
is as much as we can that's that's what you do

910
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,750
and that in fact

911
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:20,660
in bad times teachers anything

912
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,480
they teachers that in good times we get lazy

913
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:28,200
and sometimes we have costs there we didn't really need

914
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,290
but i would say it's safe to say

915
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:32,440
at this stage

916
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:39,570
we have trimmed down costs pretty much in every organization everywhere as low as they

917
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:40,790
can go

918
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:42,950
we engineered processes

919
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:47,450
we looked at any way that we could do business

920
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:55,100
that would make things more effective more efficient more productive what we did that too

921
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:58,230
and now we're at the stage in twenty eleven

922
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,730
where the but he needs of your world

923
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:05,980
what the shareholders the company owners of whom every reporter says hey you did a

924
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,630
great job

925
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:11,250
but i need another twenty percent this year i know of no twenty five percent

926
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,920
this year january one is always

927
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,570
the time when you both celebrate

928
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:23,060
and commiserate because in my company does a great job derek around thirty five percent

929
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:27,600
we need forty five percent this year and that's the same in organisations

930
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:31,280
over the next while

931
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:33,410
the only way

932
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:36,140
we can actually achieve

933
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,380
that additional productivity

934
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:43,200
running the very lean operations that we have now

935
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:45,050
is if we can make each

936
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:47,380
and every one of our people more productive

937
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,370
if we can get more from each and every one of our people

938
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:56,560
now the extent to which we can do that is really the extent to which

939
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,320
they want to give us

940
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:03,510
that extra productivity is the extent to which they are engaged

941
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:09,720
a dazed is a i really want to do this job to the best of

942
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,700
my ability

943
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:15,670
i am so interested in this organization and what i do and what we're trying

944
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:20,020
to achieve that i'm even going to give you some of my time to get

945
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,140
this thing

946
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:22,900
and in

947
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,680
just about every country worldwide

948
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,720
we have about twenty percent of people

949
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:29,430
four engaged

950
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,520
twenty percent of people who are positively disengaged that is

951
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:36,130
if i can break this company i will

952
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:39,690
and then the floating sixty percent middle who are

953
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:44,750
one of the day i'm engaging on a bad day and disengaging is i give

954
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,020
you an average

955
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:49,830
why is important

956
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,970
because basically there's an enormous difference

957
01:04:55,020 --> 01:05:01,470
between the results that engaged are organisations with high engagement get

958
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:04,070
it did this one study

959
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,940
by the towers parents you can see one of the larger ones

960
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:11,700
about eighty thousand watts at eighty thousand ninety thousand people

961
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:13,820
eighteen countries worldwide

962
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,380
and i found very simply

963
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:18,030
hi engagement companies

964
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:23,470
dramatically outperforms low engagement companies that makes sense

965
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:30,110
if the people that are working for you are genuinely dedicated

966
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:34,130
getting the results you want to get of course you're going to get fifty one

967
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:39,680
percent greater operating income than the average and of course you're going to get greater

968
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,500
earnings per share

969
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,240
in twenty eleven

970
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,430
twenty twelve

971
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,780
twenty thirteen

972
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,780
engagement is going to be

973
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,080
really one of those

974
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:57,840
those issues that is going to become the primary concern of anybody

975
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,330
was the manager later

976
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:01,950
currently of course

977
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:06,030
were tied up in in dreadful economic challenges

978
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:09,860
but hidden behind those economic challenges

979
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:12,510
is an issue that hasn't gone away

980
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:15,590
and that is the demographic issues the fact that

981
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:18,070
in ten years time

982
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,070
i will be more sought after

983
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,190
and customers are

984
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:27,080
so engaging the people we have one

985
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:30,010
so they get the results we need today

986
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:31,130
and two

987
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:35,760
so that when things start to look better they stay around

988
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:38,130
that's what it's all about

989
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:40,380
and they are

990
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,180
thank you

991
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:05,000
talk about

992
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,880
it is

993
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,590
thank you would

994
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,810
basically it

995
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,260
the main

996
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:27,740
we can try to

997
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,320
two but

998
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,210
this all

999
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:51,620
you will be in the image

1000
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,630
and it is

1001
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:57,330
it is

1002
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:01,640
because the

1003
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:03,140
he was

1004
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:10,170
we know other

1005
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,570
how can

1006
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:17,500
the college

1007
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:21,880
the one

1008
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:23,290
this collection

1009
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:24,510
find that

1010
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:29,310
and people who you are or what the need of

1011
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:34,210
what they assume that

1012
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,560
which is

1013
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,790
actually are relevant to each

1014
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:46,930
hello my

1015
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:48,750
so we have a u

1016
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:55,450
because of it's oil was the first of all i always trust

1017
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:57,930
for people

1018
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:03,070
and so on but again and again because of the way

1019
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,440
that's just a little bit more than just the words

1020
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:08,770
that is true

1021
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,730
combined with

1022
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:13,940
so i

1023
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:16,870
and by the

1024
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,890
read to us

1025
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:34,270
another way to use image grouping and the most popular way in medical college

1026
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:42,500
is the same idea still images have really just so we have support

1027
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:44,140
which is which belongs to one

1028
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:50,940
but you that these groups are called by way

1029
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:52,840
so medical images

1030
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:56,870
these sometimes doctors

1031
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:03,010
b is not actually a lot

1032
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:08,850
images are just like think that this is the same

1033
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:13,690
it is some kind of mind

1034
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:14,570
it's a good way

1035
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:19,430
compare the collection using these girls but it is very time-consuming

1036
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,640
two such groups

1037
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,540
another the way

1038
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:25,940
quite likely to

1039
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:28,920
researchers tried to make

1040
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:34,030
this is

1041
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:39,730
exactly like but

1042
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:46,490
so to their similarity to the might

1043
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:51,650
because they are

1044
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:09,920
well no

1045
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,590
actually the US

1046
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:29,240
so idea is that

1047
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:32,980
one way that

1048
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:35,370
so called legal

1049
01:11:53,440 --> 01:12:03,780
we all want and what they are in the end we

1050
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:06,540
built up

1051
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,540
and also that

1052
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:14,980
it is that we can define a

1053
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:18,430
the one was the

1054
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:23,860
the problem with a

1055
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:32,680
that's right

1056
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:40,320
if this is the most relevant to the

1057
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:43,310
right now

1058
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:47,270
we can

1059
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,940
on the right

1060
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:55,620
usually one

1061
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:05,950
subject object

1062
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:12,950
the fact that the government

1063
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:16,870
most of

1064
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:22,080
does all this mean

1065
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:29,770
the first

1066
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:32,690
the beach is the class

1067
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,340
here is

1068
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:37,890
this image is query and this is the same

1069
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:40,900
and the results of the system

1070
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:44,610
can you tell me which one is better

1071
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:48,540
which one is right

1072
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:52,090
one of the main

1073
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,050
assumes the

1074
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:56,570
this is

1075
01:13:56,580 --> 01:14:02,190
actually i can and i don't think that i would like to use this image

1076
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:12,800
close one aquarium here on the second place so on this that one is better

1077
01:14:13,770 --> 01:14:19,890
does we can do this and i were forced to

1078
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:25,190
one is that the also to see system some action

1079
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:29,760
you can select query registered works quite well

1080
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,520
and you can put on your user page

1081
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:35,290
the square and say

1082
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:37,490
it's just not my

1083
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,560
the best

1084
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:43,370
because the image is the the most

1085
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:44,730
and they

1086
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:49,340
there's an article in another query which doesn't work

1087
01:14:52,910 --> 01:15:00,070
and the you use compilers

1088
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:03,870
again the only

1089
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:05,520
i'm charging to that

1090
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,170
calculation of i and j

1091
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:10,080
that calculation one j

1092
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,060
so you can view it in terms of

1093
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,540
analysis of bookkeeping argument

1094
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,330
just as well the charge

1095
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:19,270
in to

1096
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:24,160
not to calculate my own to do all my own local things close enough to

1097
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,390
the value in the next one

1098
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,410
get returned

1099
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:34,020
OK and then it has go calculate well that's OK that's all been charged

1100
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,810
i j one

1101
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:43,000
for every cell only cost me constant time where mn cells

1102
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:44,890
the water and then

1103
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:50,060
four per entry

1104
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:55,000
and you can start using advertised analysis story

1105
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:56,980
how much space does it take

1106
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:01,810
if you're just start looking at space

1107
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:05,600
it turns out for some of these out really important

1108
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:07,560
based on

1109
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:14,600
storage space

1110
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,670
also in times and

1111
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:20,890
historically CIJ table

1112
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,640
the restoring x and y

1113
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:24,980
that's just

1114
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,870
plus and so that's

1115
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:29,960
negligible but mostly i need the

1116
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:36,790
memoisation five algorithm is is a really good strategy and programming

1117
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:38,020
for many things

1118
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:43,810
when you have the same parameters and you get the same results it doesn't work

1119
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:46,730
in programs where you have the side effect

1120
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:48,390
it's certainly is when you're

1121
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:53,850
when you're the calculation for given set of parameters might be different on each call

1122
01:16:53,930 --> 01:17:00,370
four was something which is essentially like functional programming type of environment

1123
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:03,460
and you can calculate once you can look it up

1124
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:07,230
so this is very helpful

1125
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:10,810
it takes a fair amount of space

1126
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:14,230
it also doesn't proceed in in very orderly way

1127
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:18,120
so another strategy for doing exactly the same calculation

1128
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,620
in a bottom-up way

1129
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:23,140
that's what we call dynamic approach

1130
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:31,210
the idea

1131
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:53,100
just use

1132
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:23,600
this board

1133
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:30,390
so here's what we do is look at the CIJ table

1134
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,120
i realize is actually an orderly way

1135
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:34,750
of filling in the table

1136
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:37,080
top down

1137
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:42,080
OK but there's actually way we can do it

1138
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:46,000
here's the

1139
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:47,500
the idea

1140
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,660
let's make table

1141
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:59,100
so is x

1142
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:15,160
here's why

1143
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:18,040
and initialize

1144
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:25,750
these cases

1145
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,580
four CIJ

1146
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,270
but c is zero meaning are prefixed with no

1147
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,480
elements in it

1148
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:39,810
critics that with anything else link is zero

1149
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:42,410
OK so that's basically how

1150
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:46,170
i found the supporters here

1151
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:51,890
now what i can do is just use my formula which are raised there

1152
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,210
to compute

1153
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:59,160
what is the longest common subsequence link the longest common sense subsequence

1154
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:04,930
from this character

1155
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:08,190
and why in this character next to this character

1156
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:10,620
here for example they don't match

1157
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:14,830
the maximum of these two values

1158
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:18,100
here they do match

1159
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:21,940
it says it's one plus

1160
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:28,390
and the the original nineteen this is not entity extraction the practical problem here is

1161
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:29,920
hard to find

1162
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:34,720
people who are experts in this area who are not maybe specified of being experts

1163
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,800
in this area in the skills database because

1164
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:41,260
they might have just use different

1165
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:45,920
different names you could say i'm an expert in search information retrieval and i might

1166
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:51,420
not find you or they have just not updated their skills so

1167
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:55,380
and the way how this process goes is that what we did is very simple

1168
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:59,490
approach and so if searching expert in large interactive displays

1169
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:06,020
all the aquarium my enterprise search solution we are here using an SP solution and

1170
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:10,920
i'll get a bunch of documents now from the documents we can extract entities this

1171
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:16,040
doesn't have to be done on the fly it can be done beforehand and this

1172
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,220
means people

1173
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:21,060
who appear in these documents so what and that is just a list of the

1174
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:25,100
four hundred five hundred entities that are relevant to my topic

1175
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:30,380
OK so now i wanted to brand this because we wanna find the best experts

1176
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:35,430
in this area and to do this very simple so we took each of the

1177
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:39,710
entities and and the to the initial inquiry so new query would be large interactive

1178
01:21:39,710 --> 01:21:45,320
displays plus the first entity kelly and we get about a set of documents for

1179
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:50,970
each combination of original query and entity and now what we do is simple cosine

1180
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:54,080
similarity between the to both sets of documents

1181
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:58,530
so what we wanna find is the closest closest sets of documents

1182
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:04,300
all for a query and and fifty two do or to the set of documents

1183
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,720
corresponds to the original

1184
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:11,140
a topic and what get in this way is the rank of entities this we

1185
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:14,010
get who's the best experts in the area

1186
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:18,800
now this seems like a simple approach we tried to do this with the text

1187
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,640
from the documents but the results were not is this actually using them at the

1188
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:27,080
metadata and the parts i mentioned in the previous slides

1189
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:31,900
so people are very simple so in order evaluate we actually

1190
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:39,420
deployed it in our enterprise search solution and i'll actually show how it looks like

1191
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:47,640
i think that so this is how erm sable like search and browsing of large

1192
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:55,860
because most of the documents in their repository not but i think around one-third is

1193
01:22:55,860 --> 01:23:01,500
powerpoints and there's a lot of graphs inside including in office documents that's where there's

1194
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,360
a lot of graphs there is a need for visually seeing

1195
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:10,010
well what is inside so here the was for as i can sort of browse

1196
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:15,230
through the case something

1197
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:18,380
companies do ask for

1198
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:22,300
so what

1199
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:34,450
OK so i can browse through the content of the document descended from wanna downloaded

1200
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:37,210
instead of actually just

1201
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:43,680
if of actually just downloading and finding out that in this one hundred page document

1202
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:49,680
is not what they need when we first introduced this people were really impressed because

1203
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:54,420
what they had before is just the box and google type of center books with

1204
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:56,360
a list of snippets of

1205
01:23:56,380 --> 01:24:01,080
text snippets and they didn't know what was the document was about and this is

1206
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:06,080
how we actually got our use of these people were really interested so here you

1207
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:12,690
can actually go from documents which on documents OK so here in the filters correspond

1208
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:15,100
to some of them

1209
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:17,620
metadata fields it's we have

1210
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,530
the automatically so sensitive search

1211
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:26,360
but what's my interest is the experts i mentioned so for instance i can search

1212
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:29,100
for help

1213
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:31,620
the data mining code

1214
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:39,100
so i did should get list experts

1215
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:42,580
and here there should be for some reason i mean if it can just be

1216
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:47,490
their profiles pulled pulled from the

1217
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:52,600
official central positive saying could they are way of what is it belong to what

1218
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,320
has been by

1219
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:59,780
the day by the office times they dealing with they works time-consuming finally can filter

1220
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:02,880
based on their levels and

1221
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:09,400
based on locations and different thinks OK so

1222
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,820
i'll talk about

1223
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,140
OK so we

1224
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:14,620
tried the same experiment

1225
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:20,880
but we had this interactive bot which i is now accounts baby here was we

1226
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,780
give the solution to our users that they can search for some topic and a

1227
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:30,230
list of users of the online will appear and then what happens here is there

1228
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:34,300
was a lot of vanity searches so the users were not finding themselves to the

1229
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:38,450
top they believed they were experts they really unhappy so we had to some to

1230
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:43,270
somehow compensate for these vanity searches but making sure that your name appears in the

1231
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:48,860
first ten experts you can't kind of bumped up to be the first one and

1232
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:56,410
then all sort of happiness OK the system sort of works that's bad and this

1233
01:25:56,410 --> 01:26:02,230
present believe about this is that is used as much as the expert search there

1234
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:07,510
because i think people have to go to another IM client and search for something

1235
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:14,990
them more willing to search within the our sable application but interesting

1236
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:19,320
and the the IM bot also had support for time zones people connected to the

1237
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:26,000
people which are online the an interesting thing is once we found out we believe

1238
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:30,720
the two an expert in in this area we send out emails of asking them

1239
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:35,380
to to confirm if their experts in this area as and actually got can quite

1240
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:40,040
nice responses people i would go and they can look and say yes i AM

1241
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:45,880
so the others and was performing of very low it very well in an applied

1242
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:48,020
deployed environment

1243
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,670
OK so

1244
01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:57,840
reusable information about quickly these that we thought we were to uses graphics and why

1245
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:04,100
because as you've seen sable there are lots of new information and power powerpoints made

1246
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:09,770
make more than one third of documents in a repository so we thought we developed

1247
01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:14,910
this enterprise taxonomy which was things like architecture diagrams it's not very easy to that

1248
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:19,270
they had to achieve diagrams but that's might be what i'm actually looking for might

1249
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:24,320
be looking for an picture bagram for active project so if it's a powerpoint is

1250
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:28,750
the one hundred slide document i would have to download and find it so it's

1251
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:34,800
not very easy to find those what we did this is sort of relatively simple

1252
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,950
so in this sense you can say

1253
01:27:36,990 --> 01:27:41,900
your characterising how many support vectors like it in the solution or how many points

1254
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:45,970
do i to i trust how many points do i want to satisfy the margin

1255
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:49,900
condition is how many points but i allowed to be margin errors

1256
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:01,920
six i

1257
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:06,530
because of the course i should have been more explicit about this

1258
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:11,800
so size is the variable of the optimisation problems and i so i will

1259
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:14,450
along fault lines to violate

1260
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:15,700
the street

1261
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,700
inequality constraints

1262
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:23,650
and if they violated then discs i will grow but because i will be penalized

1263
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:28,970
in the objective function so in some therapy optimisation problem just like w and a

1264
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:30,570
and b

1265
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:36,400
so initially we just we're looking for wnb this where the parameters governing the position

1266
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,240
of the hyperplane but now we're saying we will optimize not only the position of

1267
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:41,700
the hyperplane but also

1268
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:45,260
how many points are allowed to violate

1269
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:49,530
the separation conditions and by how far they allowed to violate it so now XII

1270
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:54,200
is also one of the primal variables of the optimisation problem

1271
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:56,550
and if you know compute the

1272
01:28:56,550 --> 01:28:58,550
derivatives of this

1273
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:03,330
to offer new levels in which i haven't written down with respect to w signed

1274
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:07,030
now you get three conditions people we had to

1275
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:12,320
if you substitute these three conditions into the kind of you can get to a

1276
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:16,030
problem but the dual problem doesn't depend on i

1277
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:19,090
just like didn't depend on w b before

1278
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:22,450
so you don't have to worry about twenty at the two dual

1279
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:24,360
more questions

1280
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:36,490
so at the end of the of the optimisation

1281
01:29:36,490 --> 01:29:38,780
all margin errors

1282
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,950
we have enough i so in this case

1283
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:45,970
all margin errors will happen i find that c remember the model there is a

1284
01:29:45,970 --> 01:29:47,670
subset of the support vectors

1285
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:51,720
and all the other support vectors will have the value of five that somewhere between

1286
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,050
zero see but it could also be zero or it could also be seen we

1287
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:59,200
cannot say anything about this we can only guarantee that the margin errors will happen

1288
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:03,240
five which is c or in this case in the new SVM would have enough

1289
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:05,590
i which is one of them

1290
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:09,170
so far the modern errors with the upper boundary

1291
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:19,840
here the new optimizer will the show crash i will not give you results if

1292
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:23,420
the problem is not solvable you don't allow for this

1293
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:25,360
it is solvable

1294
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:32,700
he is actually starting to ask this question me

1295
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,880
go back to this live skit

1296
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:42,130
so it turns out you can interpret the fires as some kind of forces that

1297
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:45,030
you want you want to think of it in terms of mechanics

1298
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:51,280
in this analogy you assume that each support vector exerts a force

1299
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:53,150
of size of i

1300
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:59,340
and direction why i'm on some kind of sheet which is lying along the hyperplane

1301
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:03,590
so you have to support the one class the pushing the one that support vectors

1302
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:08,200
of the other class pushing in the other direction and the size of the size

1303
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,670
of the forces

1304
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:13,050
and i remember we had this constraint here on the

1305
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:15,860
derived by taking the

1306
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:17,610
derivative of the

1307
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:20,590
derivatives of the

1308
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:22,840
primal problem with respect to these

1309
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:28,420
the primal variables so the derivatives of the log on june sorry so the first

1310
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:30,340
one was this equation here

1311
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:34,110
now i remember said that i five i think this is the force and y

1312
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:36,430
is the direction of course this means

1313
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:38,880
all the forces sum to zero

1314
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:41,570
which is one of the conditions for mechanical stability

1315
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:44,150
but in addition

1316
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:51,110
this thing here implies that the torques sum to zero chance of a second

1317
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:54,740
so the second condition which is true at the optimal

1318
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:58,760
implies that the torques sum to zero because we compute the talk so i have

1319
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:04,740
to take the the cross product between the points where the forces exerted and the

1320
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:07,900
size of the force times the direction of the force of this is just a

1321
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:09,860
unit vector along the

1322
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:14,030
normal hyperplane so this is the talk

1323
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:16,900
if you're an engineer offices you probably

1324
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:23,010
know all this but after another this cross product this is by linear i can

1325
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:25,690
move over these alpha i y i

1326
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:27,420
the left side

1327
01:32:27,450 --> 01:32:32,400
and then i see OK this is w again so i have actually w across

1328
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:35,590
divided by something and

1329
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:40,110
the cross product between two vectors that are parallel vanishes

1330
01:32:40,110 --> 01:32:41,650
so mechanically

1331
01:32:41,670 --> 01:32:48,400
the hyperplane lives such that the solution of the optimisation problem is mechanically stable in

1332
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:52,740
the sense of the forces summing to zero and talk summing to zero

1333
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:54,550
does that answer your question

1334
01:32:54,670 --> 01:33:05,470
OK so the mathematical argument is

1335
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:10,220
i guess i mean it's hard to give

1336
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:16,840
mathematical argument is that people have proven that by minimizing this with respect to w

1337
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:20,930
and b and maximizing with respect to the dual variables you do get the solution

1338
01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:23,950
of the problem and so

1339
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,720
it's difficult to say something precise

1340
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:32,010
without going through a lot of algebra here so what i was trying to give

1341
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:37,880
an intuition that these five can take various values there is no upper bound phi

1342
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,170
will increase

1343
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:44,050
and WP will work against it at some point w left change such that the

1344
01:33:44,050 --> 01:33:48,320
point is classified correctly and at that point i would have a certain value which

1345
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:49,760
is then the force

1346
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:56,650
so maybe more questions

1347
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:22,510
it's this is sort

1348
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:25,340
more or to say i would say

1349
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:30,490
we can be the same to be a little bit more precise as to make

1350
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:35,260
the kernel morning non-linear are easier to separate the problems

1351
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,110
and in that case the

1352
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:40,590
the difference between training error and test will increase

1353
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:43,920
so the difference between training error and generalisation error

1354
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:48,400
will increase but of course you might have a problem which is not linearly separable

1355
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:49,380
to begin with

1356
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,700
in that case the linear separation

1357
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:56,220
with slack variables so with a lot of training hours will not do well on

1358
01:34:56,220 --> 01:35:00,820
this problem because if the problem is not linearly separable then linear separation were not

1359
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:05,280
generalize well even though it will probably have the property that the difference between training

1360
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:08,990
and test error small but if the training error is already very large then this

1361
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:12,170
is this isn't isn't going to help you so

1362
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:15,340
but basically you intuition is correct

1363
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:23,530
and more questions

1364
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:26,360
that's what

1365
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,760
his next

1366
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:34,170
so actually then the next thing is something slightly different and maybe

1367
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:41,700
maybe out before the pink

1368
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:44,200
actually no i'll do the

1369
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:48,070
to give you a cluster views logically speaking you could believe some of these things

1370
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:52,060
are not all of them a set of views that many of you probably believe

1371
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:57,060
and i imagine most if you believe that lists some of these things so here's

1372
01:35:57,070 --> 01:35:58,670
the set of common views

1373
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:02,220
first of all that we have also that is to say

1374
01:36:02,230 --> 01:36:08,270
we're not just bodies were not just lumps of bone and flesh but there's is

1375
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:13,470
the part of us perhaps the essential part of us that is something more than

1376
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:18,110
the physical to spiritual immaterial part of us which as i say in this class

1377
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:19,870
will call so also

1378
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:25,350
most of us most of you probably believe in souls certainly most people in america

1379
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:31,600
believe in some sort of immaterial soul and given the existence of the immaterial soul

1380
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:36,720
it's a possibility indeed fear likelihood that we will

1381
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:38,430
survivor deaths

1382
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:42,530
the death will be there in the destruction of my body but my soul is

1383
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:48,240
immaterial and so my soul can continue to exist after my death and whether or

1384
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:51,120
not you actually believe in

1385
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:52,920
so all you

1386
01:36:52,930 --> 01:36:55,450
i hope that there is a soul

1387
01:36:55,640 --> 01:37:02,860
so that they will be this serious possibility of surviving your death because death is

1388
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:07,740
not only bad but so horrible that what we would like to have happen is

1389
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:12,480
we would like to live forever so armed with the soul as it were there's

1390
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:15,640
always the possibility of immortality

1391
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:21,310
immortality would be wonderful that's what we hope is the case whether or not we

1392
01:37:21,310 --> 01:37:23,160
know that it's the case

1393
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:28,520
immortality would be wonderful that's why death so that robs us of immortality

1394
01:37:28,530 --> 01:37:32,730
and if it if there is no soul of death is the and if if

1395
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:36,730
is no immortality this is such an if is no immortality this is such an

1396
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:44,860
the bad thing that the only the obvious reaction the natural reaction universal reaction is

1397
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:49,400
to face the prospect of death with fear

1398
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:51,740
o and despair

1399
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:58,770
as i mentioned earlier than death is so horrible like is so wonderful that it

1400
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:01,140
could never make sense to

1401
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:02,500
throw it away

1402
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:08,590
so suicide is both immoral on the one hand and never make sense is always

1403
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:11,630
irrational as well in addition

1404
01:38:11,650 --> 01:38:17,470
so that they say is i think a common set of views about the nature

1405
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:18,740
of death

1406
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:23,130
and what i'm going to be doing what we are doing in this class is

1407
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:29,650
that that set of users pretty much mistaken from beginning to end

1408
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:35,350
and so i'm going to try to convince you that there is no soul immortality

1409
01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:40,530
would not be a good thing fear of death isn't actually an appropriate response to

1410
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:47,440
death suicide under certain circumstances might be rationally morally justified and say the common picture

1411
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:52,530
is pretty much mistaken from start to end that's at least my goal that's not

1412
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:56,760
my name that's what i'm going to be doing now since of course i believe

1413
01:38:56,780 --> 01:39:01,270
the views i believe and i hope at the end of the semester you'll

1414
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:04,560
i agree with me because i think the true and i hope you want believe

1415
01:39:04,570 --> 01:39:08,750
in the truth but i should say that the crucial point is for you to

1416
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:10,520
agree with me

1417
01:39:10,530 --> 01:39:13,730
the crucial point is for you to think

1418
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:18,770
for yourself and so i really doing is inviting you

1419
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:20,690
to take a good look

1420
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:23,640
hard look

1421
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:30,240
and they sit and think about it in a way that most of us don't

1422
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:36,590
if you look at the end of the semester haven't agreed with me about this

1423
01:39:36,590 --> 01:39:41,170
particular claim with that particular claim so be it out the content i will be

1424
01:39:41,170 --> 01:39:46,350
completely consent but i really is largely content as long as you have

1425
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:52,530
i really thought through the arguments on each side of these various issues

1426
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:54,810
can it be good time to pass around the

1427
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:56,680
the syllabus

1428
01:39:57,090 --> 01:40:02,240
next introductory remarks like today's talk is going to be devoted to business i get

1429
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:06,320
if time permits some philosophy the end

1430
01:40:06,330 --> 01:40:10,270
what about making one more remark about what i'll be doing in terms of this

1431
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:16,100
license classes of philosophy class will basically be sitting here thinking about what we we

1432
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:19,690
can know or make sense of with regard to death

1433
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:27,610
using our our reasoning capacity will be trying to think about death the rational standpoint

1434
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:33,120
one kind of evidence or one kind of argument

1435
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:38,880
that we won't be making use of here is appeal to to religious authority

1436
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:43,620
so some of you may believe in for example the existence of an afterlife may

1437
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:49,480
believe going to survive death you may believe in immortality because that's what you're church

1438
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,540
teachers you and and that's fine

1439
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:53,600
it's not my

1440
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:59,110
purpose or intention here to try to argue you out of your religious beliefs or

1441
01:40:59,110 --> 01:41:05,350
to argue against your religious beliefs all i'm going to ask is that we not

1442
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:11,160
appeal to such religious arguments appeal to revelation or the authority of the bible what

1443
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:17,470
have you in the course of this argument course in this class

1444
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:22,990
if you want to you can think of this class as one big hypothetical what

1445
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:25,710
conclusions what we come to

1446
01:41:25,730 --> 01:41:28,260
about the nature of death

1447
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:35,320
if we had to think about it from a secular perspective making use of only

1448
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:39,040
our own reasoning as opposed to

1449
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:44,420
whatever answers we might be given by divine revealed authority those of you who believe

1450
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:50,220
in divine revealed authority that the debate for another day it's not a debate that

1451
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:56,220
as high as the steady state value so I can take that dataset and plot

1452
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:59,060
the flux at up

1453
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:05,610
x equals x 1 I'm sitting here watching the video profile evolve with time initially

1454
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:08,890
at 0 because there's nothing in the in the

1455
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:11,130
membrane and then slowly rising

1456
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:17,180
and reaches the steady state value so this is this is jay at steady state

1457
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:21,600
here jails steady state and thus

1458
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:23,970
but could be a T 1

1459
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:28,390
23 so you can see that coming off the soul

1460
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:34,700
so clearly when we're moving through this time period J

1461
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:39,200
is very much a function of time because if you close your eyes and wait

1462
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:43,630
you'll see that the profile was changes the profile was changed it means that the

1463
01:42:43,630 --> 01:42:48,900
instant value of fluxes changes of what's a function of time so this is not

1464
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:57,150
a steady state this is not a instead it is transient where in the transient

1465
01:42:57,150 --> 01:43:04,460
regime and transient regime in so far as

1466
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:10,200
is always the case we can draw these curves they start a high value the

1467
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:17,340
attenuated 0 what's the magical question what is the shape and what is the shape

1468
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:19,360
that's only reason mass

1469
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:21,650
to tell me the shape of those

1470
01:43:21,690 --> 01:43:26,840
is is is this an exponential decay is this half of the sign only what

1471
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:33,300
is the shape of the curves I want to know vs. x at all

1472
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:38,950
time at all times because it is changing as a function of time that means

1473
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:43,240
I need to know C as a function of X and T of to solve

1474
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:46,370
this and fit give us the solution of this as well

1475
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:51,000
the solution of this is the solution to an equation

1476
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:55,910
known as fixed 2nd loss so let's look at fixed 2nd

1477
01:43:56,090 --> 01:44:09,130
6 seconds and underwriting the special case when Dean is independent of the composition of

1478
01:44:09,150 --> 01:44:13,840
of the has compositions really do I do next and is a pretty good assumption

1479
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:26,190
in many industrial settings and soldiers the right it's a it's a partial differential equation

1480
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:31,540
and so what is telling you is that the partial with respect to time is

1481
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:37,800
equal to the product of the diffusion coefficient times the partial all of

1482
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:43,980
the gradient in concentration and so clearly this is a partial differential equation and that's

1483
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:49,840
that's that you can't solve this was not yet OK but the good news is

1484
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:55,300
it's a linear partial differential equations and that's good because I can show you a

1485
01:44:55,300 --> 01:45:01,240
solution that applies for a given and then you can play with the boundary conditions

1486
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:06,910
and use the same solution so that's the good news it's linear alright so

1487
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:12,560
but the solution of this is to both in x and the

1488
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:18,450
on the solution looks like the best solution looks like this

1489
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:23,820
but say we have an initial concentration seen

1490
01:45:24,030 --> 01:45:30,510
see is a function of X so I have an initial nonzero concentrations and I

1491
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:35,990
have a surface concentration fixed C S and this is the system that we're trying

1492
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:39,140
to model and the general solution

1493
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:49,190
the general solution to fix 2nd largest city complexity is some constant it was a

1494
01:45:49,190 --> 01:45:54,760
constant b times a function which we're defined for the 2nd the error function dousing

1495
01:45:54,840 --> 01:46:00,000
function of X divided by the square root of d t so these are both

1496
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:08,060
constants to be determined this is the Gaussian error function the error function X is

1497
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:14,820
tedious time and D is the diffusion coefficient and this is nothing but a transcendental

1498
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:20,080
functions that varies from 0 to 1 and here I could have said sign if

1499
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:24,720
I said it signed x over but 2 routes of DT you know that the

1500
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:29,680
definition of science it's got some weird integral and blah-blah-blah nobody pays any attention to

1501
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:34,600
it in August 0 1 it's linear at low values of the so what somewhere

1502
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,020
along the properties of the star

1503
01:46:36,540 --> 01:46:39,740
but I can tell you something right off the bat we think the shape of

1504
01:46:39,740 --> 01:46:45,540
the error function what's the shape of the error function that's the shape that's the

1505
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:50,140
OK that's what methods Matthias

1506
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:51,830
finding the shape

1507
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:58,010
otherwise it doesn't make any sense and 1 of these these scale factors here you've

1508
01:46:58,010 --> 01:47:01,860
done this on a computer where you take some imagine you pull it you stretch

1509
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:05,240
it and so on and you can lock the aspect ratio pride

1510
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:09,780
lock the aspect ratio that's all you're doing mathematically where Paul that's why we got

1511
01:47:09,850 --> 01:47:14,540
call because at a later time it looks like this but the relationship between all

1512
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,410
these points is the same

1513
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:20,780
so that matter does it doesn't

1514
01:47:20,820 --> 01:47:24,610
no matter works for you you know work for

1515
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:29,520
so let's put this thing work lazy so what we do we have to solve

1516
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:31,500
for the now

1517
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:36,650
you know that when you when you differentiate you throw away information right so every

1518
01:47:36,650 --> 01:47:40,240
time we throw away information we need to add some so we need to have

1519
01:47:40,250 --> 01:47:45,690
1 time based boundary conditions and we need to have 2 spatially based boundary conditions

1520
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:50,590
because we threw a 3 bits of information so do and if we go ahead

1521
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:55,090
and do that so here's what the uh and B will solve this works for

1522
01:47:55,090 --> 01:48:03,560
all cases minus the surface concentration divided by the initial concentration minus the surface concentration

1523
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:11,300
equals error function of X over 2 routes of DT so C is that what

1524
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:16,370
you're looking for this seen as a function of X and T C a surface

1525
01:48:16,370 --> 01:48:20,340
concentration of C O is the

1526
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:26,300
the initial concentration and let's take a look at what the function of class so

1527
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:34,820
to be someone graph z of efficiency as a function of z it varies from

1528
01:48:34,820 --> 01:48:35,670
0 to 1

1529
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:41,640
and it starts off like so many functions as linear for low values of z

1530
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:47,900
errf z equals z and in fact up to about 0 . 6 and you're

1531
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:52,840
good to within 1 % errf z equals z within 1 % and they want

1532
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:56,750
not to be sufficient right so we could say well certainly is good many pages

1533
01:48:56,750 --> 01:49:00,740
point to a page that seems to indicate is an important page so we could

1534
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:05,720
just use the in degree but not that of course is is very vulnerable to

1535
01:49:06,330 --> 01:49:10,460
spamming right so i might just create some take sides and they all point to

1536
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:15,160
my home page and suddenly have very high indegree and does that now make my

1537
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:22,330
homepage more important and it should not be so easy to artificially inflate a score

1538
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:25,450
so and the answer seems to be somehow

1539
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:30,010
the that not every in length in link should matter in particular these artificially created

1540
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:34,850
in these but rather what we care about is that the page gets innings from

1541
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:36,640
other documents that also

1542
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:41,250
are important right and then we inherit some of his important so if i just

1543
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:43,580
create arbitrary new

1544
01:49:43,590 --> 01:49:48,930
pages that point to my home page i should gain much from that because these

1545
01:49:48,930 --> 01:49:53,200
pages will have a very very small score and so they can not post my

1546
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,280
score a lot

1547
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:56,890
OK now in the

1548
01:49:57,350 --> 01:50:02,370
the pagerank algorithm is really very simple to understand i mean maybe many of you

1549
01:50:02,370 --> 01:50:07,250
have actually looked at that but i would like you to go anyway here so

1550
01:50:07,250 --> 01:50:11,780
one way is to think of a random so far right so

1551
01:50:11,790 --> 01:50:17,180
you know you're in front of your computer you start at some random randomly chosen

1552
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:21,180
page let's say and then at every step what you do is

1553
01:50:21,210 --> 01:50:25,570
if you look at the available outlinks all of of your page with prob some

1554
01:50:25,570 --> 01:50:26,460
probability of

1555
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:30,790
do that that's in ninety percent of the cases you look at the available out

1556
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:33,320
links and then you pick one of those random

1557
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:36,890
right let's say there for links on the page and currently at cyclic on one

1558
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:41,170
of them with so first with ninety percent of the time it's a look at

1559
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:43,970
the out links and then if there the for

1560
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:48,670
with probability point two five five pick any one of them and then follow that

1561
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:54,270
to the next page then i repeat with some probability one minus it's a probability

1562
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:55,480
point one

1563
01:50:55,500 --> 01:51:01,010
ten percent i randomly chosen new web page where that might be a little bit

1564
01:51:01,010 --> 01:51:05,470
hard to simulate a new machine how do you randomly pick a web page but

1565
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:08,270
you know but if you have access to the whole web you could say simply

1566
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:12,020
say you know give me no random page and then you move to the random

1567
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:15,980
page and the you surface little bit moved to random page seven little bit and

1568
01:51:15,980 --> 01:51:19,920
so on and so forth and the question now is if we do that right

1569
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:24,130
we can ask what is the probability that this surfer

1570
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:26,390
is at the particular page five

1571
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:31,940
as time goes to infinity right or we could also say you know once once

1572
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:38,720
we reach the stationary kind of you know once this this random walk is people

1573
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:42,010
see kind of has makes what is the

1574
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:46,030
probably what is the the the the fraction of time that say that we spend

1575
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:50,520
at a particular page i mean the surface sensitivity to particular page

1576
01:51:50,530 --> 01:51:53,880
OK and that

1577
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:57,840
number that we can get here it's a the probability that is what we call

1578
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:03,140
the pagerank so it is parametrized by this parameter for we can choose somehow

1579
01:52:03,150 --> 01:52:06,890
and we call the patron and the idea is that you know the

1580
01:52:07,290 --> 01:52:08,890
the important pages

1581
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:11,560
i mean they have a lot of in links so there are many ways to

1582
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:13,310
get there and then also

1583
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:19,250
if if they are well connected by other pages that are important right side meaning

1584
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:22,490
that it's also easy to get to them the basically this

1585
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:28,340
simulation really will that that the random surfer will spend more time on

1586
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:30,940
pages that are kind of well connected

1587
01:52:30,970 --> 01:52:34,910
on the web that have a lot of connections going in there and it's not

1588
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:41,040
just kind of artificially created links but it's really main roads that lead their that

1589
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:46,050
connect important pages so anyway that's that's of course is an assumption

1590
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:50,810
but seems to be a good starting point so

1591
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:53,540
formally we can also

1592
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,800
like this so

1593
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:59,220
you know what we really do here what we have here is an markovian random

1594
01:52:59,220 --> 01:53:05,490
walk or simple markov chain if you like that we start with you know we

1595
01:53:05,860 --> 01:53:07,800
know it's a little

1596
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:10,840
so so we we say we denote by q

1597
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:15,400
zero the initial distribution that was

1598
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:22,280
used to select the initial node and if we then denoted by q t

1599
01:53:22,290 --> 01:53:28,640
vector with probabilities every probability indicating the probability to be at a particular page at

1600
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:31,390
time step t right so i think of

1601
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:35,980
q t and q zero as say on the web if we have let's say

1602
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:40,010
ten billion pages this will be a vector with ten billion numbers right for every

1603
01:53:40,010 --> 01:53:42,350
page there will be a number

1604
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:46,140
that at that point in time we will be at that page

1605
01:53:46,870 --> 01:53:51,010
and then if we if we would know that vector at time step t

1606
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:54,560
we could compute it for time step t plus one

1607
01:53:54,610 --> 01:53:56,170
by looking at the

1608
01:53:56,180 --> 01:54:02,710
transition matrix probabilities right so this is a matrix where the entries denote the probability

1609
01:54:03,770 --> 01:54:08,510
we will go to node i went before we need to know j

1610
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:12,510
right so how do i get to a particular node i well i can look

1611
01:54:12,510 --> 01:54:17,440
at all nodes j look at the transition probability p of i j

1612
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:21,980
get two are right and then i just add this up so i look at

1613
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:26,550
all possible nodes what's the transition probability to get to me right and i just

1614
01:54:26,550 --> 01:54:32,980
add up the probability of being there are times this transition probability and that's exactly

1615
01:54:33,010 --> 01:54:35,530
what you can write in this matrix notation here

1616
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:38,880
so you see that so you take that right let's say we looking at that

1617
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:43,910
page one here you take this whole vector the probability to be at page one

1618
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:48,420
times the probability to go from one to one the probability of being page to

1619
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:52,160
the probability of going from two to one and so on and you have

1620
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:55,260
and of course if you just look at that by induction

1621
01:54:55,270 --> 01:55:00,590
you can go back all the way to the initial state and then the state

1622
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:06,410
of the state of this probability vectors here at t plus one is just the

1623
01:55:06,410 --> 01:55:08,410
initial one multiplied by

1624
01:55:08,420 --> 01:55:09,600
the teapot

1625
01:55:09,620 --> 01:55:12,770
once power of that transition matrix p

1626
01:55:12,770 --> 01:55:17,040
and so what we would look for ultimately

1627
01:55:17,070 --> 01:55:22,520
is the stationary distribution that is we would like to find a distribution that reproduces

1628
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:27,590
itself if we multiply with this transition matrix so that p times q is equal

1629
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:29,290
to q

1630
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:31,350
and so

1631
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:34,990
so that would characterize

1632
01:55:35,010 --> 01:55:38,280
let's say there's only one such distribution than that

1633
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:42,620
you know hopefully the kind of the the random surfer model it wouldn't matter how

1634
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:48,150
we would start and we would end up in that stationary distribution at some point

1635
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:52,800
so note that this school q vectors basically is and i can vector of this

1636
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:53,930
p matrix

1637
01:55:54,010 --> 01:55:57,180
in the i can value happens to be one here

1638
01:55:58,490 --> 01:56:05,440
now in the case of pagerank right how do exactly define this transition probabilities well

1639
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:11,560
it's just basically what we said before it's just this random surfer model so

1640
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:17,150
so we have here the probability

1641
01:56:17,170 --> 01:56:19,870
to the page i

1642
01:56:20,610 --> 01:56:22,370
at the next step

1643
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:23,490
is this

1644
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:25,050
so far

1645
01:56:25,150 --> 01:56:26,460
which means

1646
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:31,360
that we follow to an actual link and then we look at all pages that

1647
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:36,670
have edges going from j to i k that point two i

1648
01:56:36,670 --> 01:56:42,400
that is essentially carry influence between out so if i have x

1649
01:56:44,110 --> 01:56:44,920
and c

1650
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:50,130
so in this case everything is marginally independent model independent challenge

1651
01:56:50,150 --> 01:56:53,150
in this case everything is

1652
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:59,500
well marginally dependent meaning but we have something like what we have

1653
01:57:00,270 --> 01:57:02,440
is independent of z

1654
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:04,520
given y

1655
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:11,500
so it is the semantics we want from this thing right so what why does

1656
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:16,670
is is block the kind of the active passive influence from ecstasy think about some

1657
01:57:16,670 --> 01:57:19,040
causal chain one say no

1658
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:23,110
with the value of this thing is for example i know that one ring

1659
01:57:23,130 --> 01:57:25,420
it doesn't matter whether earthquake

1660
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:26,920
i mean it happened or

1661
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:30,880
very what matters rang and that's why i called

1662
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,670
OK so

1663
01:57:33,690 --> 01:57:39,220
there are basically past like that and and so the path of the sword right

1664
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:44,130
you have long been doesn't have to be a chain of three longest chains of

1665
01:57:44,130 --> 01:57:47,840
of course the evidence they can be blocked right so

1666
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
x amount here

1667
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:53,520
after two y

1668
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:57,650
actually is easily asking about x

1669
01:57:57,670 --> 01:57:59,400
you for you give

1670
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:03,690
given y k having something observed here changes in

1671
01:58:03,710 --> 01:58:06,610
blocks this influence

1672
01:58:06,610 --> 01:58:09,690
the same thing happens in the other direction

1673
01:58:09,710 --> 01:58:14,880
right so these are two common cases a directed path between x and z directed

1674
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:22,040
by the way is the next another kind of

1675
01:58:22,250 --> 01:58:26,130
the question

1676
01:58:26,130 --> 01:58:28,650
just get to

1677
01:58:29,090 --> 01:58:30,630
we have something like

1678
01:58:30,650 --> 01:58:34,380
like this saying you know we have x and

1679
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:39,360
right so

1680
01:58:39,380 --> 01:58:44,560
we can assume that that the here is what causes in x and y causes

1681
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:49,360
zero maybe this is the the alarm rate and this is mary and johnk

1682
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:55,020
given the alarm these things are independent not given a large their dependent right so

1683
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:58,040
now consider this kind of path were sort of

1684
01:58:58,090 --> 01:59:05,310
goes against the direction gets somewhere some kind of elbow and then goes again in

1685
01:59:05,310 --> 01:59:08,520
the direction of the aristocrats this kind of

1686
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:15,650
centre in in this way so now we ask what is this kind of pattern

1687
01:59:15,730 --> 01:59:19,130
influence blocked what you know

1688
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:22,000
obviously when this is observed

1689
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,590
OK but then the situation slightly more complex

1690
01:59:28,590 --> 01:59:30,190
x and z

1691
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:36,080
anything here if this is observed or this is observed anything want

1692
01:59:37,150 --> 01:59:43,310
one is a blog this completely independent of so so far this notion is very

1693
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:45,460
much like me under the notion

1694
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:49,110
because it's just it just you know for every path in some

1695
01:59:49,130 --> 01:59:52,840
observed variable in order to kind of bring the influence of one variable on the

1696
01:59:53,730 --> 01:59:57,210
he gets you get

1697
01:59:57,230 --> 02:00:00,060
i can hear is this

1698
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:10,020
he gets interesting when we get to call the structure

1699
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:14,820
so as the name suggests it

1700
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:17,230
the structure of this article

1701
02:00:20,790 --> 02:00:22,750
because e

1702
02:00:23,190 --> 02:00:24,150
and why

1703
02:00:24,150 --> 02:00:29,340
so you can map these mentally to burglary earthquake alarm

1704
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:32,810
right and so

1705
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:34,610
is x and z

1706
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:37,710
marginally independent

1707
02:00:37,730 --> 02:00:42,230
the next question x independent of these churn

1708
02:00:42,250 --> 02:00:48,080
yes but this is true now

1709
02:00:48,090 --> 02:00:50,750
what about x

1710
02:00:50,770 --> 02:00:52,840
given y

1711
02:00:52,840 --> 02:01:02,710
how many will say i think yes

1712
02:01:02,730 --> 02:01:04,730
i mean think now

1713
02:01:04,730 --> 02:01:08,630
OK the sales you'll notice that OK go so

1714
02:01:08,690 --> 02:01:12,730
they are not independent why because there is what's called explaining way that could happen

1715
02:01:12,730 --> 02:01:16,810
right so you know you might think that so if captains

1716
02:01:16,810 --> 02:01:22,320
this is more likely to happen if very happens the alarm is more likely to

1717
02:01:25,130 --> 02:01:26,540
once i know

1718
02:01:31,210 --> 02:01:32,420
alarm off

1719
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:38,040
and i asked myself the question so suppose somebody can tell me what

1720
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:40,960
the earthquake happened or not i can listen to the airport in radio

1721
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:46,730
with mean knowing the earthquake happened change my belief about burglary

1722
02:01:46,750 --> 02:01:48,560
and yes support because

1723
02:01:48,590 --> 02:01:52,500
if i knew the earthquake happened i would explain away the alarm

1724
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:55,420
by the earthquake and the probability of burglary

1725
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:59,590
go down that the kind the kind of common sense reasoning that could happen so

1726
02:01:59,590 --> 02:02:00,960
this common sense reasoning

1727
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:03,840
actually depends on the parameters of the of the

1728
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:07,500
one of the model i mean what i'm assuming is that this kind of

1729
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:11,540
you know positive influence if this is true is more likely to be true this

1730
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:12,460
is true

1731
02:02:12,460 --> 02:02:14,690
this more likely to be true in this case

1732
02:02:14,710 --> 02:02:16,130
explaining away

1733
02:02:16,150 --> 02:02:21,860
occurs and so once you know this these guys become dependent

1734
02:02:21,910 --> 02:02:24,960
more generally if you have know some

1735
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:29,140
a another idea which will come back to eliminate is do we really have to

1736
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:33,940
be satisfied with sampling from the prior is there some other way of generating samples

1737
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:35,030
that would be

1738
02:02:35,070 --> 02:02:39,950
better and so the idea of the proposal distribution

1739
02:02:39,970 --> 02:02:43,220
captures this we that we could kind of many cup a prior in some way

1740
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:46,960
by choosing some other distribution q if only we knew some way of making the

1741
02:02:46,990 --> 02:02:52,380
q that mimics the posterior better than the prior itself did

1742
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:58,830
anyway there are very many variations have arisen on particle filtering sequential sampling many of

1743
02:02:58,830 --> 02:03:00,770
which are trying to

1744
02:03:00,780 --> 02:03:03,660
improve estimator variance by

1745
02:03:03,710 --> 02:03:08,120
increasing this effective sample size and i don't have

1746
02:03:08,220 --> 02:03:10,270
time to go into all of these

1747
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:12,540
but i will

1748
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:14,170
straight one or two

1749
02:03:15,190 --> 02:03:15,940
so this

1750
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:17,990
importance sampling idea

1751
02:03:18,010 --> 02:03:21,200
where you invent a proposal distribution q

1752
02:03:21,230 --> 02:03:23,880
that proxies for the

1753
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:27,680
is is is an effective thing

1754
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:29,850
so in the in the old

1755
02:03:29,910 --> 02:03:35,910
system we simply samples from the prediction distribution but now instead we draw samples from

1756
02:03:35,910 --> 02:03:40,390
this proxy for the prediction distribution

1757
02:03:41,130 --> 02:03:42,230
trickle q

1758
02:03:42,390 --> 02:03:49,370
and now correction has to be made in the computation of the weights so

1759
02:03:49,410 --> 02:03:55,350
the weights previously we just evaluate the likelihood by now we have to also bring

1760
02:03:55,350 --> 02:04:00,650
in a ratio that puts back the influence of the of the true

1761
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:06,010
posterior which is derived from this prediction distribution and discounts the biasing effect if you

1762
02:04:06,010 --> 02:04:10,200
like of the proposal distribution so we divide by that

1763
02:04:10,210 --> 02:04:15,350
and in visual tracking this can be used in a number of creative ways so

1764
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:19,460
the beauty of it is that it allows you to bring in extraneous information for

1765
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:22,440
which we don't have a precise probabilistic distribution

1766
02:04:24,050 --> 02:04:28,560
you use it simply to improve efficiency but not actually to old

1767
02:04:28,570 --> 02:04:34,180
o introduce bias into the field so in this case for example we can measure

1768
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:39,450
skin colour blobs in various locations in the image and we're trying to do and

1769
02:04:39,450 --> 02:04:44,510
tracking so it seems reasonable to concentrate efficiency in the areas where there's

1770
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:48,930
skin colour but i don't have an nice probabilistic model for how skin cover

1771
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:53,770
the position of the hand perhaps i could get one but the point is with

1772
02:04:55,470 --> 02:04:59,620
a proposal distribution mechanism i don't have to bother so now

1773
02:04:59,640 --> 02:05:02,110
what you see is a track

1774
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:08,280
fired off proposals generated in the region of this these colour blobs actually there's a

1775
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:13,130
mixture going on the proposal generated from the colour blobs proposals generated from predictions in

1776
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:14,760
the in the old way

1777
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:17,850
you see that for some reason the skin colour detectors firing a little bit on

1778
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:22,380
the bottom of this coffee cup so it must be the particles being generated there

1779
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:26,320
but they don't ever received any support from the likelihood model so they don't do

1780
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:30,340
any damage except just a slight lowering efficiency but the point is we managed to

1781
02:05:30,340 --> 02:05:32,830
concentrate efficiency so well

1782
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:38,010
compared with the show this video before and explain the

1783
02:05:38,050 --> 02:05:42,200
the importance the importance sampling aspects

1784
02:05:42,230 --> 02:05:44,940
and here's another use the same idea

1785
02:05:44,980 --> 02:05:51,710
this is tracking using motion and colour cues combining the motion and colour together

1786
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:55,510
detection of motion in images is actually quite cheap so

1787
02:05:55,510 --> 02:06:00,920
we can afford to do that over an entire image whereas characterizing colour especially with

1788
02:06:00,930 --> 02:06:05,070
reasonably subtle colour model is more expensive so

1789
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:06,660
if we tried to

1790
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:10,360
track based on emotional only aims to track the face again and the person moving

1791
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:11,120
through this

1792
02:06:11,120 --> 02:06:15,490
the CD apostles of moving stuff the body of the person is moving so that

1793
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:26,920
actually the TV screen is moving so that since proposal the proposal generation here is

1794
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:31,730
done in response to motion we get particles generated on top of the moving screen

1795
02:06:31,730 --> 02:06:34,570
but the other particles the ones that get high support so

1796
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:36,140
this was wasting

1797
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:40,680
samples may not actually doing any damage the estimate the posterior

1798
02:06:41,630 --> 02:06:42,830
we try to

1799
02:06:42,830 --> 02:06:45,120
filter based on colour cues alone while we

1800
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:50,620
you know there isn't time to explore the whole image and so the posterior

1801
02:06:50,620 --> 02:06:56,230
sample generation hangs around uselessly in the corner of the image waiting for something that

1802
02:06:56,230 --> 02:06:57,740
matches the model two

1803
02:06:57,780 --> 02:07:01,730
to come in and then locks onto the model but if we put together a

1804
02:07:01,740 --> 02:07:04,120
motion driven proposal generation

1805
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:07,770
and but the added

1806
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:13,100
evidence from the colour likelihood model then we get something which is more powerful than

1807
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:16,560
you see it's tracking efficiently

1808
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:20,850
picking up on the person rapidly as they come into the room because proposals generated

1809
02:07:20,850 --> 02:07:21,910
from that motion

1810
02:07:23,150 --> 02:07:27,120
tracking efficiently the face as the person moves the room

1811
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:31,610
same idea used to fuse

1812
02:07:31,610 --> 02:07:36,800
sound and colour again the two things are complementary because sound with the stereo microphones

1813
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:40,280
is something where you can explore the whole range of directions from which the sound

1814
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:43,790
like come very efficiently in

1815
02:07:43,810 --> 02:07:48,980
in the video frame in the video frame time but you can't explore

1816
02:07:48,990 --> 02:07:51,490
as i said before the fit of the colour model to all of the possible

1817
02:07:51,490 --> 02:07:57,450
locations in the image in one frame time so we could filter using sound proposals

1818
02:07:57,450 --> 02:08:01,380
and sound likelihood on the basis of the sound alone

1819
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:03,090
and you see it's

1820
02:08:03,090 --> 02:08:04,640
picking up the speaker

1821
02:08:04,660 --> 02:08:07,940
as they talk about the distribution is rather broad and of course
