1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
actually serious but that's okay

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,000
but a series is called

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,550
arithmetic series

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,090
wow that's some sharp people

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,240
can communicate

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,710
this is arithmetic there serious are basically summing one plus two plus three plus four

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,920
some constants in there

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,760
basically is one plus two plus three plus four plus five plus prospects

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,010
up to and that's

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,090
they have an square OK so if you don't know this map

11
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,670
this chapter in the book

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,170
or you could have taken the prerequisite

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,010
prior arithmetic series people have this vague recollection i

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,760
you have to learn these manipulations we'll talk about it next time

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,210
OK but you have to learn your data manipulations for what

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,500
works with data to be very careful because is a weak notation

17
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,920
so strong notation something like like its notation from calculus

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,150
where you the chain rule is just cancelling two things in the

19
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,150
fabulous but you can cancel the chain rule OK

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,510
OK let like this notation just expresses that so directly you can manipulate

21
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,840
data notation isn't like that

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,320
if you think it's like that you're in trouble

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,070
you really have to think of what's going on under the theta notation and it's

24
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,760
more descriptive notation

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,860
he is a manipulative notation there are manipulations you can do with that but unless

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,130
you understand what's really going on under the theta notation

27
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,940
you will

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,630
you find yourself in trouble

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,230
and next time we'll talk a little bit more about the notation

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,860
so is an insertion sort is fast

31
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:59,800
well it turns out

32
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,320
for small and it's moderately fast

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:13,900
OK but it is not at all

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,610
the large

35
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,610
i mean you know fast

36
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,840
especially of insertion sort of

37
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,610
we're not

38
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,190
one right on this later

39
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,300
OK so you taking notes

40
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,150
leave some space and left

41
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,860
here's were sort

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,440
of generating a from one UP

43
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,090
and basically three steps

44
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,380
if n equals one

45
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,670
we're done

46
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,710
sorting one element

47
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,090
so we started

48
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,760
alright OK

49
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,610
so recursive algorithm

50
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,980
otherwise what we do is we recursively

51
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,150
a from one

52
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,280
up to the ceiling of and over two

53
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,170
there're a

54
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,860
of the

55
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,400
ceiling of and over two

56
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,940
plus one

57
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,420
OK so we sort to has the ability of the

58
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:07,050
and then three we take those two lists that we've done and we merge them

59
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:15,510
and to do that we use were subroutine

60
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,840
joshi a

61
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:25,190
he subroutine here

62
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:38,480
it works like this i have to list let's say one of them is twenty

63
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,860
doing this in reverse are seventies i sorted this like this

64
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,510
and then i sought another one

65
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,980
no i do this order but anyway

66
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,190
here's my other list

67
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,510
my tool is that i've sorted

68
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,510
so this is a a one up to a ceiling of another two and ceiling

69
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,690
event over two plus one up to a and the way it will be called

70
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,530
in this

71
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,420
and now to merge these two what i want to do is produce a sorted

72
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,380
list out of both of them

73
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,510
what i do is the first observe where is the smallest element

74
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,070
of any two lists that are already sorted

75
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,780
so in one of two places

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,110
the head of the first list for the head of the second less

77
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,420
so i look at those two elements

78
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,820
and i say which one is smaller

79
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,050
this one is small

80
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,360
so what i do is i output into my output array

81
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,780
the smaller of the two

82
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,460
i cross it off

83
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,860
and now wears the next smallest element and the answer is it's going to be

84
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,800
the head of one of these two lists

85
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,050
so then i cross out this guy put him here circle this one

86
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,380
now i look at these two guys this one smaller

87
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,690
for about one now look at these two guys out our

88
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,550
every step here

89
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,510
is some fixed number of

90
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,480
of operations that independent of the size of the array e step

91
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,150
OK each individual step is just me looking two elements and picking up the smallest

92
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,360
advancing some pointers into the

93
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,550
into the red

94
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,670
so i know where the current head of that

95
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,190
that list is

96
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,500
so therefore the time

97
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:34,260
these were and

98
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,460
one in total elements

99
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:44,800
the time to actually go through this merge

100
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,480
since then minus two

101
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,840
call goes down to we end up with order one down here

102
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,560
what's the height of the tree

103
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:17,280
what's the high in the tree here

104
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,510
every step we're just documenting

105
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,500
the argument by one

106
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,240
so the height is an

107
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,900
OK so to analyse this let's first

108
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,560
up everything that's here

109
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,680
OK so this is just

110
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,830
as we understand what these things are coming from

111
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,820
this is just data

112
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,200
of the summation

113
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,180
OK equals one to and

114
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,500
actually of ck

115
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,750
so that's what's in there

116
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,150
and that's equal to

117
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,080
order and squared that's right arithmetic series is coming from

118
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,300
that were in square

119
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,410
and then all of these things here

120
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,250
are all they want

121
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:25,080
and how many of them are there

122
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,740
their were and actually and data ones

123
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,820
total amount

124
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,820
ran out of space

125
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,240
the total amount will just use appear

126
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,820
two and

127
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,140
it grows

128
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,470
have and

129
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,250
a square

130
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,310
and that's just equal to that events where

131
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,800
so just

132
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,030
to see what the structure is in terms of the

133
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,750
recursion tree

134
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,280
OK so highly unbalanced recursion tree

135
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,580
now i'm going to do something i told you should never do

136
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,880
which is really the best case analysis

137
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,730
OK so this free intuition only

138
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,070
in general

139
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,640
we don't do best case analysis

140
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,410
doesn't mean anything

141
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,130
once we get some intuition for maybe

142
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:42,500
basically it means nothing mathematically because it providing no guarantee

143
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,160
and so this is the intuition

144
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,250
so far really lucky

145
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:12,920
what happens

146
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,080
for partition

147
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,250
what's going to be the lucky case

148
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,330
yes but

149
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,210
all right in the middle

150
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,900
k which is essentially

151
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,180
essentially and over two

152
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,610
and over two

153
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,230
trillion over two and minus one or two ten minus one of the two but

154
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,700
we're not going to worry about the details because we're only doing intuitions

155
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,940
the best case because best case is not what we want

156
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,520
so if that happened what's the recurrence that i get

157
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,270
imagine split exactly in the middle every time

158
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:10,470
and then what happens

159
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,110
so you see that

160
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,590
two times t over to go on

161
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,630
plus the order and time for partitioning bouquet

162
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,160
what's the solution that current

163
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,200
that's log and that's the same as merge sort of occurrence

164
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,850
OK it's which case the master theorem

165
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,740
the case two

166
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,720
and log base

167
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,900
i of two

168
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,400
is into the one

169
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,400
the same so we attack on the extra log n

170
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,970
case two the master theorem

171
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,790
it more

172
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,650
he did it

173
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,470
in two pages just two pages of notes and some years ago i went to

174
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,260
see these things and i was expecting that the discovery the atomic nucleus would be

175
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,660
in leather-bound notebook with gold-leaf writing on the outside and i had to go through

176
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,810
a lot of

177
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,600
security to allow to see the things and then i realize why they brought me

178
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,370
some sheets of paper

179
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,600
click together

180
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,180
nine pencil

181
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,920
obviously have been about myself to raise a few things in my bottom that but

182
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,370
it was very nice was actually quite amazing i want you to imagine so seeing

183
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:44,930
these things for real rather than these copies because it shows the genius relevant had

184
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,040
and we were all told

185
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,660
several the probability that the beam scattered through this angle that angle and we set

186
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,660
students' examination questions on it and we know it takes twenty minutes to answer and

187
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,670
only given five minutes to do it

188
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,160
was how we did it in one line

189
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,840
and what he originally did

190
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,590
i was not think about the alpha particle scattering through random angle but very rare

191
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,800
occasion but it bounced right back

192
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,790
and this is how he thought it through

193
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,770
maybe on the next slide with no unknown OK but large and yet half MV

194
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:28,230
squared off in e over b you recognise half MV squared that's normativity econetic energy

195
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,910
on the right hand side is the product of charges divided by distance which is

196
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,420
you probably recognise

197
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,350
electrostatic potential energy

198
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,640
and what i was doing was very simple he said that you're

199
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,850
we now know atomic nucleus sort of positive charge

200
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,230
and here

201
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,480
and alpha particle also positively charged is moving in towards

202
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,360
he uses conservation of energy and nothing more

203
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,210
when alpha particles very far away from the atomic nucleus

204
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,830
it's not feeling an electrostatic repulsion in the distance is just too big so the

205
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:07,160
energy of the alpha particle is completely connected energy half MV squared

206
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:15,020
the new NET nucleus the more electrostatic repulsion fields to it slows down show

207
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,140
its kinetic energy is dropping

208
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,530
because the electrostatic

209
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,360
repulsion of potential energy is growing the sum total stays the same but the energy

210
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,700
is changing from one form to another tonight's moving again

211
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,350
sure and stop it here

212
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,600
this instant the alpha particle is momentarily at rest it has no kinetic energy the

213
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,480
energy is now totally potential energy the product of the alpha particle charge the nucleus

214
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,780
charge divided by the distance

215
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,780
and that is what the equations

216
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,110
half MV squared the total energy when it was far away people's court to charges

217
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,830
distance when the

218
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,490
came near you could get

219
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,570
he then has the higher mathematics taking the distance of the left to the the

220
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,990
top and so forth and put the numbers in those

221
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,480
the next page on the right-hand side makes a mistake using cross something out

222
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,350
that it highlighted that is long vision which the teachers understand what i'm talking about

223
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,640
the years ago by the students and the clue there was a time before pocket

224
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,930
and that's how we did it and that's how he did it

225
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,600
and imagine that you have writing on the page and you've got

226
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,890
to this point

227
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,470
you putting the numbers in for the first time are going to measure this distance

228
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,960
this is not the size of the nucleus but it is a measure of the

229
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,190
distance on which the nucleus lives

230
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,480
and he finds

231
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,920
six point six divided by ten to twelve centimeters

232
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,350
something of the order of ten to the minus

233
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,020
forty metres

234
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,970
ten thousand times smaller

235
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,420
found the size of an atom that is the moment when the villagers realize atomic

236
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:02,300
the positive charge in an atom is concentrated in a very small region and the

237
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,100
same excitement in because it says

238
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:10,580
since probably radius of atom is of order ten to the minus eight centimetres it

239
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:16,330
is seen that distance of approach to charged centre is very small compared with radius

240
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,780
about that is the moment of discovery

241
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,720
and look at that line again it's very small he's writing is so fast that

242
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,010
it hardly to the horizontal line that is the moment when he realizes

243
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,060
that's the eureka moment

244
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,340
is there

245
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,300
designs how to test this idea by causing geiger mars to work looking at a

246
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,490
whole range of atomic elements measuring scattering from different angles so that students can answer

247
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,450
complicated questions in years to come but that is about the discovery in

248
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,750
metaphorical as well as literal sense he really got to the heart of matter that

249
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,110
that language so all these features are monolingual

250
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,840
i do that for the other language to all these features are now target label

251
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,480
OK so now i've got these pairs and the things really going to make all

252
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,830
this work is canonical correlation analysis i'm sure is familiar to all of you you

253
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,770
may or may not be aware of the probabilistic formulation i'm sure most of you

254
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,190
are there too but i can quickly illustrate why i'm talking about CCA here

255
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,630
if i just had a bunch of vectors like this in the source space

256
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,710
right i might use PCA to describe them to represent them in some way

257
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,920
if i had a bunch of words

258
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,400
features in the target space and the use PCA to describe them too

259
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,980
the problem would be if they actually had pairs they came in pairs like they

260
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,330
do in translation

261
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,900
again the projections onto the subspace will be arbitrarily really unrelated

262
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,560
OK so what i'd like to do is i like to somehow find representations for

263
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,810
the data that correlates them and that's what CC does as i'm sure most of

264
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,150
you know

265
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,830
what i now get like these subspaces where these things are correlated and in particular

266
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,290
in the probabilistic formulation of balkan jordan what i can do is talk about there

267
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,440
being a single language independent latents space

268
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,750
the gives rise to these language specific concepts

269
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,860
OK so this basically means of latent space that i can wiggle around concepts and

270
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,610
out pops source and target translations

271
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,750
OK i need to model the model is very simple i generate source for a

272
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,210
bunch of slots resource words i choose a number of target words

273
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,750
i choose the matching

274
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,690
now i've got some pairs and some unpaired words

275
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,810
for each of the paired words i'm going to take a point in this canonical

276
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,960
space which is language independent

277
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,730
i can get choose that according to some simple distribution

278
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,420
i'm gonna projected to the source and target space

279
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,000
which with some transformation vector that of course i have to learn

280
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,250
plus noise same on the target side transformation plus noise

281
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,540
and that's going to generate all of my parents items

282
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,650
separately i'm going to have some noise model and the source that generates source items

283
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,830
and i'm going to have some noise model on the target to generate target

284
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,860
how i learned as well

285
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,150
and this my friend

286
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,100
so i might want to obtain some posterior matchings that turns out to be bad

287
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,900
because that's intractable and i want to kind maximize my parameters but even if i

288
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,230
had this posteriors i wouldn't know how to find those projections that turns out to

289
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,440
be bad but it turns on this case hardy amies might even better friend

290
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,540
we're finding the best matching is easy with fixed parameters i just look at some

291
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,710
kind of joint likelihood with some with noise

292
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,810
models factored in some way

293
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,400
and if i had to fix matching that i would have paired data even if

294
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,730
it's wrong repaired

295
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,210
and then i can find these parameters of the projection using CCA

296
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,310
OK so what do i do

297
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,860
quick experiment and then that'll be the end here

298
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,310
it is i take the two thousand most frequent nouns i take some text from

299
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,650
wikipedia so they're not translations but they do contain some of the same stuff

300
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:47,310
and i might or might not take a hundred translation it turns out you don't

301
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,730
need this these experiments have in the evaluation is going to be some kind of

302
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,250
the precision at some recall the reason why you recall o recall like thirty percent

303
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,080
because that's as good as the baseline seventy do

304
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,790
OK so if i use edit distance on englishspanish which is particularly easy case

305
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,500
i get sixty one percent because there are a lot of very similar words especially

306
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,460
if however i simply use features of the orthography

307
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,860
this kind of alternating learning with and ccn matchings gets meet eighty percent

308
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,170
so does looking at the context without any information about the spelling of the words

309
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,710
at all

310
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,020
this is surely context

311
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,230
if you put them together they stack

312
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,380
so this is a huge improvement over previous work which was not able to be

313
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,150
the edit distance based on

314
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,940
here's kind of precision and recall of edit distance drops very quickly is you get

315
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,810
out of the space of cognates

316
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:49,880
precision is much higher for much longer with this matching CCM

317
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,110
you might say that's not fair started with some select seconds well what happens if

318
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,940
we just take the lowest edit distance words as the seed

319
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,190
it turns out that works almost as well

320
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,670
o thing somewhat robust in that case

321
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,710
and the last thing i want to show you some examples of what's learned because

322
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,330
i think they really need

323
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,790
so these are the most confident non identical matches of course the most confident ones

324
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,440
the ones that occur in the same contexts and there are also identical string identical

325
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,230
here's some cases that are more there that are of course the cognates

326
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,020
for the spanish courses are going to be at the top but you are non

327
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:28,870
sports practice something we will allow that so please stick to the sections and right

328
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,220
now we're because the birth of burgeoning enrollment we've opened up

329
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,050
some sections of these three are underpopulated so if you'd like to switch into one

330
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,570
of these three

331
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,670
they have

332
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,580
very low numbers right now there's we've added an extra one eleven

333
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,440
extra one and two

334
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,150
and we've added one one o'clock

335
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,420
if that nature schedule

336
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,480
are in a better manner than

337
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:01,240
i can do it but only with permission from hillary glory

338
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,360
oh by the way talking about on one hundred rolled

339
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,920
subjects the complementary subject offered by

340
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:16,400
called history society and solid state chemistry needs two days on thursdays at eleven

341
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,580
two one thirty six

342
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,450
it is underpopulated right now so if you're still shopping for

343
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,560
humanities subject this one bears the pressure CI i h designation

344
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,900
think about that if it's a question about the time that

345
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,400
then perhaps raise with the instructor and see if if you're talking to smaller people

346
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,470
i suspect

347
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,150
enrollment is going to be

348
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,610
doesn't so

349
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,970
it could easily be

350
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:49,690
re-arranged if if the time is conflicting one of the other classes

351
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,560
three on one is different

352
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,030
i give homework as learning a i give homework and you see you have more

353
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,190
questions with model solutions at the outset

354
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,220
i want you to learn why

355
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,100
studying the homework i'm not going to have you

356
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,950
work long hours

357
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,950
on difficult problems to be submitted and then great

358
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,920
i don't do that

359
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,420
part of this is designed to

360
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,820
get you to start thinking about the transition from high school

361
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,980
the college

362
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,800
what i mean by that is i want you to take ownership of your learning

363
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,160
so i'm not going to come around and say did you do your homework

364
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,410
good evidence that you didn't do it because you didn't turn it is

365
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,150
so it's easy

366
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,040
it's easy to blow it up

367
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,970
and and those of you have a lot of chemistry for the first allows the

368
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,420
lottery going get complacent

369
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,640
don't do it

370
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,940
develop good study habits the homework is good

371
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,070
test that

372
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,330
make the time

373
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,350
to work the homework problems

374
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,080
but just to make sure to stimulate interest

375
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,730
every tuesday

376
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,190
in recitation there will be a ten minute quiz based upon the content of the

377
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,260
so if you were to problems

378
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,640
do the homework quiz handling

379
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,460
if you haven't looked at the homework problems might have difficulty with homework with

380
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:18,730
there is no homework grade based on turning homework in the the homework portion of

381
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:24,180
your total grade is the aggregate of all of those weekly test scores and you

382
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,500
must take the test

383
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:31,310
if you fail to take the test you get zero and i average to zero

384
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,590
if you don't make it to class

385
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,450
contact your CA your recitation structure and you can take a make up within a

386
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,280
week at the time of the

387
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,740
the original test

388
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,760
i want to give you every chance that

389
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,190
get caught

390
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,910
it's your education i want you to take ownership of

391
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,650
so all scores counted no dropping of lowest scores from the average

392
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,270
some of the other class is perhaps to do this

393
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:04,740
people have actually confronted me telling me it's an MIT rule

394
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:09,200
i've been here twenty six years i i know what the rules

395
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,130
OK so you homework is only number one

396
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,150
so it's assigned today

397
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,490
you've got the model solutions

398
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,220
and they'll will be a test recitation

399
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,000
on tuesday the fourteenth based upon

400
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,500
at homework

401
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,660
it is based upon the homework sections so i don't want somebody coming in with

402
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,880
an attorney sank

403
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:33,600
well the question looked a little bit like thirty nine but it's not exactly

404
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,060
i think you don't say

405
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,180
let's continue with the administration

406
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,580
in addition to the weekly homework

407
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,690
there will be

408
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,680
monthly tests

409
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,050
monthly tests and they've all been scheduled

410
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,210
so you can plan

411
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:55,510
monthly tests are the following dates

412
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:59,080
september twenty nine

413
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,290
october twenty seven over seventy

414
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,400
the test will be written

415
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,150
the normal class period

416
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,190
i know your you

417
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:13,450
harold is bonding and orientation period but you know i think that it's much better

418
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,370
when you write a test for there to be some solid state defects known as

419
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:21,690
vacancies in between the various people so when on the day of the test will

420
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:26,440
have shadow rules and will divide some of your writing here and some of you

421
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:32,050
right some of the other rooms which arise during the class period of fifteen minutes

422
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,710
likewise the

423
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,180
VHS running from

424
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,150
one o five one fifty five two different tests

425
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:46,240
of comparable difficulty i did this last year and that's the

426
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,990
the difference in the scores on all three test was less than one percent

427
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,170
so i think we were capable of

428
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,230
with the kind assistance of my

429
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,050
staff capable of sitting exams of comparable difficulty

430
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,450
but again you be required to go to the world

431
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:05,830
the assigned otherwise we don't have enough seats test papers and so on

432
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,810
by the way on the tasks you will be getting tomorrow these handouts that you

433
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,710
can use in working horse

434
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,780
so when you're taking the test you're allowed to bring in and

435
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,760
the copy of the periodic table of the elements

436
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,220
we give you a very rich

437
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:25,090
table of constants that's got all kinds of things from the mass of the electron

438
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,530
four age and for car power we have three fuzzy

439
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:34,230
fuzzy sets for age young old or middle-aged whatever you call that i prefer to

440
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,940
consider myself normal instead of middle-aged and then car power

441
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,590
so medium and high

442
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:47,550
every everything below if you could the forty seven horsepower and then somebody is medium

443
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,710
sort of the golf to see this and then appeared to get all these highly

444
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,590
tuned cars and then our output but he also loved the three membership functions could

445
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,970
be more doesn't really matter low medium high risk but we've been doing if it

446
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,750
was a different story got this into some sort of a premium calculator that uses

447
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,050
this fuzzy sets all the should pay

448
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,750
two in the next year or something for his insurances

449
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,110
but that's actually something we'll talk later about OK and then the fuzzy rules that

450
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,490
describe a here if age is young and car power is high then risk is

451
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:22,130
high is sort of this imprecise region of right and then and then the than

452
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,390
the guy is sitting down here in this is barely eighteen just got his driver's

453
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:31,550
license and has form of course our portal to the inheritance from his dead father

454
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:35,270
then it's clear this rule is fulfilled to a degree of one there's no question

455
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:40,990
about that so we don't need to bunch down here some of the areas are

456
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,270
got a little bit because to be but actually he's be

457
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,310
thirty three years something so we assume he is a little bit of sense so

458
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:52,690
maybe should really get such a high degree of fulfilment for this particular rule so

459
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,550
the world still holds the two very low degree right so we have this grey

460
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:02,570
zone here with the world stops stops being true and tried to paint here another

461
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:07,970
will saying bonds ages and car power is medium these tools will also overlap in

462
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:12,410
this country space and the some area here we would have both will be true

463
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,650
to degrees

464
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,090
that's one way of doing it

465
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:22,190
the other version are again come rules TSK rules where the antecedent again is a

466
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:27,790
conjunction of fuzzy membership but the consequent is simply a real valued function

467
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,610
of the input variables

468
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:35,790
i'd say taking some sort of a linear function or sometimes pollen on real function

469
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,090
five degrees of some sort of pollen on degrees are to do

470
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,360
one of the input variables

471
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,090
again here my drawing capabilities

472
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:48,110
and so very well we could looks like like something if age is young and

473
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:53,030
car power is high then risk factors some rates zero plus

474
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,900
w one times age plus w two times car power to have some sort of

475
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,330
a little local model that we use in this area

476
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,810
and here

477
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:09,070
painting three-dimensional surfaces it's not really my thing but anyway so he would have some

478
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:14,150
w zero here are some offset the risk factor this is our function w one

479
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:19,650
times age is linear function with respect to have linear function with respect to car

480
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:24,990
power w two times car power and then in fury for this world then they

481
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,890
will high young sort of down here is true he would get some sort of

482
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:36,470
inclining field to end up these three things see if offset w zero here and

483
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,830
then it goes up with this slope along

484
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:43,070
the axis car power and with this slope along risk factor in the middle it's

485
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:49,450
next sort of have the minerals surface that becomes activated when that will destroy and

486
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:55,150
that was the old people like to use these types of models even though they're

487
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:59,250
obviously not it's easy to read the previous one i mean the previous one something

488
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:05,570
centimeter risk high need to interpret these are easier though to just stood up to

489
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:10,050
date and that to right because you can actually fiddle with these parameters

490
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:20,110
OK so the point morris we can have sort of mentioned earlier you can towards

491
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,610
so of many many fuzzy rules that you're building for example something like if age

492
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,510
is young and car power is high then risk is high age small and car

493
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:33,840
power is medium then this is medium is that the standard driver normal ancient old

494
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,950
guys then again get high risk so but how do you draw inferences from such

495
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,990
such systems rules

496
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,370
if you can plot both of them

497
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,070
next to each other we can essentially

498
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,030
planning our measurements we have some some values for inputs

499
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:00,610
well first of all OK this just the membership functions that are of interest for

500
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:06,690
one young high and high for age car power and risk normal medium medium age

501
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:10,750
car power and risk will are two so that's just illustrating here but what happened

502
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:15,230
so you have these fuzzy fire crisp inputs

503
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:20,030
so we are now measuring something never client walking into our insurance company is eight

504
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,110
is twenty nine years old he's he's trying to get insurance for a car that's

505
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:31,050
a hundred and ninety what parts whatever it is a small downscaled corvette we need

506
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:35,490
to figure out the degree of fulfilment for these rules and then somehow combine

507
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:40,870
these and this consequence of this is what do we do first the first thing

508
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,630
you can do is find degrees of membership for these fuzzy sets we can find

509
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,930
out well how much does he belong to the set of young people how much

510
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:51,290
does he belong to the set of normal people how much does it car belong

511
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,230
to the

512
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,990
so the medium power cars to the high-powered cars

513
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,450
that's easy that's what they did before i just use the fuzzy sets to compute

514
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:02,090
degrees of membership so that the degree of membership to the set of young people

515
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,110
point eight

516
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,240
but i'm going to talk about is

517
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,390
given an image like this one

518
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,540
we want to build systems that are able to interpret what is going on here

519
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,750
there are many things that you can do with a picture

520
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,970
for instance you can the segmentation

521
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,190
and you know so the object label in you can find it put labels to

522
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,830
objects that on the picture

523
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:26,010
you can also give a little description of what is going on this in this

524
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:30,900
is a nice view of power canonize spring day you can also try to do

525
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,190
much more high level interpretation of what is going on the picture like this some

526
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,210
people walking on the street there is some life in the that science saying that

527
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,510
just remember feeling that that's probably this guy doesn't know how to read so that

528
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:46,090
a lot of inferences that you could start making all this picture

529
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,110
you could also belongs to the data representations connected to be

530
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:53,670
model of the scene and infer that that's exactly on top of the graph the

531
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:57,290
people in the shadows of the trees and so on

532
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,790
in this tutorial i'm going to focus mostly on the recognition by there are many

533
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,630
of the things that are not important in this assumption standard but i will focus

534
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,680
mostly on condition aspects

535
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,790
why is that we can all recognition of course we can see the three d

536
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,070
of a picture book and a lot of things without having to put labels to

537
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:21,700
but when you put the label something this concept of category encapsulates a lot of

538
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,370
a lot of knowledge will be able to do it tells you what can you

539
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:29,120
do with the object but functions can accomplish that object for instance for this animal

540
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,950
here looking at the laptop probably he has different intentions that what you will have

541
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,480
to drive looking at the laptop

542
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,530
so if you can see the three d he knows until the surfaces that are

543
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,510
building this computer but you know what to do with it

544
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,980
in fact the perception of function

545
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,670
is really something fundamental innovations so this is a quote from vision science book of

546
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:53,070
parliament in which he says that we include perception of function as a proper congressional

547
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:57,700
subject for some reason science so this is what i'm going to focus mostly about

548
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:02,730
and of course the people that think that the condition can be not necessarily done

549
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:07,680
through labeling but you can actually do the perception like this is the theory of

550
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,570
and give some in which you will

551
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,820
look at the other will extract some information about the surfaces that compose this scene

552
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:19,410
and from that you can decide things like OK that's not some sort of the

553
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:24,290
four is at the right height therefore i consider it in the or theory is

554
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,380
the mediated perception and that's the categorisation

555
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:31,110
you will take the picture you will start some properties from it you will recognise

556
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,330
that this is the chair and therefore you will conclude that can sit on it

557
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:38,260
and you know it just something like these kinds of devices such as this is

558
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,200
the chair but is this is chair

559
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,510
certainly can sit on it but probably other people will never happen to that

560
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,540
and some aspects of an object function can be perceived directly

561
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:55,850
and there are some some aspects of the function of an object that the directly

562
00:35:55,850 --> 00:36:00,570
come from the shape it has notified concept sit on top of something the fact

563
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:05,470
that something can contain some liquid for instance that you can cut with some device

564
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,980
all those kinds of things that you can infer that from the shape

565
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:14,000
so here you could decide that all these have surfaces you can sit on but

566
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,290
sometimes noted that surface in which it doesn't look like you can see but there

567
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,570
is still a chance

568
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:25,230
i also like like just seems also have affordances they also have functions like you

569
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,010
have three kinds of scenes one is going to tell you that you can

570
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,020
you can write on it and only the college here another one is the place

571
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,800
in which you can have fun with your friends and then another census in which

572
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,630
you want to lie down and you see these fluffy piece of cloth you want

573
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,670
to just lie there and sleep so it also has functions

574
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,350
in some cases the function of a single just like an object can be also

575
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:53,690
be perceived from the from the shape of the space has like in this case

576
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,170
you see especially when there is basically only one thing you can do you can

577
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,040
only move forward so in this case the space is telling you what you can

578
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,270
do with it

579
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:04,950
here again you see an open space the space is telling you that you can

580
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:09,700
run very fast journey to recognise what it is you will just do it

581
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,260
and there are some aspects

582
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,760
that of an object of of function that are going to be of service dependent

583
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,650
so you can not just directly inferred from object what you can do with it

584
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,450
like the case of the of the data

585
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,470
from a couple of the idea of what to do with it you can find

586
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,340
all kinds of things on the web now

587
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:34,550
so propose perception has many limitations so one of the limitations is that in some

588
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:40,630
objects may have very similar structures and is still very different functions this is a

589
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:45,940
picture taken from the book of byzantines book parliament in which two objects they look

590
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,280
very very similar both have a hole in which you can put things inside but

591
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,050
they have very different functions

592
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,520
the bozeman is not suspect in for you to put rational this one here

593
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,740
so i you put the latter in this one he certainly is not going to

594
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,130
rise to the estimation

595
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,130
so there are many different functions

596
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,380
and again i go to the web to confine people that has been a mixed

597
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,740
here is another example of a scene

598
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,280
like an elevator if you know this is an elevator

599
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,760
well this just looks like a box you can get inside and there is absolutely

600
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,160
no reason to believe that you will get everyday life and i don't have them

601
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,410
unless you know what it is for

602
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:27,120
so the perception is not going to work most of the cases you really need

603
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,450
to recognise things

604
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:33,410
so i'm going to start with a very short introduction to object recognition because you

605
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,010
know this way is an important building block in this way we just get rid

606
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,570
of it as soon as possible and get into the interesting things

607
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,380
so the first question is

608
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,460
OK there a lot of people walking around is shown in the first question that

609
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,590
we may have this is this really difficult task is really so hard

610
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,650
so let's say that we start with the model of an object like this one

611
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,090
and our goal is to find the chair on an image like in this one

612
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,260
and so the simplest thing that you can do is to a scan

613
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,700
looking for the chair at all different locations and scales in this image so the

614
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,890
simplest way i can do just apply normalized correlation template matching in this case so

615
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,500
just take a window

616
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,860
and this is a very standard started in detection is called the sliding window approach

617
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:19,060
and we just by normalized correlation to each location

618
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,450
and at the end you will get an output

619
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,490
with a peak

620
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,130
the location where the object is and in this case you know you detect the

621
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,770
object but it was supposed to be because you have a perfect copy of the

622
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,510
idea of trying to find

623
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:36,070
of course place my the two are generally much under the same idea

624
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,780
just by normalized correlation just don't get anything

625
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:42,180
and this is when i was making this you always have this

626
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:46,700
moment of being afraid what happens if it works how to use the final fifty

627
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,760
years of research and of the commission with of course it doesn't work it just

628
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,130
by normalized correlation of a template like this is just give you garbage none of

629
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,540
what happens next

630
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,230
it still

631
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,530
relying upon

632
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,970
a more powerful mechanism for the interaction with the world

633
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,840
it is

634
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,780
this is not good theory standpoint

635
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,930
but it's essentially

636
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,750
as it what we know how to do it

637
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,050
OK so

638
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:19,100
it turns out that if you just have a generative model

639
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,520
it is possible

640
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,890
the perfect samples

641
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,840
in order to learn this natural policy

642
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,220
it turns out

643
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,510
the process of getting the samples is a little bit

644
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:38,370
rotten sense of you need to

645
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,190
query this generative model many many times

646
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,270
the way is

647
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,630
the very first action

648
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:51,110
sample k time so our case some prior so this is the first action so

649
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:54,640
i go here and then i'm going to do something go here and i'm going

650
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:59,380
to do something go here and then we do something stiller again was first action

651
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,550
then for every

652
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,820
primary result of this first action

653
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,800
for every next possible actions

654
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:11,820
use case things k times again

655
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,370
and then very result

656
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,750
in every

657
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:20,690
next action he things he times again

658
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,710
this is a very exponential tree

659
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:33,640
so we're going to actually initiate and both the set of actions in on k

660
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:38,170
so this is something like what the tree looks like to force you drive because

661
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:43,830
it it kind of explodes too fast as opposed to actions in case four

662
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,530
there are four times you keep the first action

663
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,630
and then depend upon each of these outcomes

664
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,450
you have

665
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,480
two actions available to us to each action four times

666
00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:00,670
and then depend upon these outcomes each action four times of three

667
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,830
can only draw down two

668
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,530
is inserted

669
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,240
actually visible

670
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,250
so the i'm assuming for now the generative model is is true

671
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,520
generative model it as

672
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,880
actual has access to this this the

673
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:33,230
you can of course relaxes so little bit to have some approximate access but to

674
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:39,040
pretty good proxy access

675
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:58,780
it's true

676
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,380
and guess

677
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:08,390
the meaning of noise is a little bit

678
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,700
but suppose that

679
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,540
i have the time

680
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:22,230
machine learning summer school if you look at the door and then walk left there's

681
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,850
in half the time if you look at the door lock right this food

682
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,940
and that is sort of interpreters and i suspect two the learning as long as

683
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,420
which way to go is not

684
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,370
maybe the

685
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,780
the world itself is deterministic

686
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,590
but your lack of knowledge is treated as

687
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,290
it is

688
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:50,290
this is the probability of the outcomes

689
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:56,490
i think there is something

690
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,930
important to think about here which is

691
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,050
but we're always trying to come to think about our this work and the worst

692
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,000
it's not really clear that

693
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,150
the world is a very adversarial

694
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,610
and if we can

695
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,530
better think about how to capture the fact

696
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:20,480
it may be that we could get better analysis

697
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,570
so i guess in particular if you if you have an actual deterministic world

698
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:32,460
what happens is

699
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,570
you don't need to

700
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,290
simple k times

701
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:45,150
right two disconnected state of interactions in our actions and k

702
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:51,770
OK so we have this huge super exponential tree right

703
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,860
and the question is how do we actually

704
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,840
there are one of these samples

705
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,170
one is positive samples

706
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,050
what we do is essentially we run

707
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:09,110
we run this dynamic programming step i talked about earlier

708
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,820
on this trip

709
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,630
which are the bottom of the tree

710
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,230
taking expectations

711
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,730
so at the bottom of the tree

712
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:22,570
we're taking action and what to throw and then

713
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,630
we got our reward associated with each of these

714
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,380
different choices

715
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,980
so we taking expectation

716
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:34,130
for fixed actually taking expectations over the rewards we observe

717
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,070
right this is going to be a pretty good experts on this case reasonably large

718
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,150
of are expected

719
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:44,630
and then we have another action

720
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:47,070
and then we take the maximum over these

721
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,550
and then

722
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:54,610
we back up the tree right so

723
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,590
if we take

724
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:00,440
this actually end up with this history of observations

725
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,340
we know

726
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,000
which action

727
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,360
we know approximately which action

728
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:12,610
to choose and we know the value of that action in terms of expected summary

729
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:15,440
were suspected once every word

730
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,250
and then

731
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:18,690
one or here

732
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,020
look for each of the soviet union action

733
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,000
and then we have the next step

734
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:27,730
so we know the expected return

735
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:29,750
if we end up with that history

736
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,210
so in the expectation over

737
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:38,440
or the expected returns across the reward we observe taking this transition

738
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:43,750
and then we take an axe over the actions of this quantity

739
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,360
you just back the tree

740
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,810
we've done and

741
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,040
but there are some constraints

742
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,640
in optimisation problem

743
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,280
what is our constraints

744
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,920
for every one of these local function

745
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,560
the sum over access should be one

746
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:10,450
why because local functions in the case of vision that the probability function

747
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,200
factors here

748
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:18,890
in the case of vision that the conditional probability function p of access

749
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:21,380
x i give

750
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,840
is a conditional probability

751
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,720
so basically

752
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,150
what happens is that

753
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:34,080
these should be one

754
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:39,500
four bayesian networks for all s for all sets of children given parents

755
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,290
the sum of children given paris one

756
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:47,390
so you need to enforce the constraints in europe timisation problem

757
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:53,540
holding force the constraint optimisation problem

758
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:55,920
the end

759
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,850
lagrange multipliers

760
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,950
who has heard of lagrange multipliers

761
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,460
who remembers what they

762
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,840
it's very simple right so basically what happens is that

763
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:14,040
adding a lagrange multiplier if you want this quantity

764
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,050
two if you want is to hold

765
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,580
these constraint called

766
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:21,310
the trick is the following you just ride this constraint

767
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,730
this quantity minus one equals to zero

768
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,690
anywhere that into the optimisation problem

769
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:34,520
you're not changing the optimisation problem because you've added zero to the optimisation problem OK

770
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:39,720
and then you multiply that zero by some london

771
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:45,250
as you you need one lambda for every one of the additional terms that you

772
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,030
now we have another

773
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:49,680
to solve

774
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,920
so essentially now

775
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,330
you have to solve

776
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:59,650
if the as in the fourier london well

777
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:03,200
now the equations that you have the following this is the first question you're going

778
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,010
to zero sorry there's a problem here there should be is you have to do

779
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,510
is equal

780
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:11,110
these gradient should be equal to zero

781
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:16,660
this guy goes to see we've seen that we get these expressions and is one

782
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:20,400
so have as many of these equations as there are cliques

783
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:24,950
or in this case as there are sets of children parents

784
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:33,550
but we also have as many constraint equations as there are

785
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:36,270
children that so we have two times

786
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:40,430
here as it is just the number of

787
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,350
click on in this case the number of sets of children parents

788
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:49,090
how big system of equations

789
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:59,270
but what about what

790
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:07,050
um in fact

791
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:14,370
we are going to log off at OK

792
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:21,960
know that

793
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,190
that's right

794
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:43,210
the result was just

795
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,280
we need

796
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:54,200
to enforce here

797
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,640
the constraints on theta

798
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:01,990
so basically if they cannot have any value this probability distribution on one's true

799
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:05,710
it needs to be positive as well

800
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:07,400
so let me

801
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:10,140
see what the

802
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:34,270
OK so this OK cities later just r

803
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:37,640
but essentially you don't need to enforce it is positive

804
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,400
the moment here too

805
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:46,090
going to be just representation of the image and so you have like a filters

806
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:50,510
into a different orientations for scales and you divide image into four by four b

807
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,520
is just going to have five hundred dimensions and that that is going to be

808
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,540
your presentation for the entire image

809
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,330
basically this is very similar to SIFT but instead of being applied to local patch

810
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:04,160
is applied to the entire image of the ones

811
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,590
another the idea is to

812
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,850
use textons

813
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:12,800
here are what people will do so this was introduced by jitendra belong to show

814
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,170
the large and david is that they can emerge japan this image through a banque

815
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,240
of filters

816
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,860
two two different orientations in this case and also with different elongation

817
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:29,170
and at each pixel you're going to have a bank backed off if the responses

818
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,140
just like a means

819
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:35,110
to all those filter responses to all these vectors on a a very large database

820
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:38,100
and just douglas a hundred cluster centers

821
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,030
and those are going to the find your basic atoms

822
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,920
and then now when you have a new image what you do is you apply

823
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:49,670
all these banker filter do look for each location what is the center plaster that

824
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,500
this kind big excel and we'll histogram

825
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,500
and that's going to be integer for that image and now you have two images

826
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,810
the comparison will be dealt with something like a square or strong intersection

827
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:02,670
and that's what how do we compare images

828
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:08,270
similar idea is just about awards and special pyramid matching

829
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,360
so here are people choose be visual words interviewed by civic system and and basically

830
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,920
here the the idea is that you take

831
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,630
the image to like SIFT descriptors to compute c descriptors at all locations

832
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:24,460
and is the same idea but with text and to take its pick so the

833
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,980
SIFT descriptor defined vectors apply k means

834
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:33,400
and then it speaks of place the pixel value the color value by the the

835
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,360
index to the cluster centre that it gets closer to the descriptors

836
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,380
so that what you will just representation

837
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,860
and the way that images will get described is you image this is this called

838
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,630
scale send the colors them in this to the cluster centers

839
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:53,130
and so you will have a vector that is the histogram the council how many

840
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,090
times each particle of what appears

841
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:00,020
and then you can divide also the mentioned to by two and create histogram for

842
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:04,560
each window this will give you some idea of the spatial distribution of the pictures

843
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:08,760
you can do this in a finer grain and you get more histograms and then

844
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,150
we can concatenate all these different descriptors and that will give you a description of

845
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:16,810
the image that contains both global and local information of the picture

846
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:22,360
so the question now is OK there are all these different representations they have very

847
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:27,060
similar flavors all of them and most of the details are really technical details there

848
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:32,080
is nothing conceptually the about what is the difference between these techniques although the performances

849
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:36,900
differ by greatly because of these details but the question now is OK call for

850
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,830
tender go on this task and you have to do scene recognition using this kind

851
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:45,560
of descriptors without having to explicitly is precisely represent objects

852
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,290
so one of the benchmarks in order to test this task is the fifteenth in

853
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:57,440
category is said in which the advertising categories here they are offices skyscrapers oberst building

854
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,730
for science goes forest and so on

855
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:04,880
and this episode has been put together over time by asking the one and then

856
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:09,750
fifi and marketing reasons relentless and make them more categories against

857
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:13,520
to get to fifteen categories and the task is given an input image you have

858
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,830
to decide which of these categories it belongs to

859
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:22,730
so here i'm showing the performance is that you get with a few approaches in

860
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:28,040
this case and combining a pyramid match in the GS about awards and just using

861
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:36,020
pixels just arbitrary values for the fifteen scene categories here performance will be like that

862
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,980
one now

863
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,460
values of the confusion matrix

864
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,710
and you can see the

865
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,690
OK pixels do very badly

866
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:47,210
so i do values this doesn't do very well just do as imagined by the

867
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:51,770
doing this is the so surface what difference between color values that doesn't do very

868
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:57,110
well so is good is that we have room to improve with the structure and

869
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:01,710
and when use the approaches they all do more or less the same

870
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:06,330
and what is interesting is the the latter part of images that they find difficulties

871
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:10,110
and very very similar to the same categories have found difficult by the same by

872
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,500
all all the models so they all call it a lot

873
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,830
the performances fluctuate between general ten percent and so on

874
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,750
and here is just showing another plot in which a show

875
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:25,020
recognition rate as a function of number of training samples

876
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:31,530
where we have collected statistics about car accidents in rainy weather

877
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:34,250
so we have two random variables again

878
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,010
are being

879
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,560
or not train

880
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,590
car accident or not car accident

881
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,880
and again we have to wait of

882
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:51,820
raising this joint probability distribution as the the probability

883
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,540
training given that it's

884
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:59,500
the brevity of training times the probability of having x and given that it's raining

885
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,000
probability of

886
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,260
excellent given the probability of

887
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,690
rain even accident

888
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,040
this one

889
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:15,270
it doesn't feel natural you could estimate if you have the statistics you can go

890
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:19,140
back and compute the probability of rain given accent

891
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:24,440
counting the number that thing to say OK this state was training testing out but

892
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:29,820
it really doesn't look like the natural way of doing things so

893
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,690
there is that we prefer one of the two

894
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,480
the composition like being more

895
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:39,130
so the one that is showing

896
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:43,610
our believe and how you it should be

897
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:45,820
he composed and so again

898
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,190
we have this graph

899
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,940
we a

900
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:55,250
node representing the random variable for the rain and one four

901
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,480
the accident

902
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,070
that's what happened when we have

903
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,580
three random variables

904
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:07,440
now i have collected statistics for car accidents in when were and also

905
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,130
i have statistics on my neighbour going

906
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:14,570
two the movie the other when

907
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:16,980
have tree random variables

908
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:23,520
the rain rain rain accidentally accident and is my my never going to this to

909
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,510
the movies or not

910
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,380
as you can see there is six way of

911
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:35,180
the composing this joint probability distribution by applying the

912
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,130
for the role

913
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,950
let's say i i i order

914
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,440
the random variables

915
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:46,070
and always the same procedure two

916
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,750
to decompose it so taking first and last

917
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:53,440
the first the last variable and so on

918
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:58,230
so i can have rat art track and there's a lot of physics

919
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:00,060
but as we saw previously

920
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:04,310
there is in fact only two of them that makes sense

921
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,330
my way of looking

922
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,770
so the the ones

923
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:10,090
which are

924
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:14,420
i have to rain first and then have the probability of having x then given

925
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,190
the range

926
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,760
and the probability of going to the movies

927
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,690
all that the property that may

928
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:23,860
neighbours is going to the to the movie given that there have been an accident

929
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,190
and that it is raining

930
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,180
which doesn't make a lot of sense

931
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:30,250
that it seems that two unconnected to

932
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,120
and so in fact

933
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,750
we don't want this link

934
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,560
so there's there's

935
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,320
another thing missing

936
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,580
which shows

937
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:44,940
kind of conditional independence

938
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,200
given the range

939
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:48,060
having an accident

940
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:51,430
and that my neighbours go to the to the movie

941
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,560
it's it's not connected

942
00:59:55,170 --> 01:00:00,400
this graph shows this independent

943
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,710
finished example

944
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:12,540
our defined directed graphical model is more in general

945
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:17,170
so i directed graphical mothers

946
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:21,740
which of course are composed of nodes

947
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,940
representing the random variables

948
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:26,580
and of directed links

949
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:32,200
representing the conditional distribution between the random variables

950
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:38,760
terminology if x is is the parent node of y

951
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:42,280
why is the child node of x you have this

952
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:46,460
this is graphical representation

953
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:50,350
we're not consider whatever graph

954
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:56,530
the graph that are using probabilistic graphical mother directed the grammars are direct that are

955
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,830
a directed acyclic graph

956
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:04,450
with that is that graph we have no directed cycles

957
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:05,870
so here

958
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:08,040
as you can see i can go from one

959
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,460
now to another

960
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:12,890
well tell me all about the easier

961
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,230
i mean the whole lot

962
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:18,020
what is the null space for this

963
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,730
it's all vectors of the form so what could what could be it could be

964
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,940
one one minus one

965
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,460
it could be

966
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,270
it could be

967
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:31,290
any numbers c

968
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:35,580
and number the same number again

969
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,670
in other words

970
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:43,580
any multiple of this guy

971
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:47,660
that that's a perfect description because

972
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:53,670
the zero vector automatically included because they would be zero

973
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:58,480
the vector i had is included because he be one but now any

974
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:04,460
and that's actually a

975
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,790
and what have you i was

976
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:09,770
and what does it look like

977
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,480
so what how would you describe the

978
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,980
knowledge space this

979
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,210
all these factors of the form c

980
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:22,390
the minus the like seven seven nine

981
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:27,460
minus eleven minus eleven plus eleven what have i got here

982
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:32,060
if it describes the whole knowledgebase on what if i drew it

983
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,120
what do i

984
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,580
a lot right

985
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,560
no spaces or line is the line through

986
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,100
it in our three

987
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:49,960
and the vector the long one negative one maybe goes down work goes down here

988
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,870
the vector

989
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:56,250
one one negative one if you gave me

990
01:02:56,310 --> 01:03:00,710
and where the vectors these the negative see it on the fly

991
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:03,460
of course there is zero zero zero that we had

992
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,080
and what we've got them all

993
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,870
the whole life

994
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,920
going both ways

995
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,290
really are

996
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:15,830
and all places line north korea

997
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,020
for example

998
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,870
find all the

999
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:30,230
combinations of the columns the behaviour of that size

1000
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,870
i just

1001
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:34,270
take one more

1002
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:38,540
go back to the definition of

1003
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:41,770
vector space

1004
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,120
and as you

1005
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:49,040
how do i know that the null space is about

1006
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:53,640
how and why entitled to use the word phrase never

1007
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:55,960
space without meaning

1008
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,420
two requirements are set

1009
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,870
can we just said that they are

1010
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,120
so i want to check that

1011
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,290
i continue here

1012
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:17,690
he was all

1013
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:26,480
a seven

1014
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,830
and the course the keyword

1015
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,310
what do i have to that

1016
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:41,230
i have to show that if i have one solution call

1017
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:43,620
another solution college

1018
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:48,750
that there's are some is also a

1019
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:52,620
that's required to use the word base

1020
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,900
i have to say i have convinced myself

1021
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:59,210
if they are zero

1022
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:04,670
a star

1023
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:08,870
zero or maybe i should have said if a b is zero

1024
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:10,960
and a w is zero

1025
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,810
then what about the place

1026
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:16,290
so i make use of

1027
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:18,830
if they really were

1028
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:22,920
and a w zero

1029
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:23,920
then what

1030
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:29,440
then what is the what if that and then what my

1031
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,620
o point here

1032
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,940
that a times

1033
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:35,100
plus w

1034
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,600
must be

1035
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:39,980
that's the

1036
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:40,960
but at the

1037
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:48,670
and w the null space then there from the plus w mills and of course

1038
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:55,420
now i've written down totally absurd ridiculously simple

1039
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,770
matrix multiplication allows me to separate the two

1040
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:05,690
eight people as they don't

1041
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:09,850
i should say for very simple that was the done thing to say we use

1042
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:14,160
a basic law of matrix multiplication

1043
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:17,160
actually we used without proving it

1044
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:20,290
that's OK we only along the

1045
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:26,730
i thing it's called the distributive law that i can

1046
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:27,660
let's please

1047
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:29,420
with this in the two pieces

1048
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,520
but but now you see the point

1049
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,870
the a b

1050
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:38,040
it is zero and a w zero so i have zero but there are get

1051
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,600
and similarly i have the

1052
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,750
to show that if a b is zero

1053
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:48,730
a kind

1054
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:50,420
any multiple say

1055
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,830
well the

1056
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:55,310
how do i know that

1057
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:57,020
because i'm allowed to

1058
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:01,390
bring that well that's a number a scalar control

1059
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,520
outside psi as well

1060
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,560
a b twelve heroes

1061
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,500
it's really critical to

1062
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,520
i understand the

1063
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:23,140
and what of my what i was going to understand what the point of vectors

1064
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,790
let me make the point

1065
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:28,830
changing the right hand side

1066
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:33,350
OK i mean change the right hand side one two three four

1067
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:39,600
and that's what's called the agency theory and that puts human beings or possibly robot

1068
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:42,710
at the centre of the stage

1069
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,120
causality there is about

1070
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,460
bringing things about

1071
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:49,530
it's about what you can do

1072
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:55,300
to bring about some desired and intervention agency getting in

1073
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,460
the fiddling with things giving them the kick

1074
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:00,320
and seeing what happens

1075
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:05,750
so causality is about response to what what happens when you kick something

1076
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:10,450
that actually solve a lot of problems to solve the the problem of which is

1077
01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:13,350
the cause of which is in effect

1078
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,580
if i could q when you scream

1079
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:19,320
i had the control over the k no direct control over the screen it is

1080
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:23,500
obvious the kick off the screen and and not vice versa so they may be

1081
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,740
constant conjunction but it makes an asymmetric different

1082
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:33,930
so we've got to work very much with that agency conception of causality

1083
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:41,400
and finally a very statistical point of view very important is that we usually interested

1084
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,250
in comparison

1085
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:47,990
not so much what will you do if i k cuba what difference does it

1086
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:50,200
make whether i q or not

1087
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,890
maybe if i don't kick you'll still screen

1088
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:56,580
so i got to know i'm going to make a comparison between two or more

1089
01:08:56,620 --> 01:09:03,640
different actions and interventions and the corresponding effects

1090
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,310
OK so let's

1091
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:07,570
think about

1092
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,500
a couple of

1093
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:11,710
queries which are least

1094
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:15,450
indirectly of an obviously cause in nature

1095
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:20,630
and so on the toy example is taking aspirin to cure had a so let's

1096
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:24,880
suppose that kill counters that they had a going away within thirty minutes just to

1097
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,840
be precise a binary event

1098
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:30,820
so here's question

1099
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,830
i got a splitting headache and if i take an aspirin half an hour ago

1100
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:36,590
we need to combine

1101
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:40,180
what is it that's what we have been caused my

1102
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:44,120
i had a to get the other side of that would say

1103
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:46,620
i had a headache half an hour ago

1104
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:49,110
i took some astronomical will

1105
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,180
is that because i took the aspirin

1106
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:55,940
now that is what i would call

1107
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:58,380
inference about

1108
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,540
the causes

1109
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:04,470
of effects effect has been observed the have had not got a headache it's good

1110
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:09,790
state gone away whatever something happened a little while ago i i keep the system

1111
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:12,310
in a particular way by taking aspirin or not

1112
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:18,580
and this was the recall the relationship i know i know what happened to the

1113
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:23,580
interesting thing in comparison with say a lot of things

1114
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:28,210
theory of probability and uncertainty everything is the what happened is not uncertain all i

1115
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:32,520
know what happened i know what the esperance of back to front but know to

1116
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:37,560
the astrodome it's gone away when i don't know is whether the connections causal and

1117
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:40,620
one way of phrasing that is what did have gone away

1118
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:44,610
if i'd done the other thing is the contrast

1119
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:45,790
now we have

1120
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:51,360
the question is that also sort looking backwards over the shoulder well into the past

1121
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:56,220
everything's been observed was the connection causal a different question is looking forward

1122
01:10:56,230 --> 01:11:00,470
i got a headache shall i should i take aspirin

1123
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:05,680
will my headache go away within half an hour and in order to decide that

1124
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:09,340
i should probably also think about what would happen if i don't take aspirin because

1125
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:12,280
it is going to go away when hafner anyway maybe you don't know what the

1126
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:18,930
so that is the question of the effects of causes

1127
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:22,530
now i personally think the best distinction is vital

1128
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:29,800
that these questions have somewhat different nature and they require somewhat different approaches

1129
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:33,430
they're both quite subtle and difficult to answer

1130
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:38,950
but causes of effects is at least twice the subtle and difficult once as effects

1131
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:41,070
of causes

1132
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:47,060
one of the reason for that is because causes of effects involves what you might

1133
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:52,920
call counterfactual reasoning in order to think about what my headache has have gone by

1134
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,720
now i've got to think about

1135
01:11:54,770 --> 01:12:00,190
a potential thing in the past which i actually know is false

1136
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:05,590
i didn't think the aspirin i'm conjecture in something which is counter to known facts

1137
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:09,770
cont counterfactual and yet i got to sort of take make some sort of logical

1138
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:14,120
sense of this and tell the story which makes sense going is kind of difficult

1139
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:19,240
to have a framework in which we can formulate a query clearly

1140
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:23,220
well on on the contrary what i call a hypothetical

1141
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,700
reasoning is what's required for thinking about effects of causes i don't ever have to

1142
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:33,310
think about anything which is counter to known facts here i am with my headache

1143
01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:38,660
i can hypothesize i'll take aspirin which is something perfectly open to me and consider

1144
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:40,840
what might be the consequence

1145
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,110
so i can hypothesize that i refrained from taking aspirin which again is an action

1146
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:51,020
open to me not contradict any facts and consider what might be the consequences i

1147
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:54,650
could do those two things make comparison is true i can't do both of them

1148
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:57,350
but i can only have to look think about one one

1149
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:01,740
not the other one then compare the in some sense the

1150
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:07,570
and that is my comparison so i'd like to make this distinction between

1151
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:14,220
counterfactual reasoning and hypothetical reasoning a distinction which i think is almost never made so

1152
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:18,320
i'm i'm i make a fuss about it hardly anybody does people tend to use

1153
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,970
the word counterfactual for all sorts of different meanings in particular for what i call

1154
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:28,790
hypothetical reasoning again i think just as it's worth making the distinction between inference about

1155
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:34,200
causes of effects and effects of causes the different kinds of questions so

1156
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:38,650
we have to distinguish between the different kinds of reasoning which going to the to

1157
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:46,330
the kind of

1158
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:51,710
causes of effects counterfactual reasoning which which is the context in which that occurs allied

1159
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,430
to this was this was the

1160
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:58,320
the main thrust not surprisingly the legal conference i went to reason they want to

1161
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:03,020
so that's the that's the importance of having allocation plans

1162
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:05,110
this decided upfront right i mean

1163
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:10,280
we nobody expects these plans to be satisfied exactly when you're doing online service that

1164
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,900
will be deviations from this plan

1165
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,320
but still this provides a rough guideline of how serving in real time

1166
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,590
and adhere to the

1167
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:22,400
overall business object

1168
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:26,070
you you can only decide optimality if you have an objective function so what's the

1169
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:32,090
the the part of the problem is coming up with the objective problem function rather

1170
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:35,600
than solving and selling it is all the cover coming over the objective function is

1171
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,980
more difficult so what could be the objective function here

1172
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:43,670
if you have more than one feasible solution what objective function should use

1173
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:48,250
to come up with an optimal allocation that's the next question

1174
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,690
so the optimality

1175
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:52,960
correct again would depend on the goal of the network

1176
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,860
OK so one thing

1177
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,900
which is

1178
01:14:57,940 --> 01:14:59,320
important to notice

1179
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:02,460
advertisers don't like to specify too many

1180
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:06,280
to find grained trade and if you do that you don't want to say oh

1181
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,480
i want to target males from fifty five who

1182
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:13,030
drink coffee in the morning and wandering off enough that's not that's not the sort

1183
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:17,230
of specifications jervis you expect from advertisers and the say OK i want so many

1184
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:20,980
impressions from yahoo sports and that's it i'm done i should get good order while

1185
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:26,210
the fall of former camp so secondly you know even if they do specify it's

1186
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:31,020
not good for the for because they have to really forecast inventory and those resolutions

1187
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:33,940
if you don't fall because there is no in the world can guarantee

1188
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,480
impressions in the future access

1189
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:44,460
the targeting is done that course levels that are done very fine resolutions

1190
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:47,150
so i'm not going to

1191
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:51,980
enumerate all the objective function or the optimality or objective function one could

1192
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:55,320
having this situation where i'm going to just give you some examples

1193
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:59,550
again i mean depending on the goal of that we give you an ad network

1194
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:02,980
you might have different objective function but i'm just going to give

1195
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:06,630
so first objective function which is very natural is

1196
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:08,610
can you do some cherry picking right

1197
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,980
so give the advertisers what they want

1198
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,860
so for instance if you do that it's OK one one million impressions and yahoo

1199
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:19,460
sports i'm going to make sure i give you the worst impressions on sport you

1200
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:23,190
not ask for good in britain is that i want one million impressions of sports

1201
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:27,360
and i know that all people visiting yahoo sports generally

1202
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,150
i don't convert as much

1203
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:33,010
as a young people so i'm going to see if they are the only or

1204
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:34,670
people because they not ask

1205
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:37,170
we do not specify young people

1206
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:41,590
so that's called cherry picking right but it's not

1207
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,940
if you start doing that you start hurting your guaranteed delivery process

1208
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,070
so that's idea that you thought okay well i'm going to buy guaranteed

1209
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:55,070
advertising and naive and to you know and as one million impressions all sports and

1210
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:58,320
you give you a crappy set of users

1211
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:03,700
of course if you look at the article i e o i could actually got

1212
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:07,210
to the sport marketing board better things than this and so you might want to

1213
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:10,090
come back and by getting to do so at the end of the day what

1214
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:14,360
has happened is the hard quality of premium problem

1215
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:19,300
so that's not a good idea doing cherry-picking is not always a good idea

1216
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:23,400
unless you have a very clear of future demand the

1217
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,840
that the team would be to spread the wealth

1218
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,690
right so anyone

1219
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:33,360
if you if anyone coming to sports asking for one million impressions used

1220
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:37,670
you know you proportionally allocate all kinds of inventory and yahoo sports to this is

1221
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:39,920
so you old people young people

1222
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:43,780
and i asked one million impression that eighty percent of people twenty percent young people

1223
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:46,530
i'm going to get eighty twenty location

1224
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:51,130
so that's kind of spreading the wealth around right end that that's actually better

1225
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:55,030
even if you don't even if you forgot to specify somebody find attribute is still

1226
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:57,630
guaranteed to get certain quality of just

1227
01:17:57,650 --> 01:18:02,360
by specifying that you want things in the support but that's called the fairness const

1228
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:06,360
i some of these papers were built recently there have been work done by by

1229
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:10,920
our colleagues at all these things people is not out yet but it will be

1230
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:22,550
these thing are reflected in the CPM price let i mean

1231
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:25,230
under CPM price

1232
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:29,730
i recognise the fact that not all eyeballs good right there are many toolbox visiting

1233
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:35,070
our site you know if for instance if you have a very good for detecting

1234
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:38,110
and if you start figuring reward very aggressively and

1235
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:43,000
you see people automatically go high road the market is just to these things

1236
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:46,630
so so at the end of the day and yes you buying in bulk buying

1237
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:51,110
ads you saying what impression what you're buying in bulk and the price the CPM

1238
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:55,280
price you pay is going to be reflective of the quality of inventory right so

1239
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:58,960
a lot of users and use ad blockers then

1240
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:03,800
in the CP will go down that doesn't immediately figure out there

1241
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:05,820
this traffic is not good

1242
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:08,780
so this implies that

1243
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:10,070
the first part

1244
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:14,860
i will not be affected so this only depends on the function

1245
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:18,470
through its values on the training points of the cost function only depends on the

1246
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:19,780
training points

1247
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:21,630
and therefore

1248
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:25,220
this is the value of this function c will not change

1249
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:26,770
no matter what

1250
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:32,650
part if the particular we have in particular if perpendicular with zero we would still

1251
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:36,120
get the same value here so this this is not affected the knowledge of the

1252
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:39,820
second second remember was this one here

1253
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,970
and i'm going to show you that the second term is actually minimized if f

1254
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:50,800
perpendicular is zero

1255
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:54,640
and that's actually straightforward so we just right on the second term

1256
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:57,550
again we substitute the expression of the function

1257
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:01,480
expansion on the training points plus a perpendicular

1258
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:05,970
i'm going to use the

1259
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:08,750
pythagorean theorem of possible

1260
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,940
the quality

1261
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:14,820
so i can since these two parts of i can write its length is the

1262
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:17,560
square root of the squares of the two

1263
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:20,560
individual links

1264
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:25,040
now the square root is a strictly monotonic function and also

1265
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:28,300
on the guys strictly monotonic function by assumption

1266
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:37,220
quantity here will be minimized if the second part is zero

1267
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:38,640
OK so if i in

1268
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:41,320
decrease this thing here which i can do i said in the second part is

1269
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:46,570
then the value of one thing i will decrease strictly and therefore

1270
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:50,750
the optimal value the one that will minimize this omega

1271
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:55,130
it will be the one with a perpendicular zero so the first object function in

1272
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:59,010
two parts the first part is not affected by a perpendicular to the second one

1273
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:04,080
is minimized by a perpendicular equal to zero therefore the overall solution has the property

1274
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,220
that particular is zero

1275
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,140
so therefore

1276
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:12,810
in this expansion here the second part of managers and the solution takes this form

1277
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:15,200
which is actually the statement of the theorem

1278
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:18,010
so the solution takes this form

1279
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:22,860
what can be written in this form

1280
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:25,560
so here's a little application

1281
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:32,730
if we use this cost function here we actually recover support vector classification

1282
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:37,730
so this is because function that depends on all the training points separately

1283
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:42,880
this looks a little bit funny here this term but all that does is that

1284
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,160
it it measures

1285
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:49,620
the slack variables if you want so this is this one ensures that you measure

1286
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:50,860
the slack variables

1287
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:56,620
already once point enters into the margin and then this quantity corresponds to the SEC

1288
01:21:57,930 --> 01:22:01,850
maybe it's not important that you understand the details you can think about it afterwards

1289
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:04,250
and quite communities nothing deep

1290
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:08,530
so this would be the cost function for support vector classification and as the regularizer

1291
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:14,300
we use this quantity here and then you get the soft margin support vector machines

1292
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,730
which is not surprising because we already so as a consequence of the the optimisation

1293
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:20,860
problem that indeed the

1294
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:23,220
solution to the problem is in act

1295
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:26,010
the expansion in terms of support vectors

1296
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:30,190
you can also give other examples

1297
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,630
maybe i don't go into detail on them

1298
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:34,740
you can

1299
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:38,200
actually these cost functions of this time

1300
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:43,580
you can also reinterpret in in the bayesian way

1301
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:49,420
by identifying this with the prior in identifying this term with the likelihood of the

1302
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:55,870
and i assume you will learn more about this ferences because chris bishop

1303
01:22:55,930 --> 01:23:02,170
and then maximizing minimizing this cost function corresponds to what's what's called finding the maximum

1304
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:03,240
a posteriori

1305
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:07,260
solution of the problem

1306
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:09,580
so let's go back here

1307
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:15,340
so we identify this with the likelihood of the data actually e to the polls

1308
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,570
this thing

1309
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:18,480
and this with the prior

1310
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:23,040
and then the minimizer of of function the the representer theorem talks about is the

1311
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:27,450
so-called maximum a posteriori estimate on MAP estimate

1312
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:32,180
another algorithm that's falls into this category of programs of the representer theorem talks about

1313
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:36,230
is called kernel PCA and i think i spend a little bit of time explaining

1314
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:37,090
it to you

1315
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:42,560
as an example of of some non support vector kernel algorithms and in this case

1316
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,880
we actually need a cost function that depends

1317
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:50,220
joint union all the data in this since it's

1318
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:57,090
each individual term here also has been effects from the other terms

1319
01:23:57,130 --> 01:24:00,040
so we've only done this one

1320
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,210
so now we can

1321
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:07,820
move on to further kernel algorithms

1322
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:16,120
so all the the kernel algorithms have follow some simple design principles they all have

1323
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:19,450
occurred and in addition some learning modules

1324
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:25,750
if you want to so far the learning model has been binary classification two classification

1325
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:27,540
but it could be

1326
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:32,850
a number of things could be for instance feature extraction and that's one thing that

1327
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:37,380
can PCA does not tell you about this just before i do this let me

1328
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:40,840
to summarise what we've learned about the kernel so far

1329
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:42,050
so the kernel

1330
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,990
we introduced some kind larity measure on the data

1331
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:52,840
then we prove that if this similarity measure satisfy certain conditions

1332
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:54,980
namely positive definiteness

1333
01:24:55,070 --> 01:25:00,300
then we can construct a feature space and a mapping into the feature space such

1334
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:03,610
that the kernel is the dot product in that space

1335
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:07,460
so in other words the kernel is not just a similarity measure it also induces

1336
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:11,930
a representation of the data in some dot product space

1337
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:16,100
independent of whether the data of vectors to begin with or not so the kernel

1338
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:20,590
also gives you data representation if you want and finally

1339
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:21,890
the kernel also

1340
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:27,080
in this sense parameterizes the function class of possible solutions to your problems so i

1341
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:27,840
told you that

1342
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,040
under this very general conditions that apply for all that kind of thing that we're

1343
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,010
talking about

1344
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:37,470
the solutions are expansions in terms of pounds sitting on the training points of the

1345
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:43,880
curve also characterizes the function class which is actually crucial in machine learning function classes

1346
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:48,250
you will find that john shawe taylor will be talking about function classes or concept

1347
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,380
classes a lot so

1348
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:56,960
you can think of these three years s three basic issues in machine learning and

1349
01:25:56,970 --> 01:25:59,070
some kernel elegantly

1350
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:02,640
o addresses all these three issues simultaneously

1351
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:06,720
so now let's look at different kernel algorithm which is not classification but for feature

1352
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,120
rather than just

1353
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:12,440
transporting means and variances as what we have for girls in random variable

1354
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:21,260
he was just distributing propagating statistics are fairly arbitrary distributions in sending that through

1355
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:27,070
it was a bit more complicated but the communications architecture is the same

1356
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,940
things get completely missing

1357
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:30,330
if you have loops

1358
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:31,510
if you have that

1359
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,690
this piece will be expensive to store

1360
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,870
that was the brief excursion

1361
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:44,240
now let's see how much we can get

1362
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,290
the last bit

1363
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:50,660
don't let you don't get fooled by the number of slides

1364
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:51,760
it replaced

1365
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:55,340
but actually there's a lot in

1366
01:26:55,350 --> 01:27:00,190
so will start the multiclass estimation

1367
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:02,920
and then depending on how things go

1368
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:05,440
well the max margin markov networks

1369
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:09,970
or we look at the page tracking

1370
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:13,780
here's trusted binary classification example

1371
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:16,810
separating surface from stars

1372
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:19,350
and that's the large margin solution

1373
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:22,120
somebody asked when the break well

1374
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,020
you can actually find this well

1375
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,660
freeze into the mentioned

1376
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:30,360
you just need to look for the points are on the boundaries

1377
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:32,580
and you know that well

1378
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:36,360
three points most will determine whether that separates allies

1379
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:41,280
and out of which two points along one line another one will be on the

1380
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,330
other side

1381
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:46,430
so that's reasonably easy to do

1382
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:49,850
you might have more points sitting there as a professor place of the point there

1383
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:54,530
but it wouldn't really change things

1384
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:59,490
the just rewrite things

1385
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:03,610
and this is exactly why is it before some notation can be a blessing and

1386
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:07,260
sometimes you can really delay progress

1387
01:28:09,010 --> 01:28:10,660
so what we have

1388
01:28:11,890 --> 01:28:15,010
find classification issues

1389
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:20,170
well i got excited when wireless and i define the following marginal

1390
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:23,680
are required for i've been one

1391
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:25,110
excited w

1392
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,990
as we grow to equal than one

1393
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,360
x i n minus the

1394
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:33,850
so i've done exactly matches taking original martin scale

1395
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:35,320
by factor of two

1396
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:38,060
now drop the constant offset just because of the

1397
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,340
annoying to deal with

1398
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,400
at the moment

1399
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:46,210
and for wiping minus one i can do the same thing

1400
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:50,310
now what has happened and basically saying

1401
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:53,740
the large four x

1402
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:57,660
and w which corresponds to class one

1403
01:28:57,670 --> 01:28:59,670
that quantity has to be larger

1404
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:00,730
then one

1405
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:03,020
in approach between ics

1406
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:05,080
and the corresponding to class

1407
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:07,600
minus one

1408
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,190
from one class is one of the same thing

1409
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:14,360
the margin forex in the class minus is one of the great within one class

1410
01:29:16,030 --> 01:29:18,070
w four class one

1411
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,550
some of these are

1412
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,370
let me write about the overall

1413
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:25,200
i could an approach between i and WY

1414
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:27,100
has to be greater recall than one

1415
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:31,790
last in the property i w one prime worldwide prime

1416
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:35,200
equal to y

1417
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:39,560
so what i'm basically saying is

1418
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:41,910
i want to make sure

1419
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:45,470
for the correct class

1420
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:47,640
i am at least

1421
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:49,830
why one more confident

1422
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:51,360
of thinking that one

1423
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:53,710
then for all the old correct classes

1424
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,160
and then i could just do inference

1425
01:29:56,240 --> 01:30:02,740
by taking the y for which w exi is largest

1426
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:10,830
the question is this is actually conceptually fairly tricky step

1427
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,090
good so

1428
01:30:14,170 --> 01:30:16,690
what i'm doing is i'm requiring

1429
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:19,900
the value of w and x

1430
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:22,190
for the correct class label

1431
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:26,280
at least by one exceeds the inner product between w and x for the incorrect

1432
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,100
class labels

1433
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:30,910
fact in class that got in w

1434
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:32,060
now want to ensure

1435
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:34,290
for those other nine values

1436
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:40,600
then product with x is smaller than for the correct guy

1437
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:45,140
and he everybody classification access define w one three w

1438
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:49,450
w minus one to be minus w

1439
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,700
seven look at pictures

1440
01:30:54,710 --> 01:31:00,010
these three classes this trying to break

1441
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:03,290
these will be some normal vectors

1442
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:05,550
this these are the hyperplanes

1443
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,290
anything in this

1444
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:08,820
region here would be

1445
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:12,920
class blue there will be class this would be class green

1446
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:17,030
to make my life little bit easier after just constraints make those three to be

1447
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:21,010
of the same length but in practice of course they wouldn't

1448
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:24,690
and sorry

1449
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:28,300
now what will actually to do is we need to define margins here will do

1450
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:31,210
that in

1451
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:35,870
so let's look at the general theory

1452
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:40,710
rather than carrying the w around for all possible labels i'm just pushing all of

1453
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:43,740
that into five x and y

1454
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:45,640
i can do this by

1455
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:47,930
it's a instance i have ten classes

1456
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:50,730
for x and y will be just the vector of

1457
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:53,190
all zeros except for that row

1458
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:59,950
is relevant then it would be for fixed otherwise serious offenses for fixed in one

1459
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:02,900
week before fixed then all sierra

1460
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,300
five weeks into

1461
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:05,950
it would be zero

1462
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:10,760
then for fixed and then all zeros and so on

1463
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:16,130
OK i'll right after the like four

1464
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:19,390
but the key trick is this can be anything

1465
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:24,650
i mean OK that sounds pretty stupid now what

1466
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:28,600
in fact this is what people have been exploiting over the past couple of years

1467
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:30,320
and pretty much free choice

1468
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:34,510
of all x in y where people could solve it they've written several papers on

1469
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:38,250
that idea

1470
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:39,160
that's the

1471
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:44,850
that's the mechanical analog the delta e reaction this is the driving force for the

1472
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:46,730
reaction in the first place

1473
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:51,630
the driving force for the reaction and EA in fact is the gatekeeper

1474
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:55,600
it's the gatekeeper it determines the rate of reaction

1475
01:32:55,620 --> 01:33:00,470
because on the basis of e a e eight mediates

1476
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:04,230
the rate constant so all other things being equal temperature

1477
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:08,800
it gives you the rate constant through EA

1478
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,090
and i will recall the other

1479
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:14,930
temperature effect you say what she has done is any of this stuff happen if

1480
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:19,910
if room temperature you know the room temperature energy is typically on the order of

1481
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:25,290
about forty thousand electron volts i just told you that chemical reactions have an activation

1482
01:33:25,290 --> 01:33:29,280
energies on the order of one electron volt according that we have to be up

1483
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:33,330
to thousands of degrees centigrade in order to to promote any chemical reactions how do

1484
01:33:33,330 --> 01:33:37,420
we get chemical reactions at two hundred three hundred degrees centigrade

1485
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:40,020
what we have going on here is

1486
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:42,270
the distribution of energy

1487
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:44,080
the distribution of energies

1488
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:47,100
and i will go back to that plot that we saw earlier here's

1489
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:48,310
t one

1490
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:50,590
here's the average energy

1491
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:52,820
at t one

1492
01:33:52,850 --> 01:33:58,860
and over here is one electron volt or whatever happens to be the activation energy

1493
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:04,240
and so only the fraction of the population that has greater than the activation energy

1494
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:08,750
is able to participate in the reaction and we've seen before the measure of the

1495
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:12,980
area under the curve from EA o to infinity is given by

1496
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:16,030
the relationship EA

1497
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:19,020
cables t

1498
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:21,040
exponential of

1499
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:23,060
and so

1500
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:25,660
it was boltzmann who first gave us this

1501
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:31,240
understanding and maxwell gave us the distribution and a way we go so what happens

1502
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:35,270
by changing temperature we've seen before we change temperature

1503
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:38,220
the curve moves ever so slightly so that the

1504
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:42,410
the average energy at t two

1505
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:47,060
forty two is greater than t one the average energy moves the little bit but

1506
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:52,870
what happens up here is the area under the curve between EA infinity goes up

1507
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:57,120
large leaps and bounds and that's how i

1508
01:34:57,190 --> 01:35:03,350
modest increases in temperature were able to get substantial increases in the rate of reaction

1509
01:35:03,450 --> 01:35:05,900
so now let's look at some specific

1510
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:11,400
reactions of various common or someone look at first order which is the commonest unlike

1511
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:15,280
its second order so let's look at first order reactions

1512
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:18,490
first order reaction

1513
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:22,680
so here's an example example is

1514
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:25,970
in two o five decomposes to give us

1515
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:28,060
and all two

1516
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:32,480
o two so there's the stoichiometry of the reaction

1517
01:35:32,530 --> 01:35:34,640
but on the basis of

1518
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:36,360
on the basis of

1519
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:41,300
measurements in the laboratory we can write that the rate of consumption

1520
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:43,290
in two o five

1521
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:46,850
so this is the square brackets denote concentration

1522
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:49,370
it's going to to be linear

1523
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:54,850
in concentration of two o five or into two o five race the the first

1524
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:58,710
power so this we say is a first order reaction and i'm getting tired of

1525
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:03,830
writing into all five bracket bracket so i'm just going to write c

1526
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:09,800
c represents all of this and compressing the summary rewrite this equation minus described by

1527
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,660
the team

1528
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:16,420
he calls casey so that's a first order reaction why because this is the one

1529
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:17,980
that's why it's first order

1530
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:23,480
it's linearly dependent the rate of change of c is linearly dependent on concentration so

1531
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:27,330
i do a little bit calculus here if i i can invert this and i

1532
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:29,050
can then right

1533
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:34,450
minus the c oversee equals k

1534
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,680
the two

1535
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:38,610
and we're going to do is integrate this thing out so that we can get

1536
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:40,140
the timeline on this

1537
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:41,220
and so

1538
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:45,970
i can put an integration sign here k is independent so can do that

1539
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:50,510
and i'm going to start at time zero or have some initial concentration and go

1540
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:54,820
to some arbitrary concentration see an arbitrary time t

1541
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:58,490
so what i want to look at is this if i plot this is some

1542
01:36:58,490 --> 01:37:02,290
initial concentration versus time

1543
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:03,330
we know

1544
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:05,750
all of these things are going to attenuate i want to know

1545
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:08,100
what this curve really really looks like

1546
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:11,540
and i know some of you are saying or wincing secular your math professors have

1547
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:15,990
told you can make the limits of an mineral the same as the value of

1548
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:19,260
the integrand so i don't want to go to mass jail also put little tilde

1549
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:23,680
is over this sort all the math we happy here is right but you know

1550
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:28,280
what you could do what i could do to really make it pedantic is let's

1551
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:33,750
not do that let's let's use the carrier variable so i'll make this as

1552
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:37,560
which now you don't know what i'm talking about i'll make this c

1553
01:37:37,570 --> 01:37:42,550
and that's mathematically beautiful it doesn't explain what we're talking about so i'm going to

1554
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:44,820
go back and put to sea

1555
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:46,590
little tilde over it

1556
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:49,380
so everybody now is happy

1557
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:51,330
so there we go this is t

1558
01:37:51,330 --> 01:37:55,970
kind of parametric or global model fuzzy effects and then gone after estimating the parameters

1559
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,390
here not that's not what we're doing we're estimating values of c one point in

1560
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:04,310
OK so once again you have this data

1561
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:09,060
and one very simple way to estimate the value of the scalar remember remember this

1562
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:10,900
is just the scale of pixel value

1563
01:38:10,910 --> 01:38:14,320
it is to do a very elementary least squares

1564
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:18,540
OK so if i just write this least squares cost function and minimize it over

1565
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:21,180
the scalar psi xj

1566
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:25,390
then the solution would just be the average of of the pixel values that give

1567
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:27,680
rise to this not very excited

1568
01:38:28,330 --> 01:38:31,580
going one step further from this you might say well

1569
01:38:31,690 --> 01:38:36,470
this formulation actually gives equal weight to all the data

1570
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:39,380
so if you solve this you just get the average so the weight in front

1571
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:41,820
of each of the data points is one of ran

1572
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:44,710
so why not give different weights to data

1573
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,700
so that gives rise to

1574
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:48,950
a weight function k

1575
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:50,570
this is what we call the kernel

1576
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:56,000
and and this way function is not going to make this weighted least squares problems

1577
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:58,450
not terribly more complicated than before

1578
01:38:58,470 --> 01:39:02,950
the only difference is that this weight function is now somehow going to measure similarity

1579
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:05,660
between the data points

1580
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:09,790
which you have and the data points around it

1581
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:14,270
and in some sense penalizes things that are not similar enough

1582
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:16,730
to this location hand

1583
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:19,850
OK now the way this particular function

1584
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:24,690
is measured is going to give you a cacophony of different types of algorithms many

1585
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:25,730
of which will be

1586
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:27,790
immediately familiar

1587
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:28,690
OK so

1588
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:32,620
the bottom line here is is very simple is just the weighted least squares formulation

1589
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:35,590
but it leads to a lot of interesting insights

1590
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:36,660
right so let me go

1591
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:38,220
so the next step

1592
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:42,260
so that's right away to discourse problem in this

1593
01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:45,390
vector notation so i'm going to stack all the data

1594
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:47,950
y one through y and this vector y

1595
01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:52,310
i'm going define this vector ones once and and then

1596
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:55,450
the values of this kernel function

1597
01:39:55,500 --> 01:40:00,280
we are going to be stacked into the diagonal of this diagonal matrix kj

1598
01:40:00,290 --> 01:40:02,820
so i can write the quadratic cost function

1599
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:04,810
to minimize

1600
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:07,340
and when i do this simple

1601
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:09,580
minimisation what i get

1602
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,700
is the value of the pixel

1603
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:12,890
and xj

1604
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:15,700
it is just this expression on the right hand side

1605
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:20,950
OK in writing it sort of in longhand what you have is some

1606
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,710
of a bunch of coefficients times the data points

1607
01:40:24,730 --> 01:40:28,620
OK now what's interesting here is that if you look at these data points if

1608
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:31,500
you look at these cost so if you look at these weights

1609
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:34,820
the weights are normalized

1610
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:39,270
so the sum up to one there are also positive

1611
01:40:39,310 --> 01:40:43,040
OK and here the way i've written in the weights are a function of the

1612
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:46,880
positions and also the actual grey values at those positions

1613
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:48,540
OK so this fairly general

1614
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,320
the bottom line here is that

1615
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:53,640
the solution to this optimisation problem

1616
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:57,400
is a convex combination of all the data that you consider

1617
01:40:57,430 --> 01:41:02,430
convex because these weights are positive and they also sum up to one

1618
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:08,600
so this is basically an optimisation problem we solve for estimating every pixel value that

1619
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:11,220
we're interested and we sort remove this

1620
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:15,660
optimisation problem around in fact this is exactly what the way what the

1621
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:20,180
moving least squares idea in in graphics as well this just weighted least squares and

1622
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,640
move around the image

1623
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:23,640
and you get a chance

1624
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:27,580
OK so i'm just going to write this as a vector vector

1625
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:31,200
inner product with this w contains these weights

1626
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:34,540
and the y again contains all the

1627
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:40,320
all right so now let's see what happens if we make different choices for this

1628
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,030
for this kernel function

1629
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:45,770
OK so here's the simplest case if you take this kernel function to be simple

1630
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:53,530
with the exponent being the spatial distance sort of the euclidean distance between the two

1631
01:41:53,530 --> 01:41:56,170
spatial positions with these two samples are

1632
01:41:56,190 --> 01:41:59,120
if you want to measure the similarity between these two and you use this metric

1633
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:00,510
then all using

1634
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:05,220
is the the the the euclidean distance what you get is

1635
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:08,550
the classical gas in linear filters

1636
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:15,000
we all know from basic sort of signals and systems signal processing

1637
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:18,630
OK now i should also say that these filters

1638
01:42:18,650 --> 01:42:22,220
even though they are linear could be spatially varying

1639
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:28,570
so depending on how your data sample if data sampled regularly then that's fine but

1640
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:31,550
the properties that the not very much

1641
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,760
it was turning what should be done

1642
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,730
this approach

1643
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:39,940
words eventually learning its maximum expected utility

1644
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:44,230
ninety involved many many cycles of learning

1645
01:42:44,270 --> 01:42:47,800
in fact typically people report the you know they got a paper cut in the

1646
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:49,600
paper the reporter agent

1647
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:52,110
and then use reinforcement learning to learn some task

1648
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:56,900
after ten thousand cycles

1649
01:42:56,950 --> 01:42:58,040
well i mean

1650
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:01,770
you have to have some way of automating that you can imagine having it

1651
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:04,530
and artificial human with ten thousand cycles

1652
01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:06,930
incredibly be painful to get the rewards

1653
01:43:06,990 --> 01:43:11,090
so the down the downside of reinforcement learning is typically made two

1654
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:14,180
i do a lot of

1655
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:18,880
a lot of cycles in order to learn

1656
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:27,720
well the

1657
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:32,900
roughly speaking the is deployed in the environment

1658
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:34,630
and the rewards discount

1659
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:37,230
so well there's different kinds of cases

1660
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:39,800
they can be the case where

1661
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:43,310
there's no real into the task and it just goes on forever

1662
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:47,230
probably more typical has learned play something like chess

1663
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:51,730
the last thing louis loses especially minus one

1664
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:54,650
and then you officially moved back to the initial state

1665
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:59,640
so there's an action which forced to beg initial states of consensually considers only continuing

1666
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:02,190
but actually is in this sense kind prosodic

1667
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:05,290
because it goes back to the beginning and in the plane every again

1668
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:07,340
so the two typical things happen

1669
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:11,610
but the downside is used in a lot of money

1670
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:13,930
in order to work

1671
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:50,370
well this is this this is not completely unrelated to the problem of exploitation explore

1672
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:52,450
exploration was referring to earlier

1673
01:44:52,530 --> 01:44:55,590
and the problem is that even if you make typically in them again the point

1674
01:44:55,590 --> 01:44:57,990
five gamma point nine

1675
01:44:58,010 --> 01:44:59,160
is the typical number

1676
01:44:59,190 --> 01:45:00,560
coming out the sea

1677
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:04,540
o ninety four nine five ninety point nine nine but actually when it's quite small

1678
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:06,190
liquid water

1679
01:45:06,190 --> 01:45:10,780
so it actually effectively has a fairly short horizon

1680
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:15,240
the other thing is to not bother about and just to show is of finite

1681
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:18,600
the possibly longer rising into the features

1682
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:40,190
the reward

1683
01:45:47,870 --> 01:45:51,970
so as it was the first what you get

1684
01:45:52,740 --> 01:46:12,890
yes are you oxygen this is starting from zero

1685
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,080
but in general

1686
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:16,770
now have been in general you're not here today

1687
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:21,470
and you're going to die t plus one is right

1688
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:33,430
and this company

1689
01:46:33,430 --> 01:46:35,640
we're doing right

1690
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:38,830
so there's a couple of

1691
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:44,260
there's a couple of summaries like that there's much point spending time on

1692
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:48,300
so let's just summarised

1693
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:52,210
the first of one is that actually offences

1694
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:56,570
a rational agent maximizes maximal performance to the

1695
01:46:56,630 --> 01:47:03,180
different kinds of environments

1696
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:04,940
the importance of

1697
01:47:04,990 --> 01:47:07,460
the importance of learning in my view it's the

1698
01:47:07,470 --> 01:47:12,960
this the key component machine learning is the key technology

1699
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:14,360
right OK

1700
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:17,380
i guess some of you will

1701
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:21,270
well study i starting

1702
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:31,030
a few words about

1703
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:34,230
how to understand the feelings whole

1704
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:36,270
so what's happened and i i

1705
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,220
is that

1706
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:42,100
is diversified into a number of substantial subfields

1707
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:44,000
ninety seven right

1708
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:45,730
machine learning

1709
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,080
automated reasoning

1710
01:47:48,370 --> 01:47:50,040
natural language processing

1711
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,050
roger station reasoning is about i

1712
01:47:57,470 --> 01:48:01,740
and they to these communities

1713
01:48:02,650 --> 01:48:05,650
to some extent in fact sometimes july sixteen

1714
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:08,390
divorced from the others for example robotics

1715
01:48:08,410 --> 01:48:10,110
doesn't have much connection

1716
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:12,690
rest of a i

1717
01:48:12,730 --> 01:48:16,710
and you can see other examples of that

1718
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:21,720
i'm gonna gonna go through for this true in the first few minutes

1719
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:24,140
maybe even after that

1720
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:26,900
so having started from the idea of

1721
01:48:26,950 --> 01:48:29,150
how do you build intelligent machines

1722
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:31,220
as the decades gone by

1723
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:33,910
i i was expanded and diversified

1724
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:35,870
and formed these

1725
01:48:35,930 --> 01:48:38,220
largely autonomous subfields

1726
01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:41,750
i can i mean the machine does not care about anybody else

1727
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:43,750
i get the feeling that just do it

1728
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:45,930
in fact believe i i

1729
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:47,870
many machine guns one billion

1730
01:48:48,090 --> 01:48:54,600
i said well this traffic opinion that i almost by definition there anyway

1731
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:57,730
so these fields subfields developed

1732
01:48:57,770 --> 01:49:01,200
but what's really nice about this a idea

1733
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:03,660
is it provides the framework

1734
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:07,130
by which you can bring it all back together

1735
01:49:07,190 --> 01:49:09,040
so the asian paradigm

1736
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:12,030
in IR is actually fairly recent

1737
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:15,660
it's really only from the nineteen nineties

1738
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:18,270
if you look at textbooks before that

1739
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:21,980
they typically had chapters on the various subtopics

1740
01:49:22,030 --> 01:49:26,440
and then put together very well the by what about building intelligent systems and again

1741
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:27,930
the planning

1742
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:30,080
it's improving whatever else

1743
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:32,390
one of the nice things and this is

1744
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:35,730
exemplified by russell and norvig

1745
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:40,360
they hang whole thing around the asian concept

1746
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:41,300
so the

1747
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:43,640
the concepts

1748
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:48,310
is the basic paradigm of artificial intelligence you are trying to build intelligent agents

1749
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:50,970
in order to do that we need some technology

1750
01:49:51,010 --> 01:49:55,560
but the technology come from comes from the subfields

1751
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:58,640
but what you really want do was integrated

1752
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:02,580
if you it's really into building intelligent systems

1753
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:05,510
so one of the technical challenges is to take this

1754
01:50:05,530 --> 01:50:07,560
really nice paradigm of

1755
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:11,010
the idea is empowered

1756
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:13,060
and from the various subfields

1757
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:18,470
pull the appropriate parts necessary and integrated nice way

1758
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:19,510
so if you

1759
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:21,760
studying artificial intelligence

1760
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,260
and what

1761
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:26,160
russell norvig subunit to make this page

1762
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:29,660
but try not get trapped in one of the sub fields

1763
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:30,660
think about the

1764
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:32,180
the original question

1765
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:33,870
the original question is

1766
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:36,310
how do you build intelligent machines

1767
01:50:36,330 --> 01:50:43,140
this woman trying to sell

1768
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:50,060
right so

1769
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:55,310
the rationality idea was one attempt to try and circumvent that

1770
01:50:55,390 --> 01:50:58,280
so in a sense the given the mathematical definition

1771
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:02,200
but intuitively we have something different in mind

1772
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:05,490
i think it should have the most people and i i

1773
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:07,600
even if they're not prepared to admit

1774
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:09,120
we'll be trying to build

1775
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:13,030
machines with human level intelligence

1776
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:15,680
OK and particularly

1777
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:22,200
bill machines that can go from one environment to another in and work well

1778
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:24,660
so the the characteristic

1779
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:26,490
humans have

1780
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:31,240
is the ability to go from to operate in many different domains

1781
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:33,370
and and be able to act

1782
01:51:33,830 --> 01:51:37,970
pretty well in almost any those domains

1783
01:51:38,010 --> 01:51:41,330
the ability be able had act different domains

1784
01:51:41,370 --> 01:51:45,120
you can't count the character characteristic of current IR systems

1785
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:46,740
is really strange

1786
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:52,030
you ask people

1787
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:55,130
what's your favourite activity

1788
01:51:55,170 --> 01:51:57,430
and if you ask people particularly

1789
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,340
college students

1790
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:02,390
critically this fresh from spring break

1791
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:07,190
i've seen the movie

1792
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:10,070
of an answer sex or some

1793
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:13,080
word that is synonymous with sex

1794
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:19,300
but there's a kind of puzzle

1795
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:23,300
about how much time we spend on sex and it turns out there is data

1796
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,860
on this

1797
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:27,680
so people say sectors are favoured activity

1798
01:52:27,690 --> 01:52:29,830
but it turns out we actually know

1799
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:33,330
how much time the average american spends on sex

1800
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:38,300
the data miner follow from was summarized by this what in this wonderful book by

1801
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:39,540
james quite

1802
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:46,450
the americans tell pollsters single favourite activity is sex

1803
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:52,700
in terms of enjoy ability they rank secs ahead of sports fishing bar-hopping hugging and

1804
01:52:53,570 --> 01:53:00,000
talking with the family eating and watching television going on trips planning trips gardening

1805
01:53:00,020 --> 01:53:06,640
bathing shopping dressing housework dishwashing laundry visited and doesn't get in the car repair

1806
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:08,460
on the other hand

1807
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:14,390
these same studies suggested the average time per day devoted to sex is four minutes

1808
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:17,320
and three seconds

1809
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:21,750
as quite says this is not much

1810
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:28,610
even after the four minutes this excludes time spent flirting and dancing going

1811
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:30,240
cruising the boulevard

1812
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:36,050
toning up in james toning up and beauty parlours rehearsing pick-up lines showering thinking about

1813
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:41,790
sex reading about sex doodling pornographic ways

1814
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:44,240
looking at erotic magazines

1815
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:49,870
renting video streaming of sex looking at fashion magazines cleaning up after sex coping with

1816
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:59,830
the consequences of sex buildings powers or otherwise repressing transferring and sublimated

1817
01:54:01,230 --> 01:54:05,800
i like this passage because it illustrates two points two important points one is we

1818
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:09,760
don't actually spend that much time on sex in fact the four minutes and three

1819
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:15,080
seconds an interesting number because when you when you do time studies on how much

1820
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:18,840
americans spent filling out tax-related forms

1821
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:23,980
three IRS it's four minutes in a few seconds

1822
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:29,160
the package also points out that regardless of the brutal time we spend on it

1823
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:34,230
extraordinarily important on everything in life follows from

1824
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:36,960
marriage family and children

1825
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:40,340
much of aggression much of competition

1826
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:45,920
much of art music and creative pursuits much in everything follows from it

1827
01:54:45,930 --> 01:54:48,220
if we were creature without sex

1828
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:50,350
everything will be different and

1829
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:52,010
what's interesting is

1830
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:54,200
there are creatures without sex

1831
01:54:54,290 --> 01:54:57,310
there are creatures that reproduce by cloning

1832
01:54:57,320 --> 01:55:02,610
and in fact this basic fact about people that we fall roughly into males and

1833
01:55:02,610 --> 01:55:05,870
females is the evolutionary mystery

1834
01:55:05,910 --> 01:55:11,830
it's not clear why animals that are somewhat large have two sexes

1835
01:55:11,850 --> 01:55:16,750
from a biological darwinian perspective having two sexes is bizarre

1836
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:20,450
because each time you have an offspring toss away half happy games

1837
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,920
my children only at each have have

1838
01:55:22,930 --> 01:55:24,140
my DNA

1839
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:27,220
if i was to close they would have all of that

1840
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:31,050
and so the puzzle has that ever evolved

1841
01:55:31,070 --> 01:55:34,780
this is not a course in evolutionary biology and that's not the puzzle will be

1842
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:35,910
looking at the data

1843
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:37,060
well that

1844
01:55:37,110 --> 01:55:39,160
a few questions

1845
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:44,630
first talk from first theoretical point of view and an empirical point of view about

1846
01:55:45,470 --> 01:55:47,650
males and females are different

1847
01:55:47,670 --> 01:55:50,390
then we talk about sexual attractiveness

1848
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:55,250
some research about what people find to be sexually attractive and also very little bit

1849
01:55:56,260 --> 01:56:01,850
about the origins of sexual preference why some people are straight others get others bisexual

1850
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:03,950
and others harder to classify

1851
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:06,890
now it

1852
01:56:06,940 --> 01:56:11,460
of all the topics i'm presenting sex is one of the sort of dicey ones

1853
01:56:11,470 --> 01:56:14,020
from an emotional point of view

1854
01:56:14,030 --> 01:56:16,010
these are difficult issues

1855
01:56:16,030 --> 01:56:17,750
because sex is

1856
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:22,160
or by definition an intimate part of our lives

1857
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,660
and it matters a lot

1858
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:28,800
moreover sex is fraught with moral implications

1859
01:56:28,810 --> 01:56:31,100
and since i'm talking about this from

1860
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:35,000
at least at the beginning from a darwinian evolutionary perspective

1861
01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:40,340
i'm obliged to start out by dealing with some of the moral consequences and moral

1862
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:43,580
implications so for instance

1863
01:56:44,770 --> 01:56:48,500
biologists all biologists i would say well argued

1864
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:50,330
that that

1865
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:53,860
sexual behavior sexual action sexual desire

1866
01:56:53,890 --> 01:56:58,960
is to some extent the biological adaptation existing to spread our genes from that perspective

1867
01:56:58,970 --> 01:57:01,960
than non procreative sex

1868
01:57:03,710 --> 01:57:06,380
gay sex sex with birth control

1869
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:09,230
six by postmenopausal women

1870
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,560
there's not much

1871
01:57:11,570 --> 01:57:16,690
sir this reproductive gold and in some sense perhaps is unnatural

1872
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:20,890
and one might argue that this mean is wrong

1873
01:57:20,950 --> 01:57:23,650
will also be talking about sex differences

1874
01:57:23,710 --> 01:57:28,990
the differences between men and women for instance in and how much you want anonymous

1875
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:34,190
sexual encounters differences between men and women in social intelligence

1876
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:36,060
in aggression empathy

1877
01:57:36,950 --> 01:57:39,720
regardless of what you think about these

1878
01:57:42,370 --> 01:57:45,380
well i you think the right or wrong or doesn't matter

1879
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:49,820
the last to question to what extent are immutable that is if there exists through

1880
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:54,280
darwinian natural selection to what extent

1881
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:56,690
can we ever get rid of

1882
01:57:56,710 --> 01:58:01,320
and i want to address those two issues issues of morality and inevitability

1883
01:58:01,330 --> 01:58:05,710
from the very start and i want to start off with

1884
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:10,600
with for each of them have a quote by prominent evolutionary scholars to the first

1885
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:15,690
one is by steven pinker in how the mind works

1886
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:16,970
he writes

1887
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:20,830
nature does not dictate what we should accept how we should live our lives well

1888
01:58:20,830 --> 01:58:27,460
into micro procreating years i am so far voluntarily childless having squandered my biological resources

1889
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:32,620
reading and writing doing research helping friends and students and jogging in circles ignoring the

1890
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:35,210
solemn imperative to spread my genes

1891
01:58:35,220 --> 01:58:40,230
by darwinian standards i'm a horrible mistake a pathetic loser

1892
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:42,890
but i'm happy to be that way in my teams don't like it they can

1893
01:58:42,890 --> 01:58:46,440
go jump in the lake

1894
01:58:46,490 --> 01:58:49,250
i think point i think is a reasonable one

1895
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:51,220
it is true

1896
01:58:51,230 --> 01:58:52,910
that certain things we do

1897
01:58:52,930 --> 01:58:58,190
exists to serve the dictate of natural selection but that doesn't make them right if

1898
01:58:58,190 --> 01:59:00,890
you think that something is only right

1899
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:04,010
it leads to the generation of more genes

1900
01:59:04,030 --> 01:59:07,280
if it leads to reproduction and you're not going to think very much about birth

1901
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:12,320
you're not going to think very much about any sort of non procreative sex on

1902
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:15,950
the other hand if you're more if you think something is wrong

1903
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:20,710
if it's the it's unnatural you know anything much about flying and apply

1904
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:22,530
a refrigerated food

1905
01:59:22,550 --> 01:59:25,400
or surviving severe infections

1906
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:31,090
more generally our bodies and brains have evolved reproductive success but we can use these

1907
01:59:31,090 --> 01:59:33,240
brains issues around destinies

1908
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:38,770
nothing more necessarily follows from the fact biology
