1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,930
situation where your algorithm

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,730
you know it

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,020
you don't really need to clustering it's OK to have three

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,600
then will be able to say a lot more about that

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,710
OK so this is natural because

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,190
melodic itself if you want to cluster search results so you do have very good

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,170
about advantage mccluster very naturally cluster them by tree and then you can click you

8
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,130
know you can see our because support versus science science this victory is click on

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,370
elsewhere in the math and physics OK of course you they click on it and

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,120
then let the user decide you know how they click so they want to have

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,190
specific to

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,840
and then another and so not required clustering of figure

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,690
so the claim is if we allow the clustering outcome this little bit more flexibility

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,240
then will be able to say more

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,190
properties that we can use

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,360
but in the end you you could go all the way down to

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,260
document so

18
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,900
but still that doesn't make it trivial problem because

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,680
you still need to be and someone thinking it should be afraid to find if

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,770
i was thinking of

21
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:21,690
basketball physics is one topic baseball union methods that topic that's not printing industry

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,320
OK because

23
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,360
we're five you know

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,270
maybe to be a little more

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,900
suppose i think baseball one topic everything else in the world is another topic

26
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,090
there are people like that

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,780
that's also another printing industry

28
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,990
it's not

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,190
baseball america also so printing is is setting some of these points to the we

30
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,370
i said this to believe that after that the

31
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,280
so this would be that would not be consistent with this property in fact if

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,740
you think about baseball for everything else

33
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:11,410
then the problem is this basketball things are not actually more similar

34
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:18,140
everything overall topic and everything because it was based on

35
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,650
so so the claim is actually if we relax gold this way we can start

36
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,220
to china

37
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,480
person thinks of as

38
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,910
as theoretician so that that's the the

39
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,710
my mind trying to say if you would like to know what proper fish we

40
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:39,490
can get into trouble if we require our actually output clustering was approximately correct but

41
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,780
if we allowed happen we can say all the more so for example

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,870
this property turns out to be sufficient and actually this property only is sufficient but

43
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:56,280
sufficient to cluster with extremely simple out across schools algorithm or single linkage basically the

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,710
algorithm is you take the two points are most similar you join them so in

45
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,320
general you've got some collection of clusters

46
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:09,190
and the point time find the pair of documents that are most similar but are

47
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,140
in different clusters and merge the two clusters

48
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,080
OK so this is the same as cross schools

49
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,920
minimum spanning tree algorithm except for using most similar instead of police this

50
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:27,770
merge and claim if you do this then this will in fact find the right

51
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,720
answer and

52
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,230
just because you picture man the right

53
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,610
so the claims will produce trees to the right answer is in fact the printing

54
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,360
tree in one way to see that the to this example let's imagine that the

55
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,660
right answer is this one and the other and so far arguments produced these blocks

56
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,770
so right now are going to start merging so we start so we start with

57
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,410
everybody in their own cluster

58
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,250
i should have said that we started in their own cluster step one and then

59
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:00,050
we repeatedly find most similar pair points in different clusters merge those clusters to

60
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,490
i suppose in this process we now have this this this this and this is

61
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,980
the claim is it or merging could be this or this or this would never

62
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,910
merged for instance this

63
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,200
so why is that well together picking the most similar pair by definition enough EX

64
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,840
here y here the sex is actually more similar to all these

65
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,360
why was more more to the so we would never have the case that these

66
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,420
two are the most

67
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,390
so you're guaranteed emerging that you're clusters are either pieces of the right answer with

68
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,240
are you collections of clusters

69
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,760
OK so this is nice because it means really

70
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,850
a very strong simple property or to imply

71
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,110
a simple our

72
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,460
here's another condition which is kind of fun

73
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,270
but you can also show sufficient to scurvy condition

74
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,830
so this one or instead we're not required everybody is strictly more similar to everybody

75
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:02,630
else cluster anybody for establishing require stability condition is kind of like the stable marriage

76
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,690
problem so using the stable marriage problem this is kind of like that for clusters

77
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,550
the condition if you have a vacuum so

78
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,690
condition we want here is for all pairs of clusters c and c prime

79
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:23,820
for all subsets a cluster c and a primary clusters prime it's not the case

80
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,540
i want not to be the case with these two

81
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:32,670
its approximation for the euclidean distance and it allows us to reduce the dimension chris

82
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:38,310
what's interesting it's very efficient search for the hamming distance

83
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:44,800
and the very few people and those of very complex operations comparison and reduces also

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,730
the the memory access so actually in the end it's times faster than the standard

85
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,990
bag of features approach

86
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,880
and so it's interesting how do we obtain

87
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,300
hamming embedding

88
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,460
so first of all we have to

89
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,440
we have to draw

90
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,810
we have to define

91
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,210
the projection directions so here would be dropped if we use we can either learn

92
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,860
them from data or we can just use

93
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,000
randomly chosen are orthogonal projections

94
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,790
we then use these matrices to protect our descriptor vectors down into some

95
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,860
this representative space

96
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,380
they determine the median

97
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,090
of descriptors which line itself

98
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,420
this is the point for comparison

99
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,490
and then

100
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,780
depending of of if the point lies on the left or the right bigger smaller

101
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,770
than the median value is either zero or one

102
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:55,030
OK so this allows us to obtain binary coding of the vectors in the cell

103
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,260
and these vectors can then be

104
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,490
compared with the hamming distance we can again use the threshold suppose you can say

105
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,110
we have to some threshold similar so they don't have to follow it have to

106
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,130
find exactly the self-same cell but they can fall into similar

107
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,880
i mean this part

108
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,520
which is similar right

109
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:19,390
and then for online computation compute the binary signature if given the script director protecting

110
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:25,330
in into according to coordinate system and finding one about development three million value the

111
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,480
way zero

112
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,400
OK so now we have representation in this space

113
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,540
and you can look at the trade between

114
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,770
memory usage x currency

115
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,430
and here what we do is like comparing the number of people right number of

116
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,250
projection directions so the maximum would be twenty to twenty eight which is the maximum

117
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,380
size of our descriptor which is the size of our descriptor

118
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,330
and it would be very very very small representation right and what you can see

119
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,610
the rate of cell points retrieved

120
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:03,220
and here the rate of five nearest neighbors retrieved we can actually see it obviously

121
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,360
the more

122
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,620
my dimensions you

123
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,990
we use the better results get

124
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,610
you can also see that even if the presentation is pretty small much better than

125
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:19,080
arbitrary filtering we do actually really improve the matching accuracy of our selves basically this

126
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,270
would be just mexico city of cells and then back the

127
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,930
systems on top of it really improves the accuracy of our matching so anybody doing

128
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,510
now be getting much closer to matching really retrieve the closest descriptors directly from set

129
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,220
of descriptors

130
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,630
and so depending on

131
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,610
if you want to favor memory or a security you can

132
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,730
you can either use the lower higher dimensions were used for the experiments we forty

133
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,970
sixty eight sixty four bit is the representation

134
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,710
and if you compare it here

135
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,110
because she had initially seen

136
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,630
for the k nearest neighbour for the k

137
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:05,010
vocabulary based on k means you can see here so basically read the curve obtained

138
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,720
by bag of words

139
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,470
and the blue ones by adding the hamming

140
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,600
hamming embedding right and what's changed on this blue curve is the distance so if

141
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,020
the distance is the for

142
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,730
number of different this to obtain the same results just obtain the results of the

143
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,040
points that fall into the cell without filtering and then then by

144
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,290
making the distance smaller and smaller we filled out more and more points we can

145
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,230
see here

146
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,680
and if you look at the current for example if you look at the curve

147
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,070
k equals

148
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,710
the point k one hundred that the blue curve you can see that for

149
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,580
for the same level of recall

150
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,520
people retrieve ten times less points right so we really improve the performance of our

151
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,650
so it really performs provide a much better trade off between recall and ambiguity of

152
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,430
what's really interesting effects

153
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,610
four very low cost so all you have to do is to start this additional

154
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,980
by these band signatures for descriptor and compare them

155
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,610
based on the bit comparison this was you have missed to still ones

156
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,590
and if you look at the example you can see here

157
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,020
OK this is this is the result obtained the hamming embedding

158
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,330
further vocabulary of twenty

159
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,850
this but you know word

160
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,140
and here is are the hamming embedding and you can really see that by adding

161
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,010
the hamming embedding

162
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,750
it allows to remove

163
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,630
four of script false matches without removing correct ones right

164
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,400
so these ones are the ones obtained just by finding descriptive words and this one

165
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,290
is the ones obtained if you to compare this to the hamming distance

166
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,730
and another example

167
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,310
again this same example if you look

168
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,220
and the much larger village of vocabulary so here two hundred thousand visual words you

169
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,590
can see that actually compared to the one to obtain embedding you don't remove was

170
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,110
may descriptors right

171
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,500
if you increase the size of the vocabulary of more more more was that

172
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,470
OK and so the second contribution

173
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,600
is the geometric consistency constraints

174
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,950
so the state of the art systems they are based

175
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,490
on the ranking with full geometric verification so what you do once the system has

176
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,770
returned to short list of images is take for example if a hundred best retrieved

177
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,970
images when you verify the german consistency between the query image and the returned images

178
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:39,510
example by estimating homography based on the matches between the two images right and this

179
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,770
is pretty costly

180
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,870
so you can

181
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:46,870
definitely not familiar images people can i add to four hundred but you could also

182
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,600
go straight up two thousand

183
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,040
however if you look at the graph here so when you look what you see

184
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,110
on the x axis you see the size of the dataset right and the the

185
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,190
more increases

186
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,730
the more

187
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,960
the rate of relevant images in the shortlist decreases right so here you can see

188
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,940
here if you have one million of images images which are in the short list

189
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,610
here if you take a short list of one hundred images only twenty percent

190
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,660
of the correct t twenty images in the short list

191
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,730
so basically here even if you user the geometric verification many nice

192
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,610
image is missing so basically the ones which are in here we can move them

193
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,140
in the in the shortest ranking but all the others you won't find them even

194
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,130
if you go up to one thousand images you can see still see

195
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,270
only fifty percent of the images have returned so many of them missing right so

196
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:41,950
you have to

197
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:47,010
so what thought about how can improve this without going up to the full

198
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,850
geometric verification so the idea of

199
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,620
is to introduce

200
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,080
some very simple german quite quite consistency checks

201
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,860
which can be implemented all images and not just for short list of images so

202
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,280
in the military for the millions of images and so what is our approach based

203
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:12,730
so yes initially that we extract effect of invariant image regions right so for each

204
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,870
region we have for example

205
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:20,890
seven find information scale and rotation angle associated with you can see actually the size

206
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,500
of the region is the scale

207
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,470
the rotation angle is the is some some angle which gives the rotation of the

208
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:33,030
innovation to x-rays and so you need the different tools and carbon ions

209
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,320
i think it's which today are considered to be the best

210
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,830
numbers of potential patients now i ask you to read this number into scale

211
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,750
two your own country likely enough you can have so many accounts so you can

212
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,530
compute how many

213
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:55,550
potential applications that are in your country folk cultures and down on the first those

214
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:00,400
number that you should not forget every ten million inhabitants in the which was twenty

215
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,630
thousand patients a year can exploit

216
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:09,170
is after all the people getting accounts for forty thousand pounds of ten million inhabitants

217
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,530
per year after them are treated with x-rays together with

218
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,530
chemotherapy and surgery many that's what that according to studies made in the framework of

219
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,560
the light bulb mentioned but later for percentage of the should get protontherapy today this

220
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,890
is that made in this country two thousand four hundred

221
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,780
and with carbon ions four assistant you should be three percent of them so six

222
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,560
so you see there are three thousand pages and

223
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,830
if i you remember to do that

224
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,960
normally in that case one thousand five hundred patients per year

225
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,340
he began sentech the complete two thousand patients but you means that one needs at

226
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,780
least today

227
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,370
the centre of the type issued new every ten million inhabitants which is very far

228
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,390
from what we have in hand in the world

229
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:06,710
one of the centres for carbon ion therapy centers for company said the one is

230
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,870
this a high or

231
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:15,680
the center in fact is not new it started in two thousand seven but for

232
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,220
carbon ions only treated patients for a couple of years

233
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,920
it is made by mitsubishi is a single from twenty five metres lin

234
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,700
as you

235
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,460
think and and focal tools and tools for carbon c

236
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:37,700
his ontology particularly inclined to this is the centre the second sentence in japan then

237
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,700
come back there

238
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,440
of carbon and so p is expanding the facility to add new facility with the

239
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,460
minimum standards so this will be working very so so in japan it would be

240
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:56,590
and there is this such thing to be three sentence to sentence in two years

241
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,510
and in four years three centres for carbon ions in the good design has pushed

242
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:08,260
the construction heidelberg obvious center which is called heat hydrogen ions have been

243
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,770
this is close to the ospital in heidelberg

244
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,530
the medical that they always looked to the user should utility doctor other physicists techniques

245
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,060
like this is synchrotron the that

246
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,670
and again to in almost and because

247
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,700
the band

248
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,580
carbon ions from this energy take three times more field

249
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,800
or use then to bend problems

250
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:39,150
both treatment so you need much more again much larger much larger and issued this

251
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,400
this again this is the same

252
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,380
the center this building

253
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,000
you see this again is twenty four metres

254
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:53,310
it's not as complicated as CMS but it is quite a complicated object to put

255
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:59,310
a gnostic tendency is not to put this in their all space so the just

256
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,810
is large to put such again in hospital then the jump to put to sea

257
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,970
it's the

258
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,530
the patient is sitting here and siemens medical is

259
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,780
taken all those

260
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,900
knowledge from just built you see

261
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,090
this global system in which the patients who received very soon because the first patient

262
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,510
treated within months and this is the same of carbon ions which showed set of

263
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,450
course the patient

264
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,320
come for carbon ions to be less than four total ten twenty times only to

265
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,540
the center but we see all

266
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,310
there is zero which is not very different from an

267
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,080
because you see here

268
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,550
the foundation there which i created with friends in nineteen two

269
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,250
has done two things

270
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,350
we have proposed and designed the dual national center will is the when you accelerate

271
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,000
carbon ions can also photos

272
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,940
which is being built in the south of milan long as also and then designing

273
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:04,330
new works type of accelerator call cyclinac football also carbon ions something about this

274
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,850
this is a project which i started when i was at

275
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,460
all right

276
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,390
last but not least a few things about writing

277
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,650
writing one of the those things that you might be able to tell from this

278
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,480
little board over here is something if i didn't have to do i wouldn't do

279
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,320
it because i honestly as corn is the sound i just believe in the love

280
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,880
of learning like i think it's passion about something just go do it you learning

281
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,410
but i'm naive and so that's not the way learning always works sometimes we actually

282
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,700
need grading to make sure the learning takes place in the desired rate breaks down

283
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,820
forty five percent of your great is on the programme this time k

284
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,380
fifteen percent in the mid term which is called the media because we like to

285
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,860
abbreviate everything thirty percent in the final

286
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,620
it's a three hour final exam in the regular final time slot for this class

287
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,840
if you think you are under the delusion that you should take two classes the

288
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,190
same time that bad idea because their final exams at the same time OK so

289
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,470
you should not take the exact two classes the same time and because the final

290
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,490
exam is scheduled for i believe it's december thirteenth which is the thursday twelve fifteen

291
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,270
to three fifteen that's the regular final exams slot for this class in any other

292
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,220
cluster the same time will conflict with that slide thirty percent generated the final and

293
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,700
that if you add it all up

294
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,150
it's not just that map it's because ten percent of the great is actually participation

295
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,770
and this is things like did you go to your interactive training sessions did you

296
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:32,400
regularly attend section did you participate in section they do participate in class right and

297
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,710
so in order to help you participate in class

298
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,660
there is little incentive to participate in class which is sugar in the afternoon so

299
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,350
someone raised their hand

300
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,920
all right

301
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,600
yeah i sometimes i'm not a good shot and this will tell you if you're

302
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,620
sitting in the back of i i tend to kick back because there are little

303
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:58,030
outside it is in the back of the room the roof prevents me from actually

304
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,190
being able to hear you so if you want to food come up but if

305
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,910
you ask questions in class

306
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,730
and that's a good time it's just a way to be able to reward you

307
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,970
for actually participating in class or to keep your blood sugar up if you need

308
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,310
all right so that's participation attempt any random and effective end the quarter i ask

309
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,700
everyone your section leaders to actually tell me how much to participate in class and

310
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,900
some of them you know to salespersons wonderful became every time he participated it's just

311
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,820
great thing and that helps you great out a lot

312
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,320
now the final thing and as you can can tell most of the time not

313
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,200
the most serious person in the world i would like to have fun things i

314
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,570
think it's important for you to have one thing there's just one place where i

315
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:39,700
get real serious and it's one place where stanford real serious and we want to

316
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,070
guess what that is

317
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,590
plagiarism and the honor code that fact that's what we call social so we have

318
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,070
someone down here

319
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,220
and then all the people who i don't know

320
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,950
we just spread

321
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,380
the honor code

322
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:02,050
in terms of the honor code the question comes up is what is the code

323
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,990
all about how does that affect working in you know groups in computer science et

324
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,150
cetera the i mean we shouldn't talk each each other no

325
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,300
the answer to all those is no OK if you look at hand i number

326
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,670
four which is all about the honor code we encourage you to talk to each

327
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,280
other we encourage you to talk about concepts in the class talk about different strategies

328
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,180
to problems to think about the way that you could potentially approach some problem or

329
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,300
the way different control construction and eventually get them work in the class and discussion

330
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:33,340
is perfectly fine especially among the core staff but also amongst yourself that's the great

331
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,910
thing so where do we draw the line we try to make a bright line

332
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,200
for where you've crossed the line for the honor code which is

333
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,050
i don't know

334
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,550
share code

335
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,950
plain and simple

336
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,340
in any respect

337
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,050
OK don't give a file to someone else's car code don't get code from someone

338
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:55,450
else to look at someone else's print out don't give them print out if you

339
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,380
have two people who were sitting looking at the same screen together that code can

340
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,700
belong to both of you it belongs to one of you i don't know which

341
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,260
one but it becomes an honor code violation so you should both you know two

342
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,740
people should be staring at the monitor together if it ever gets the point where

343
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,320
you're looking at someone else's code that's where you're going to reach an issue hey

344
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,800
discusses much as you want that's great

345
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,820
write your own code that's all we care about and you're like well what is

346
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,900
called now what that would mean code is speak for your program so when you

347
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,050
program the program that write is what we affectionately referred to as cold and the

348
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:33,410
idea of programming is what we refer to as coding strangely enough we just you

349
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,680
know we computer i need to make everything more complicated than it really is so

350
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,150
we can get people under the illusion that they should pay lots of money to

351
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,610
do what we do and you're like i just write programs like i actually pay

352
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,260
you have you know i write code now like i certainly it's much more impressive

353
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,150
they don't jericho code the other thing is if you talk to other people like

354
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,820
the other study group to talk about solution approaches or you go to talk to

355
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,030
the tears section leader to how you should approach to problem and they give you

356
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:04,860
a lot of hints as to how to do it say collaboration

357
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,130
so citing collaboration gets you out of trouble any collaboration that you say you cannot

358
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,820
be held responsible for the honor code you can actually copy someone else's program and

359
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,150
say i copied this program for mary smith and look at the same

360
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,820
they cited and i will warm the cockles of my heart and marry smith will

361
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,610
get full credit you get a zero because you copied your program from mary smith

362
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,280
but it's not an honor code violation because you cited one

363
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,380
the bottom line is cheap yourself safe and secure collaborations and i guarantee you most

364
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,430
of the time will be just fine now you might wonder why do i make

365
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,970
a big deal about this and the reason i make a big deal about this

366
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,150
is for a while thankfully it's not sure anymore before while the computer science department

367
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:52,880
actually had more honor code violations than the rest of the university combined taken every

368
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,950
everything else in the universe university put them all together they like over like work

369
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:04,010
which is not fine distinction have and you might wonder why is that the the

370
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,360
science people just mischievious and dishonest you know

371
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,260
it's because it's easier to catch honor code violations in computer science we have a

372
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,720
whole bunch of tools that allows the we take all your programs and run through

373
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,880
this tool on comparison not only to everyone else in here but like to everyone

374
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,740
from the last like x years where x is the large number of people have

375
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,340
ever gone through the classes

376
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,700
right and it's an extremely good tool from finding where honor code violations happen from

377
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,110
where they don't know that's find you know spurious violations to be you know be

378
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,680
honest i've never lost another key coast what i find not OK honor code case

379
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,540
simply here t

380
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,990
and that requires the integration is basically the integration of this distribution is an almighty

381
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,470
to make sure there's no my one

382
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,010
we have to perform this integration

383
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,890
integration can't be done analytically

384
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,950
certainly should say

385
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,930
the choices of priors that will be realistic to use

386
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,220
could use some contrived prize which might work but they wouldn't be sensible

387
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,820
in this application we can't do this and

388
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,620
so a little bit later will look actually doing is numerically shape that still has

389
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,310
some value

390
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,040
mister success we can't do this idealized procedure

391
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,320
look at how

392
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,950
if we contact is precisely how we might approximate

393
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:33,230
this is sort of pragmatic deviation from the true path if you like

394
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,570
someone david so as we well i talked about being practically pragmatic

395
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,680
when being bayesian inference and this is an example of that

396
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,640
we can't get back full posterior distribution that we want

397
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,660
so we need an approximation

398
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,580
there is

399
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,700
there are number approximation methods this kind of problem

400
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,740
i'm using a particular one

401
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,120
it's called type two maximum likelihood

402
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,350
it's kind of motivated by the idea

403
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,770
that one should

404
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,060
a bit of this distribution

405
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,670
you can calculate

406
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,110
and then do something about the count

407
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,820
so we decompose it so this is

408
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,730
follows on from the other rule of probability

409
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,600
this is an identity we get these two terms

410
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,820
you recognise this one perhaps this is the posterior distribution over the weights looked at

411
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,250
we know we can calculate

412
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:31,930
at least the second term in the product and that's the bit can't calculate

413
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,010
so we can actually

414
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,680
work at the numerator this distribution but we can't normalise

415
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,330
so is this has to be

416
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,660
approximated i'm calling it the hyperparameter posterior

417
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:51,390
the joint posterior distribution over the hyperparameter alpha and the noise variance sigma

418
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:55,060
so this is where the idea type two maximum likelihood comes in this is an

419
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,700
established idea statistics

420
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,910
we start off by

421
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,230
looking at what this actually distribution and we can explain it

422
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,950
by bayes rule

423
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:07,040
so this is based rules

424
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,510
to give us this

425
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,850
and we have to specify

426
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,920
obviously users coming

427
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,300
prior over alpha the prior sigma squared

428
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,250
this goes back to the question i was at the end

429
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,680
but how we specify

430
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,390
high price and could keep going on and on

431
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,370
one thing we can do

432
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,200
we can express what i call

433
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:34,690
uninformative or non informative priors on the hyperparameters

434
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,810
and we can simply make them uniform so we can say

435
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,480
we don't actually care

436
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,620
what value these take on going to do in my prior

437
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,620
it just simply say have a uniform probability distribution

438
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,720
not adding any information into the problem

439
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,940
now you'll notice that have actually

440
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,810
it's going to be uniform distribution logarithmic space

441
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,950
and this

442
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,000
one of two possible reasons for doing that

443
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,640
because these

444
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,620
well of called scale parameters that actually variances in this area here

445
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,350
space on which the model

446
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,370
probabilistically is the logarithmic space

447
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,750
and the practical explanation of why that's the case is

448
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,930
sign data t that we measured

449
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,810
was being measurements of length and we were measuring eighteen metres

450
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,850
but then someone else could some data which is exactly the same but they measured

451
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,810
in inches

452
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,690
some reasons for this reason

453
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,050
if we don't make these

454
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,310
prize uniform over long scale

455
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,810
we find that are and we get a different answer to the problem according to

456
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,370
the units of measurement

457
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,010
because any other priors wouldn't be invariant to scale

458
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,250
after rescaling t

459
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,140
so if you believe in your problem but it doesn't matter what the units of

460
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,470
measurement are

461
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,350
then in principle you should choose

462
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,990
i priors over these variables

463
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,010
that are uniform logarithmic scale

464
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,540
just a little bit of an aside

465
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,590
so once we have agreed

466
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,320
these can be uniform

467
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,960
they don't affect the shape of the distribution

468
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,070
in logarithmic space

469
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,620
the key term is therefore this

470
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,850
type two maximum likelihood

471
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:22,440
we want to maximize find the most probable values under this posterior distribution so we

472
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,760
don't calculate the whole posterior

473
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,260
we simply do this rather non bayesian thing

474
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,470
and calculate the maximum so that we do the MAP estimate the weights

475
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,800
doing something similar

476
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,160
i the hyperparameters here

477
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:41,570
if we want to maximize this we maximize this to

478
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,660
and this term is called the marginal likelihood

479
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,960
that's really what the phrase type two maximum likelihood comes from

480
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,590
because robert doing maximum likelihood of the parameters

481
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:56,730
we integrate out the parameters and we do maximum likelihood over this marginal likelihood

482
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,500
the the ninth of

483
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,370
what does it look like less i said

484
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,320
it's simply the likelihood of the data this

485
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,490
appeared earlier was gassing life data

486
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,230
this is the gas in private the weights we had earlier

487
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,450
so we integrate out the weights

488
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,350
that gives this marginal likelihood

489
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,970
which is no longer conditioned on the weights those have been integrated and the nuisance

490
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,970
but it still depends on the hyperparameters

491
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,360
OK so

492
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,000
let's start our development fails to have a document

493
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,370
we need to define what is documented what

494
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,950
the document has

495
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,370
and what we're going to do with this document

496
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,440
usually information world

497
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,910
in march

498
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,730
all the books that are at the root of this topic

499
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,100
which is pretty simple

500
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,840
i have a collection of documents and documents can be divided into work

501
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:02,430
but in real life i haven't seen any search engine that really used such a

502
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,960
very simple approach

503
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:09,670
so usually have collection and collection simply sat of all documents that we are going

504
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,410
to put into our search engine

505
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:19,560
what usually we can divide this collection subcollection even if internet

506
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,250
we can for example divided into that

507
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:29,510
based on geography which in turn different countries and we can treat it differently so

508
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
some somehow we need to

509
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,130
collect this information

510
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,040
but the document is not very simple all

511
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,880
is so what is the current document looking a document is usually divided into the

512
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:48,020
and you know search engine will have document that is divided into few

513
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,440
and every field campaign

514
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,840
contains work

515
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,720
so what about this field

516
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:57,110
title of the document a good example of a few

517
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:04,450
command of what script if we are indifferent email and and subject to another huge

518
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,750
for male lead for for email

519
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:14,090
why do we need all this stuff why do we need to cover the document

520
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,320
something more complex like we need to extract few and died or tighter or other

521
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,360
uses separate part of the document and we need to

522
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:30,080
this particular war belongs to this field

523
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,860
for our relevant for our judgement going to do

524
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,220
the result

525
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,840
it could be a little

526
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,660
and we discovered that we need to extract features

527
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,460
and this is feature

528
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,980
and war belongs to

529
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,850
title this is the feature

530
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,990
that can be used in the system for all processes can be used for ranking

531
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,710
it can be used simply for because the user can

532
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,170
type the query i needed documentary this particular word in the title

533
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,720
and therefore we need to extract all this information

534
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,060
and extraction information

535
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,740
from documents

536
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,230
there are many more for extraction in for extraction was from documents

537
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,350
the one before that

538
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,060
mind it may be the most popular artistic innovation canonization rendering have text and get

539
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,940
to work

540
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,710
but i don't like this for the canonization

541
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,610
i like more innovation

542
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:39,360
because for the canonization real information full innovation we get information about the document and

543
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,710
what we get from the news station the kind of our

544
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,370
our document from some form

545
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,830
in two linear least of

546
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,460
some attributes

547
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,960
for all search engine is is this

548
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,100
the feature set

549
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,960
this is the official said that we are extracted from the

550
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,200
on the left on this slide this is not

551
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,190
comment from shakespeare

552
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,490
but imagine that

553
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,770
it is

554
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,870
these of our

555
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:18,420
and on the right is something that should be extracted from from these documents so

556
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,860
to be or not to be

557
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,360
and what we see what we can see here

558
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:29,660
i imagine that it was document after

559
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:36,640
optical character recognition therefore b is OK so what we have we have

560
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,100
to be or not to be

561
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:43,780
and for this for for every word we extracted this road i want to remind

562
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,330
you for search so expected to work

563
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,510
the exact position

564
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,360
the extracted fields

565
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,410
and the extracted some idea of documents in this case it will would be example

566
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:01,350
all the information in order linear

567
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,940
OK so it sounds great pretty simple but what are the features we can extract

568
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,050
from it

569
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,860
for specific single state

570
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,360
you can do it in time independent of size of state space

571
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,130
can anybody think of equivalent algorithm for

572
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,720
the optimal control problem

573
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,240
support i told you

574
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,070
find for me

575
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,150
the optimal action state five

576
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,510
how can i any state

577
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,340
can you think of the way

578
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,300
the optimal action state five

579
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,530
in time

580
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,490
independent aside the state space

581
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,380
it's more challenging but let's see if somebody can

582
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:47,130
think with this

583
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,840
i'm saying i don't care about any interstate justified

584
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,380
public reaction to that state five

585
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,050
and give so no direct method

586
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,590
and giving him more can

587
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:04,420
do whatever you want with the model

588
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,220
this is the higher one

589
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,800
the montecarlo

590
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,630
that and

591
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:25,880
in is really really straightforward in hindsight is really straightforward the the interesting interesting idea

592
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,130
is not the algorithm somebody analysis but

593
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:35,380
it's out by bikers shaman and during its called sparse sampling out idea

594
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,220
starting state five

595
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,590
and try every action state five

596
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,880
say ten times

597
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,450
each time the next day

598
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,800
we should states

599
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,700
try every five every action ten times

600
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,510
keep doing this

601
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,700
for certain death

602
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,760
you've been our

603
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,180
and back at the values from the leaves of the tree

604
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,530
signs zero values in the leaves of the tree

605
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,680
and assume that tree

606
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,010
is the model and is do

607
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:11,650
backwards value induction already

608
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,440
and big the action of the root which is state five

609
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:20,470
it looks the best industry

610
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,400
they were able to show

611
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,530
the number of times the for try every action

612
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,490
in each state

613
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,150
completely independent

614
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,570
four thousand state space

615
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,650
by the same

616
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,990
monte carlo

617
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,300
invariance property

618
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,840
so there to prove it you get near optimal action the root state

619
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,900
in time independent of the size of the state space of course

620
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,090
in kind of exponential

621
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,760
on the horizon

622
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:54,590
what's the horizon sort of gammas gammas point nine the norris and will be whatever

623
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:57,740
power your career began becomes

624
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,510
in you know in fact very small

625
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:06,050
by the time horizon termite i gamma discount factor smaller the discount factor close to

626
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:09,320
zero small but exponential right

627
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,590
by the base of the expert the number of action yes

628
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:16,900
and it should be fairly clear right why does make sense let me just say

629
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:23,050
one more thing answer question what makes sense is because we take samples

630
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,380
multiple samples of an action

631
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,720
the number of samples you need in order to get a good estimate of the

632
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:33,130
is going to be independent of the number of possible xt

633
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,510
but as a monte carlo approach

634
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:41,050
mean make sure you understand because of that beautiful result if you don't notice

635
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,630
right now if i were take

636
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,010
estimate the expectation of random variable

637
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:49,090
and do the obvious thing to do the sample average by the draw eighty samples

638
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,050
of the random variable and average them

639
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,970
the number of samples i need

640
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:57,670
you get data a lot got and so the square who would look something like

641
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:03,790
this as it rotates that or scales would you get is shifts along either axis

642
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:08,770
if you then realigned that the center of mass you have scale the rotation variance

643
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,530
in afforded space which is translation vary you just get in in various space so

644
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:18,890
these are some of the properties your brain uses for seeing this goes a lot

645
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:28,770
deeper into her other things the brains doing to compressed so scales spaces a reducing

646
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:34,570
images by filtering city of the gals in pyramid and and it's reverse to generate

647
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:40,670
the image back which gives you the pyramid of edges that's all of these adjust

648
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:45,750
functions and their there's all kinds of threshold including adaptive threshold so this images to

649
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,890
darken light for anyone threshold to pick up the black and white squares as you

650
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:57,630
can see here but this adaptive local thresholding can pick out all the squares this

651
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:01,930
is a picture I took of Yellowstone those all washed out by Haiti's that the

652
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:09,690
histogram equalization makes it clear justice smattering of routines contour operators so how you might

653
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:16,630
extract by thresholding or other considerations contours and we have contour operators that you know

654
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:22,490
you're you're working in a in a a year and squared world pixels here too

655
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:27,090
late to when you convert to come tourist you converted to linear problem only operating

656
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:33,690
on the region's the linear regions of interest morphological operators that pick out parts of

657
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:39,790
an image these very fast local operators and by recombined them in in certain ways

658
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,420
their Maxim and operators that that crawl around the image that can be done very

659
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,210
efficiently and then by Ray combining them and in different ways you can get all

660
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:54,950
kinds of effects picking out data eliminating kinds of data that the different frequencies here's

661
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:59,750
a inpainting so this is just more more the techniques this is actually written in

662
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:03,550
the image of the pixels have all but turned agreeing here and then this is

663
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:10,410
restoring that image from from this damaged image it just tells it to restore you

664
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:15,540
know those areas of attacks that here it is unique IAC that EU there has

665
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:21,280
it has a happiness not quite restored correctly this red pen on the screen it

666
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,670
can touch but but this so this is useful for a lot of things including

667
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:34,530
blending things into images by it does a texture in filling this is something I

668
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:39,050
use in the DARPA Grand challenge this robot race across the desert so there's a

669
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:45,430
segmentation algorithm that that watershed transform that sort of like creating hills and valleys and

670
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:50,220
the gradients in the image and then if you can tell something is outside and

671
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,750
something is inside it'll do the segmentation you so that we that was 1 of

672
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:59,840
the techniques we tried and segmenting roads from injury ultimately we did a modeling a

673
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,890
color space and that in work on a robot that ran for 7 hours across

674
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:12,770
the desert never fail division never failed the lasers fell 3 times but it so

675
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:18,300
it is also the segmentation energy base segmentation years of separating myself from the background

676
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:23,250
and the robots by giving hints so you can have hints and depth and other

677
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:30,370
hands that's getting the segmentation grab cut it is a graph that algorithm energy minimization

678
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:34,250
technique but what it does is it starts over the EMU just give the overall

679
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,250
box and say I want to pull out that and then you can give other

680
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:44,920
hints of what's inside and outside you can give hot and soft hands these motions

681
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:51,590
templates this is just a normal optical flow soaking get area so wet that stamp

682
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:58,390
together in time and take gradients and you get so I I did this a

683
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:02,250
long time ago and and somehow these are gone around the Internet see set to

684
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:09,670
music but at that but it felt that because there's optical flow which is the

685
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,750
emotion tracking as the basis of a lot of things struck structure promotion and movies

686
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:23,690
use densely his structured optical flow of constraint to be on a faced this was

687
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:30,270
a year I mean shift algorithm which I expect that applied this robust statistic to

688
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:35,350
tracking and now it's a fairly common technique but here we used it for controlling

689
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:40,010
game turns out using your head to control the game is a really bad idea

690
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:44,290
that it's not that you do this for a few who bit for a couple

691
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:50,030
of minutes and then you stand with a neck brace for the week but the

692
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:59,050
feel that prospective transform so are fine and and full perspective from warping the plane

693
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:03,110
that are used for fitting that we have a whole section of stereo so the

694
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:10,530
this is

695
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:41,960
so you should

696
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:50,270
one the

697
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,920
so we want to

698
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,170
one the things that matter

699
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,230
they want

700
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,430
how old

701
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:40,920
so that

702
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,410
and so are actually

703
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:52,250
the situation which

704
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:03,280
all approach

705
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:30,780
then when we want to to share

706
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:40,610
should say that

707
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:48,270
so we

708
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:21,220
this is one of those things

709
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,800
prior over all possible linear separators

710
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,350
and we just take all of the linear separators that

711
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:28,290
classifier training set

712
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:32,150
and we can we take what would be the average prediction variance average of hyperplanes

713
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,980
your effectively get everything tilted that way

714
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:40,290
and the intuition behind this is that i have that i have an angle of

715
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:44,720
hyperplanes so i can have a hyperplane that's mostly flat which metric class for the

716
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,440
data correctly a hyperplane which is

717
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:51,790
angle this direction which would also classified data correctly and the angle between would also

718
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:56,460
class correctly and so the average solution is essentially the minimal angle the mid angle

719
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,480
between those two extremes

720
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:03,730
and in a sense this also has a maximum margin property you could argue because

721
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:06,980
it tries to stay away from that point as well as interest try to stay

722
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,310
away from these points having at that point in the first step away from that

723
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:13,050
even though the

724
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,470
in theory the actual margin way people normally compute margin has increased by tiny tiny

725
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:19,170
amounts by having this

726
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,550
as the fight using this your solution you actually gain a lot more in terms

727
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:27,730
of representing a posterior better

728
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,540
OK so so what i'm going to do is going to challenge the idea that

729
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:34,170
that that the marginal economic candidate is really the right thing to use instead we

730
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:38,730
should consider the posterior over hyperplanes has being the correct criteria and most of the

731
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:43,920
time it to coincide quite well the margin may disagree by tiny tiny bit

732
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:49,670
so you can also think of this problem in parameter space

733
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,480
so what i've done years i have mapped the

734
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,890
data that i had in the previous slide

735
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,240
in two into what looks like an paris-based when you think about what the posterior

736
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,290
looks like

737
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,400
let me just describe what what the posterior looks like so mathematically if we think

738
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,540
of what a linear classification problem is

739
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:12,150
it's that we have some feature vectors XII which are two-dimensional in the previous case

740
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,170
and we have this weight vector w

741
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:17,380
and the linear classifiers one is simply says know i think the inner product of

742
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,610
the weights with the feature vector to the gradients are less than zero with great

743
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:25,340
endurance in class one trillion classes

744
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:32,330
the magnitude of that w vectors irrelevant skilled w vectors irrelevant so well also generally

745
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,170
i can just say to point on the sphere

746
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,240
i consider the norm w was one

747
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:38,510
and so in two dimensions

748
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,430
if i buy impose a constraint i said you get a point on the sphere

749
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:47,270
being my primary factors so basically any set of weights

750
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,040
corresponds to some point on the sphere

751
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:52,810
and actually so

752
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:56,840
let me just correct myself so w is actually three dimensional because i'm including a

753
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,170
bias term

754
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,240
so you're allowed to shift the boundary as well

755
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,040
so in other words the

756
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:05,780
data points implicitly have featured there's always one

757
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,170
and that gives me the ability to shift the voluntary

758
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:12,380
and so that's w is actually three dimensional vector when imposed the norm constraint i

759
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,330
have two degrees of freedom left and that's why the point on the surface of

760
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:17,160
the sphere

761
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,790
so this fear is basically my prior space i'm going to have a posterior distribution

762
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,830
now where these hyperplanes come from where each of the data points turns into a

763
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,710
hyperplane that because this sphere

764
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,570
and we can see that is again by looking at these constraints of i know

765
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,910
that have the classifier certain point as class one

766
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:39,170
then looking at this equation i can interpret that as a constraint on w that

767
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:44,320
saying that the w has live in a certain half space

768
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:48,380
so the set of all of these were w transpose x is greater than zero

769
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,430
corresponds to some have placed have

770
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,570
half space and no

771
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,750
well i think

772
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,150
i have it because it is a

773
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:00,830
half of the space covered by hyperplane so

774
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,170
so he basically each data point is a hyperplane and have to be on one

775
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,940
side or other of the hyperplane

776
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:09,800
is a three data points have three hyperplanes are cutting the sphere

777
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,170
and the intersection of all of those constraints is this

778
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:17,170
weirdly shaped region on the surface of the sphere

779
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:20,760
yes well was

780
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,410
so if your data is not linearly separable then

781
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,500
then these hard constraints can be satisfied and you would have you wouldn't you wouldn't

782
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:34,770
have any region where they would intersect in that case you can soften is constrained

783
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,920
you can obviously softener you'd have to soften it and you would say that that

784
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,280
instead of requiring this be exactly positive you can have some soft nonlinearity making the

785
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,290
positive the reason i don't think that is because you don't have nice pictures so

786
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:50,140
and i'm sure you can you can do everything about the say

787
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,790
with those kinds of soft likelihood as well

788
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:55,410
but you get the nice pictures with the hard likely going to stick with the

789
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,930
higher likelihood for now

790
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,920
OK so

791
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,220
a posterior distribution over hyperplanes is weirdly shaped

792
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,620
what i plotted years i've plotted plotted point

793
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:15,820
corresponding the hyperplanes i showed you in the previous slide so the hyperplane chosen by

794
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,320
the SVM which is the

795
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:21,260
which is the maximum margin hyperplane response to this particular point

796
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:22,300
on the sphere

797
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:26,440
and the point that i was calling the bayes optimal solution response to this point

798
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,890
on the sphere

799
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:31,040
and in terms of private space you can see why

800
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:34,170
the bayes optimal is it is essentially the average solution

801
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:38,670
symmetry and yes you can you can do it on graph paper doesn't doesn't take

802
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:47,720
much more stable as a result but nevertheless this is the stylized version were these

803
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:53,760
prototypes that reflective symmetry and you can see very clearly that if you draw reflection

804
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:58,030
it's definitely not a reflection line

805
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,320
of the whole

806
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:03,880
and so he could and this is the only way these birds go together

807
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,970
you can't

808
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:09,940
you can put them together and the other way so can clear these types of

809
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,240
symmetric tiles that is the tiles

810
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,420
has symmetry

811
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,220
that is not present in any translation by them

812
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,470
and it's still not known today

813
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:25,280
what kinds of

814
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:32,130
but symmetry groups admit i symmetric tiles and which ones do

815
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:35,800
what this where the lines of symmetry can be

816
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:41,260
whether they lines or with centers symmetry because you it's possible to have rotation symmetry

817
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,650
but not is that is not a symmetry of the whole tiling so then you

818
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:48,190
have this global

819
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,920
question of symmetry

820
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,300
so issues work has actually

821
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:57,760
i presented some very interesting mathematical problems

822
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,050
with regard

823
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:02,360
two symmetry this whole question of local

824
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,150
versus global

825
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:15,670
explored some different symmetry groups not just plane symmetry groups here we have an icosahedron

826
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:20,380
of that was printed with some very beautiful arrangements of shells

827
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,220
and these are printed so they pick up

828
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:28,690
some of the cemeteries not all symmetries but the rotation symmetries of the icosahedron

829
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,570
he also did this in hard spheres

830
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:35,360
the twelve fish on this sphere

831
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:42,110
o a range beautiful asymmetrically so that this actually has the symmetry group of the

832
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:45,670
the rotation symmetry group of the tetrahedron

833
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,820
he also explored

834
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:53,110
the hyperbolic plane symmetry there

835
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,090
this was not that the blue

836
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:59,170
but rather the result

837
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:04,300
receiving the paper on symmetry that was written by the mathematician

838
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:06,460
HSM coxeter

839
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,960
the paper was written in nineteen fifty seven and coxeter

840
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:13,670
requested actually permission to use

841
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:18,440
some of ashes tests relations to illustrate plane symmetry

842
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:20,420
and then as a courtesy

843
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:23,320
coxeter sent the paper to asher

844
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,880
so he could see

845
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,260
how his

846
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,990
test solutions to period and

847
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:35,740
that the paper was a complete survey not just players symmetry but spherical and hyperbolic

848
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:43,690
and on this page shows all for the first time a hyperbolic cancellation of triangles

849
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,340
and some of you may be able to see there's actually some pencil markings this

850
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:53,900
is actually actual copy of the paper and he clearly to compress and tried to

851
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,280
figure out

852
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:01,190
how to get the scaffolding so that you can make these circles

853
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:05,570
and he figured this out he did correspond with coxeter

854
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:06,860
and as can

855
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,440
four how do this and

856
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:16,070
the are other kinds and what coxeter back actually called hocus pocus

857
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,130
and it really is

858
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,280
but it was not trying to be

859
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,550
snobbish he was not trying to be unhelpful

860
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:28,740
but just being a mathematician he was speaking

861
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,280
that you can

862
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,260
and the technical language and so

863
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,960
he really wasn't much help at all as you really have to figure this out

864
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,940
on his own

865
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:42,970
and to try something like that into something like this

866
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:45,150
it's quite amazing

867
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,740
so he did four different circle prince

868
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:51,150
which of course all given

869
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:54,820
illustrations of some hyperbolic symmetry groups

870
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:01,670
he also exploit similarity

871
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:08,530
you have a nice print will you have this rotation symmetry but you also have

872
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,420
shrinking towards the centre

873
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:15,320
dilation is

874
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:20,130
and here is another example of one that has for symmetry but again towards the

875
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:26,800
centre you have similarity or dilation symmetry

876
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:29,240
this is one

877
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:33,220
has four fold rotation symmetry

878
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,970
does not fit into the category

879
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,300
have any of the

880
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,030
what we require is that true

881
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,690
four point groups in the plane

882
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,970
each of these fish

883
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:51,510
is related to a small one

884
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:55,630
and in fact they all of

885
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:59,630
you can see this this year smaller and smaller and smaller

886
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:04,880
they are true similar images but there is no similarity there's no dilation

887
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,920
that will take this fish on to this fish

888
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:11,190
and the fish on to its image here and so on

889
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,550
this print was made

890
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:17,650
in this scheme completely divided by asher

891
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,030
but he wrote to coxeter explaining

892
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:25,940
this is as own picture of explaining how to begin with the central square

893
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:32,420
cut into four triangles and then this gets come into two and this small square

894
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:38,130
cut into two and so on and so forth and rhythmic so similar

895
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,860
we could serve

896
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:41,960
of producing

897
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,970
similar figures

898
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:48,010
and not related to any symmetry group at all

899
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,610
so although

900
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,440
we have this symmetry is invariant

901
00:58:54,340 --> 00:59:00,170
what kind of invariance is this it's not it's not a group in the usual

902
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:04,010
sense of the word and that's to another

903
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:08,860
i might say mystery or problem or challenge the asher brings to us

904
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,570
it's possible to have regular repetition

905
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,840
it's possible to have without symmetry groups

906
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:18,550
no one yet has really figured out

907
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:20,990
or presented any kind of theory

908
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,300
four really repetition

909
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:28,920
without symmetry groups and that's a real challenge and particularly in light today of things

910
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:34,920
like a periodic tiling which have a lot of repetition in a very orderly manner

911
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:39,090
we really need to look for the new series beyond symmetry groups

912
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:42,900
there was one other

913
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,690
idea that's esther had that was quite original

914
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:48,760
and that is

915
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,260
the symmetry

916
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,900
should be compatible

917
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,780
with the following the symmetry of the tiling if you were not colored should be

918
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:02,050
compatible with the coloring this is the

919
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:03,970
and they explain

920
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,500
the high higher level

921
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:10,380
these considerations are generally yes

922
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:11,130
and so

923
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,460
you can really argue

924
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,160
the computer finds only finitely many configurations

925
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:22,920
because of the way the generation has been set up

926
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:26,060
you know those are all the possible cases

927
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:32,080
you can imagine how many cases are going to have and you have to let

928
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,670
the computer

929
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,460
but the way the computer program

930
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:41,550
and the principles by which you get these considerations completely understandable

931
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,830
but you don't know

932
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,290
that the computer search will come in a

933
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,670
when it does terminate realized that

934
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,500
the proof is in

935
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,870
so i think that's a perfectly adequate idea of proof

936
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,700
because we we have to be examined

937
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:02,040
computer programs basis of them we that no

938
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:07,800
there's a lot of graphs background goes into that to understand these configurations come from

939
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:08,870
the same

940
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,430
you mention there

941
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,460
it has to do

942
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,920
with things like

943
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,300
prime checking this

944
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,960
we can

945
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,200
if fact

946
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,300
in this machine

947
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:28,410
two in the war from mathematica you ask about primes the probabilistic

948
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,630
well some boring

949
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:34,470
the pretty certain

950
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:35,810
that are

951
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:39,910
examples perfectly accurate

952
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:43,410
yes but there is a nagging possibility there

953
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:48,010
this probabilistic prime tracking we could be wrong

954
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:49,830
yes so

955
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,600
i think

956
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,490
the graph that can be true

957
01:01:54,500 --> 01:02:01,090
this is somewhat similar to that we use some kind of man search

958
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,180
in to find things and if we say well

959
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,870
we didn't find anything

960
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:09,920
because the random searches we're a random

961
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:15,000
because i know something about what we're looking for in the article

962
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:15,930
the two

963
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,990
conjecture is

964
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:21,030
and then conductors can

965
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:23,220
given the interesting says

966
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:27,250
with the conjecture holds then a lot of other things after all the

967
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:30,800
but i think we have to be left with the

968
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:37,410
possibility there because there is another version of the conjecture is true but it could

969
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:40,380
be a very interesting method of discovery

970
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:50,250
so this is the first new

971
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,630
in addition to is that the

972
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:08,550
you will be a lot of the people that people have the

973
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,250
the opposite that of humans

974
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:13,660
you must

975
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:17,250
it doesn't

976
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:21,970
this is the case is this

977
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:31,890
however what about the way that this is due to

978
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:34,300
it is solution that

979
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:41,090
or more likely to

980
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:42,420
he is

981
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:48,400
why do you think the it is the world so it is that there is

982
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:58,290
a possibility that you see something about this is not to be extremely complex that

983
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,910
so easy to see

984
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:06,240
six months

985
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:11,180
the mathematics applied to the physical world

986
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:12,930
yes and so

987
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:16,750
that's only based on all kinds of assumptions for example

988
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:22,840
i like to ask people to come in and sit down

989
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:26,040
and is an empty seat next to you may want to slide over a kind

990
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:26,900
of problem with the

991
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,980
the person nearby you so make space for the people

992
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:32,740
so i

993
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:35,290
for those of you who don't know me

994
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:38,430
and william cohen the general chair for the conference this year

995
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:44,420
and general chair of course to get the delegate almost every responsibility

996
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:47,580
either the local organizers who does a fantastic job

997
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:52,110
four to the program chair scientific elements generally so unfortunately can you say

998
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:56,890
and they did great job i get just sort of reserve a few of the

999
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:01,830
prestigious enjoyable activity so i decided to introduce michael

1000
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:06,080
so i don't like all currently known michael for

1001
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,860
i'll be ten or twelve years

1002
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:12,620
so i remember when michael was a graduate student

1003
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:17,850
having a conversation with the point of my colleagues eighteen he labs

1004
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:23,740
ask them what was interesting and exciting and sort of the recent concerts they've been

1005
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:31,220
and everybody mentioned this fantastic results in the computational linguistics community so apparently so

1006
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:35,010
some new graduate student one really heard of on built this

1007
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:40,440
brand new statistical pasture that was very elegant and did better on the treebank data

1008
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:43,510
anybody else it ever done in the history of the world so they were very

1009
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:46,690
impressed with this really trying hard to get that

1010
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:51,250
a graduate student different internship so they were very excited about the possibility which

1011
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:55,580
it's not for the the usual thing you usually excited about that in order for

1012
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:57,050
more than anything else

1013
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:58,990
sorry graduate students

1014
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:05,010
so we are actually very lucky and i remember whether it came as an intern

1015
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:07,820
but a few years later

1016
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:13,410
graduated from the university of pennsylvania device which market

1017
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:15,460
and he came to eighteen t

1018
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:18,440
and i had the pleasure of working with them for a couple of years and

1019
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,180
he immediately jumped in and although

1020
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,990
he came out the computational linguistics community

1021
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:28,570
this clearly immediately you can't contributing in all sorts of interesting ways

1022
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:31,600
so what she might

1023
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:35,970
and he's been working in this intersection of language proc

1024
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,630
for machine learning

1025
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:41,600
basically everything that he said very what is

1026
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:48,600
at eighteen he was part of the civil war i would say sixty people

1027
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:50,230
the people in the lab

1028
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:52,870
b twenty five percent machine learning

1029
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:57,750
michael was honoured in two thousand two in one of the three people in machine

1030
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:00,200
learning that

1031
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:07,790
i believe that i have AIDS and

1032
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:12,730
i give you a slight sense of despair since then

1033
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:18,850
in two thousand two he kind of people would be constant empirical methods in natural

1034
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:20,390
language processing which is

1035
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,340
i actually

1036
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,750
the main

1037
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,060
so are very

1038
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:32,140
in all he was the first one he was or or

1039
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:38,810
especially and you get best paper award in two thousand two young people one thousand

1040
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,540
know you're doing the same thing

1041
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,570
one thousand three

1042
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,290
and to two thousand three he was the

1043
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:51,250
he was the program chair for the middle east so we can use paper what

1044
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,790
people work

1045
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:56,620
but he did it to pay for additional people were two thousand

1046
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,630
in two thousand five

1047
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:03,010
so you have to for a lot of really work

1048
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:05,090
very effective action

1049
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,220
and the the number of

1050
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:08,730
i saw we thanks

1051
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:17,040
so pretty much all the outcome can be talking about today is a joint work

1052
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:21,440
with this group to clear and it goes on to accuse i just wanted to

1053
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,760
acknowledge them first

1054
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:28,220
so structured prediction problem so this can be the topic of today's talk social explain

1055
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,220
what these are

1056
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:34,390
so without considering supervised learning setting setting so as usual goal is to learn a

1057
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:38,750
function from some set x to some set why assume that we have a set

1058
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:41,610
of labelled examples of that desired mapping

1059
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:47,370
OK very well understood problem or very well studied problem at least as binary classification

1060
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:48,650
with a set y

1061
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,330
is simply a set of two possible labels is called minus one plus one

1062
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:58,280
generalisation of binary classification and multiclass classification in this case the set is for k

1063
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:02,050
labels k is generally a fairly small number

1064
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:06,440
so in recent years structured prediction problems have shown

1065
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,870
quite a bit of work in machine learning community

1066
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:13,940
these are the following characteristics of the set y possible labels for any input is

1067
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:16,050
typically very large set

1068
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:21,500
so wasn't not it will grow exponentially fast with the size of the input x

1069
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:23,210
OK so it's a very large set

1070
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:27,820
in addition each member of the set has internal structure

1071
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,730
OK can we can leverage this internal structure in a couple of ways one in

1072
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:34,780
terms of how we represent these objects or labels

1073
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:40,270
and secondly in the algorithms we use in formulating its prediction problems so let me

1074
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:44,010
maybe more concrete to give you some examples of structured prediction problems arise in many

1075
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:47,880
fields here's an example of a speech recognition so

1076
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,240
so the problem is to map an acoustic input

1077
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:55,900
two sentence OK so each label in a sense is an entire sentence in computer

1078
01:09:55,900 --> 01:10:00,570
vision we might want to map images to underlying segmentations for example using a markov

1079
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:02,010
random fields

1080
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:06,240
i will come back to that later when we analyse the running time but there's

1081
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,880
some data structure we're going on here again

1082
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,800
i'm using notation a bit

1083
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,320
OK so here's a graph

1084
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,590
with edge weights

1085
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:52,510
OK and i want my parents here

1086
01:10:54,680 --> 01:11:02,530
animals are going to drop my estimates can you don't cheat

1087
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:08,610
we're going to run the algorithm on this graph as will be

1088
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:12,860
a and one of the shortest path from a to everyone else

1089
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,530
so you can check OK there paths exist

1090
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:18,700
so hopefully everything should end up to a finite value body and all the weights

1091
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:22,110
are nonnegative so this argument should work

1092
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:25,280
in the algorithm doesn't even need can activity but it does need all the weights

1093
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,590
are nonnegative

1094
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:32,110
so we run the algorithm for the initialisation we set the distance estimates for source

1095
01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:35,760
to be zero because in fact there is only one path from a a that's

1096
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:40,720
to do nothing the empty pass i'm going to put a key zero over here

1097
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,700
and for everyone else we're just going to put infinity because we don't know any

1098
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,130
better at this point

1099
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:53,940
so i'll put he's of infinity everyone else

1100
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,840
OK so now you can see

1101
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:59,590
i mean what the algorithm does is extract the minimum from the queue and given

1102
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:03,110
our setup will definitely choose as or in this case

1103
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:07,590
so it has always zero everyone else has a larger quite a bit larger way

1104
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:09,300
OK so we look at s

1105
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,990
four of his here

1106
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:16,240
so we look at a we add a two are set as on square something

1107
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,340
when it it's now removed from the queue will never go back in because we

1108
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:23,200
never had anything to the queue start with all the verses and extracting decrease keys

1109
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,950
but we never answer

1110
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:26,400
so a is gone

1111
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:30,220
OK now i want to update the keys of all of the

1112
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,740
vertices and the claim is i only need to look at the vertices that have

1113
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:36,450
edges from a to z to a to b

1114
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:38,240
and that has way ten

1115
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:41,170
and so i compare well is it a good idea to go from eighty a

1116
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:45,550
which cost nothing and then to go along z a b which cost ten for

1117
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:48,920
seems like a pretty good idea because that has the total weight of surplus ten

1118
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,070
which is ten

1119
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:55,950
which is much more than infinity so not a racist infinity right ten

1120
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:59,820
and over over in the queue as well that's the decrease cooperation

1121
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,630
so now i know a path from a to be good

1122
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:07,030
the only other edge as zero plus three

1123
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:10,130
it is less than infinity so cool put three

1124
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:12,360
here for c

1125
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,900
c is there

1126
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,130
OK the other vertices i don't touch i'm going to rewrite them here but the

1127
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:22,220
algorithm doesn't have to copy them those keys are already there it's just touching the

1128
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:27,030
that was pretty boring now we

1129
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:28,180
look at

1130
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,010
rq and we extract the minimum element so is no longer in there so the

1131
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:33,130
minimum key

1132
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,610
here is three

1133
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:37,970
so the claim is that this is a shortest path from a to c

1134
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:41,240
here is a shortest path from a to c there's no other shorter where you

1135
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:44,150
can check that will prove it in a moment

1136
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:49,380
i call so remove see from the list is gone and then we look at

1137
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:52,650
all of the outgoing edges from c so there is one that goes up to

1138
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:55,090
which has weight for

1139
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:59,670
four plus three which is the shortest path way from a to c grade c

1140
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:03,380
and c to be sure cost three was for which is seven which is less

1141
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:06,740
than ten so we found an even better path to get to be better to

1142
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:09,760
go like this is to go like that

1143
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:14,030
we write seven for b

1144
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:20,220
and there not going to d cost eight three-plus decades is eleven eleven is less

1145
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:26,380
infinity i checked so we write a letter g then we looked at e we

1146
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:27,490
have three

1147
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:30,740
plus two is five which is less than infinity

1148
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,920
so we write five

1149
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:37,070
for the new kiefer at this point we have financial past everywhere

1150
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:38,860
but they may not be the best ones

1151
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,840
so we have to keep looking

1152
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:44,300
OK we just next to the next round of the algorithm we extract the minimum

1153
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:48,090
key among all these can not be which we've seen and probably know the answer

1154
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:52,280
to but it's the he has the smallest key

1155
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:56,070
so we take this we now declared this to be a shortest path all the

1156
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:57,240
way we got to e

1157
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,380
on this path agency

1158
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:01,380
c d e

1159
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:05,630
clear that to be shortest where they were done with e but we still have

1160
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:10,380
to update what about all the outgoing edges from e there's only one here because

1161
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:14,970
five plus nine which is fourteen which is bigger than eleven so

1162
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:19,010
no go that's not an interesting pattern our previous path which would like this in

1163
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:22,780
a cost eleven is better than the one we are considering now drawing the whole

1164
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:26,260
after the album's only adding these two numbers

1165
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,800
OK go

1166
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:31,220
so don't change anything

1167
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:38,050
five is removed or is removed or new keys are seven eleven so we take

1168
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,920
the key seven here

1169
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:46,440
which is for element be vertex p we declare the shortest path we currently have

1170
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:50,130
in our hands from a to b which happens to be this one algorithm can

1171
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:55,450
actually tell this by the way but we're drawing it anyway the the spanish ACB

1172
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,050
is there

1173
01:15:57,050 --> 01:16:01,010
candidate shortest path claims that it is indeed shortest now we look call all the

1174
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:02,820
outgoing edges one that goes back to c

1175
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:07,400
the cost seven plus one which is eight which is bigger than three

1176
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:08,760
which is good

1177
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:13,180
but we are declared seem to be done but the algorithm checks this says that's

1178
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:17,940
not better and then we look at this other end from b to d that

1179
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:21,760
cost plus two which is nine

1180
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:26,880
which is better than less so we in fact have an even shorter path

1181
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,240
so the shortest path weight now d

1182
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:33,970
it is nine because there's this path because a a c b

1183
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:38,470
for total cost of three plus four plus two is not

1184
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:43,400
cornell is only one element in the queue will remove it d

1185
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:48,010
we look at the outgoing edges there is one going here which cost nine percent

1186
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:52,220
which is sixteen which is way bigger than five so we're done

1187
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,220
do anything

1188
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,090
this despite the queue is empty

1189
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,970
and the claim is that all these numbers that are written here the final values

1190
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:01,920
the shortest path weights

1191
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:04,990
this not like five minutes as

1192
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:06,270
and now you need to

1193
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:10,270
really work hard and do some strange things so again i just one

1194
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,420
let you know

1195
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:13,870
these things exist what you do

1196
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:18,790
because you partition the set of worlds into two types some called normal something called

1197
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:23,130
create as you can see that this was not very politically correct in the seventies

1198
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:28,030
that you get away with those terms there but then again normal and non normal

1199
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:33,050
right so creators the natural thing that you might say and the idea of the

1200
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:34,300
create world

1201
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:35,460
is that

1202
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:41,350
every query world has to make diamond phi true for every formula five

1203
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:45,730
that's it that's is requirement so what you do is you build the kripke frames

1204
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:47,510
in a particular way

1205
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:50,290
so that that's always true

1206
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,350
and then what happens is

1207
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:55,740
getting no longer make every voxel military

1208
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,260
OK because from every world you will always be able to see

1209
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:03,440
and and that something is actually an inconsistent world

1210
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:05,670
i don't want to go into the details but

1211
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,150
it allows you to break necessitation

1212
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,320
so you get weaker logics

1213
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:14,490
these are found some applications in computer science

1214
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:17,870
because in computer science and artificial intelligence

1215
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:19,810
i want to talk about

1216
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,490
box five they want to interpret box five as something like

1217
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:26,590
you know the agent knows

1218
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,120
what the agent believes five

1219
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,100
if you have necessitation

1220
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:37,980
right was station

1221
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:40,420
by five those two box five

1222
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:42,010
from guam

1223
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:48,340
then in this situation what you're saying is that the agent has perfect

1224
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:52,880
deducibility power but if it can deduce gamma

1225
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:56,390
then it can then it knows and believes all the things

1226
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:59,310
they it can deduce of course we know that

1227
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,600
agents don't have perfect conductors

1228
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:04,430
look dropping this

1229
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:08,100
and replacing it with that we corrects him

1230
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,780
now here we go back and say well right there with the shapes that we

1231
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:19,260
they were the first order conditions like your reflexivity

1232
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:20,990
which we couldn't

1233
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:22,620
find the shape for

1234
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,610
so that was the gap

1235
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:25,940
where the

1236
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:27,620
cricket e

1237
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:30,130
semantics but the first order conditions

1238
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:33,830
i wasn't able to be captured by shape so how do we close the gap

1239
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,740
people look

1240
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:38,610
nominal tense logics and there's a whole area

1241
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,820
of these now which is called hybrid logic

1242
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:48,100
type hybrid logic into google and there should be a conference called highlights which is

1243
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:49,950
associated with this area

1244
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:51,860
what's the difference

1245
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,160
all that i'm doing

1246
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,820
is i'm any an extra set of atomic formulae

1247
01:19:56,860 --> 01:20:01,080
called i know up to i one and i allowed me to be intermingled with

1248
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,140
the formula on the left to build formula with

1249
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:09,130
OK so what am i doing and saying

1250
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:10,470
he is my

1251
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:15,860
well w nor his mind the world w on his my world w two

1252
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:17,350
and i have my

1253
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:20,990
assignment of pain or p one

1254
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,690
and p two that are

1255
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:30,320
that's the traditional assignment and we can assign true and false arbitrarily

1256
01:20:30,370 --> 01:20:35,010
what you also do is you say well i'm also going to assign values to

1257
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:44,570
i know i want and i two which is a disjoint set of atomic formulae

1258
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:49,330
i have a global condition

1259
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:51,780
the global condition is that

1260
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:52,670
this guy

1261
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:56,390
is allowed to be given the value true

1262
01:20:56,410 --> 01:20:59,510
and only one world

1263
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:00,560
right so

1264
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:03,070
this guy is true here

1265
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,420
now it may also be in that this disguise tree that's OK as long as

1266
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:08,940
it's not true or anywhere else

1267
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:10,110
and then

1268
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:13,810
now we can't have these two guys tree here so maybe this guy is true

1269
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:19,370
and over here maybe it's something out here

1270
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:21,860
can you see that

1271
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:27,670
i not being true tells us that we're at w two

1272
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:32,460
in know language you now formula language we are now able to talk about being

1273
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,120
at the point

1274
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:36,850
in the old days remember

1275
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:39,380
the itemset here

1276
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:41,370
in the syntax

1277
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:44,630
and the world set here in the semantic

1278
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,260
OK what these normals do is they allow you to bring the names of the

1279
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:51,610
world back into the syntax

1280
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:53,040
and now i claim

1281
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:54,160
after this

1282
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:57,410
captures the reflexivity the shape

1283
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:59,870
let's just see why

1284
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,420
so i suppose

1285
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:07,870
that a particular i say i'm let's make it

1286
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:12,220
whatever this one was let's make it i three showing let's say this is i

1287
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:16,710
so i three is true at w no

1288
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,740
what the shapes is is that

1289
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:22,570
you're not allowed to have a diamond i true here

1290
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:30,570
so what is time and i said well diamond i can go some way

1291
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:34,080
and where i end up i have to say the same i is where i

1292
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:37,620
started i have to have i three true

1293
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:40,950
if i go anywhere else i three is not going to be true because i

1294
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:43,350
three is only true at this point

1295
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:46,130
so the time and i see is

1296
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:49,840
this error has to go back to itself

1297
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,760
and if you say that can hold

1298
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:56,090
then you saying that you can't have managed to yourself

1299
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:00,870
this is true one particular world and whether that's true

1300
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:02,470
it's not the case

1301
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:05,430
that you can see your world which makes it true

1302
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:10,360
there's only one world series i tree is sitting in his you can't see yourself

1303
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,910
and these are a bit more complicated

1304
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:14,720
i'll let you that

1305
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:19,760
all right

1306
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:23,910
any questions about everything that we've done

1307
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:27,050
because this is now

1308
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:28,760
the end of

1309
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:33,090
the semantics and calculating terms of hilbert calculi and i want to get on to

1310
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:35,160
another of calculate

1311
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:36,680
call tableau calculi

1312
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:39,970
which are useful for automated reasoning

1313
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:42,160
the questions

1314
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:43,850
something that not

1315
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:46,360
clear about correspondence theory

1316
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:48,150
so was

1317
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:56,010
it gets nasty very quickly

1318
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,100
OK so

1319
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:01,150
basic nominal tense logic is decidable

1320
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:04,930
once you start adding any sort of operators that allow you to say well i

1321
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:06,360
can go somewhere else

1322
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:09,120
so they have operators like

1323
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:16,070
seven operators like an operator at i five

1324
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,740
right what it says is

1325
01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:21,070
i'm somewhere i don't know where i am or what i do know is that

1326
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:23,990
the world i five street

1327
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:27,520
OK and then have another one called down which says

1328
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:33,530
take me to the world where i string

1329
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:36,200
i based on shadows

1330
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:37,740
based on a fraction

1331
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:39,080
based on reflection

1332
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,770
a lot has no legs

1333
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,630
it's purely based on matrix

1334
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,680
there are single general i designed compound design

1335
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:50,470
and the human eye is

1336
01:24:50,490 --> 01:24:51,930
in this small car

1337
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:56,550
and cameras are basically mimicking this particular optical configuration

1338
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:58,720
so this whole space to explore

1339
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:03,670
and each of them must task specific and feature

1340
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,680
well because of the thinking about all this

1341
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,240
issues of

1342
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,590
land system optics and flash and so on

1343
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:13,950
if you go back and ask the consumer

1344
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:17,220
there going saying what i really don't care about that

1345
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,840
just give me a camera

1346
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:21,510
that's just a big black box

1347
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:24,130
with a big red part

1348
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:26,570
nor lands no flash

1349
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:27,360
and also

1350
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,860
not censored

1351
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,260
that's all i want

1352
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:32,380
and when i press the red button

1353
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,260
you know if i'm if i'm in in front of

1354
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,610
i for power

1355
01:25:36,610 --> 01:25:38,300
you know i do

1356
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,220
therefore with my own camera

1357
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:42,490
because if i have device like this

1358
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:46,800
despite the loss of but also the back

1359
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:48,430
it just goes on flickr

1360
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:49,930
and trolls

1361
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:53,950
for my current GPS coordinates which is in front of the our roughly in the

1362
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:58,630
same direction is roughly the same time of day after the same season and brings

1363
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:02,130
me back from the border from flickr which is taken by some other guy with

1364
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:04,090
fancy camera with a lot of time

1365
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:08,780
and bring it back to me so despite all this great what we're doing

1366
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,450
all the consumer wants

1367
01:26:11,550 --> 01:26:14,400
it's just a blind camera it's really disappointing

1368
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,610
thank you

1369
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:32,430
any questions

1370
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:41,880
so you use those coding techniques to take

1371
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:49,800
are you already discuss with people from MIT lincoln lab for instance works on redound

1372
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:51,410
this configurations

1373
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:55,280
the principle this conclusion is that there

1374
01:26:55,300 --> 01:27:00,700
so define many cuts many the first according to optimize

1375
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:05,780
structure function you have already with

1376
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:07,910
OK i'm not i'm not

1377
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:12,410
as you are in boston you can also with rest

1378
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:17,380
you know very well going to be for radar applications

1379
01:27:17,530 --> 01:27:26,630
for this competition for i in range with solutions are also refer reprocessing

1380
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:30,200
and i agree with you i think optics as we know very well is the

1381
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,490
workers in

1382
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:34,220
lots of other foods especially telecommunications

1383
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:39,510
and so on the optics is almost thirty forty years behind all fees and i

1384
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:44,400
would say photography is even more far behind from the rest of the scientific image

1385
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,570
so what's happening in this field now

1386
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:53,840
islam of the ideas that were explored in signal processing and different analysis and so

1387
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,780
on that was

1388
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,740
that was done in other fields is slowly filtering down

1389
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:05,260
two something that can be done at optical wavelengths of devices that are

1390
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:10,050
that portable and so on so you know where there's a lot of beautiful research

1391
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:14,180
a lot of beautiful literature available as well

1392
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:20,070
for example the notion of core temperature is very very well known in astronomy since

1393
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:23,130
the sixties and seventies and and only now

1394
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:25,070
it's possible to think about that

1395
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:30,160
all we

1396
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:38,080
and if you use

1397
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:56,610
this is right

1398
01:29:01,490 --> 01:29:04,710
he only

1399
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:08,810
number of people

1400
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:53,200
one year

1401
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:07,670
you will not

1402
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:11,700
the world

1403
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:20,540
o thing

1404
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:58,110
here are the ones who want

1405
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:00,930
so even if you

1406
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:02,920
o in

1407
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:09,570
he also

1408
01:32:15,650 --> 01:32:19,100
he or

1409
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:32,700
in this way

1410
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,490
there is one

1411
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:47,270
that's all i j

1412
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:48,820
okay let's not limited to

1413
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:49,910
reasoning are gonna have

1414
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:53,510
with but that's a nice suggestions or any other suggestions

1415
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:55,470
and then we will have a think about

1416
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:58,080
probabilities in due course

1417
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:05,800
how many of

1418
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:16,360
to everyone right

1419
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:18,780
on one side and then

1420
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:26,880
and like okay

1421
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:34,200
around so in this case we are leaving on the table a possible life and four possibly

1422
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:39,170
and you're suggesting leaving both lights on the table

1423
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:41,400
how long will be the goods

1424
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:50,300
so that's a nice suggestions let's now have i think about them and think about the possible

1425
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:52,170
things that's good

1426
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:57,380
if we went over this strategy

1427
01:33:57,870 --> 01:33:58,590
as a second way

1428
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,420
well it builds on one side and all the possible relied on our

1429
01:34:03,950 --> 01:34:04,840
what could happen

1430
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,770
could it looked like that's

1431
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:11,240
could happen

1432
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,740
could the right hand side go down

1433
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:21,660
why not

1434
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,930
so this is the possibly live

1435
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:39,550
and anyway that's i could go down given the left hand

1436
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,380
although good is it

1437
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:42,620
one of his followers

1438
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:45,660
notable and heavy but really no that's not

1439
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:50,640
possible these guys can only be available in light so this has probability zero

1440
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:55,690
is it possible like a balance

1441
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:02,290
is one heavy possibly have you guys

1442
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:04,330
what's the probability that being the case

1443
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:08,640
what's the probability of

1444
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,130
that's happening

1445
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:18,150
so that's the probability distribution whose entropy is

1446
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:19,750
one day

1447
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:22,910
okay let's talk through

1448
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:24,090
this one here

1449
01:35:40,970 --> 01:35:42,650
it's an asymmetric situation and

1450
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:46,880
talk about the symmetric outcome was the probability

1451
01:35:47,490 --> 01:35:48,430
now that balancing

1452
01:36:00,850 --> 01:36:02,910
because if you to

1453
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:04,280
then for balance

1454
01:36:09,390 --> 01:36:10,280
by symmetry

1455
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:12,370
the remaining probability has to be

1456
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:15,160
split between nodes are happy with the symmetry argument

1457
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,050
for example

1458
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:22,300
this could happen

1459
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:25,680
this guy is available

1460
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,070
and is therefore lighter than normal

1461
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:32,100
if only even does is

1462
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:34,490
and the heavy

1463
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:38,050
so that's the

1464
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:42,530
action and the probability distribution

1465
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:43,910
and action

1466
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:47,490
we could

1467
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,530
three good three lights

1468
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:55,010
so what's the probability that this will

1469
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:10,160
this because as far as we all balls

1470
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:13,640
but we've left on the table and if any of them is doable

1471
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:14,870
and it's balance

1472
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:17,850
what's the probability that's

1473
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:19,490
he will be

1474
01:37:23,490 --> 01:37:25,070
down on left hand up on the right

1475
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:35,010
what's hot climates

1476
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:38,030
is the

1477
01:37:39,070 --> 01:37:41,010
zero probability of getting this

1478
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:42,740
come here

1479
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:47,370
the cos there's no way that they possibly like i can be heavier

1480
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:48,240
and the good

1481
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:54,140
right so that a whole bunch a possible thing can do and everyone misleading to

1482
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:58,930
a different probability distribution is one probability distribution

1483
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:00,470
is another

1484
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:03,220
and this one

1485
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:04,720
the that's me

1486
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:08,140
that's is actually a little less than one that's

1487
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:15,410
this one has entropy

1488
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:17,600
one that

1489
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:21,350
and i wonder if i can dig out

1490
01:38:23,010 --> 01:38:23,600
what it is

1491
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:26,570
one of and

1492
01:38:26,570 --> 01:38:30,370
simply using this permission

1493
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:37,830
in general if you know that you have one can you

1494
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,880
there are also a rule that allows you to co-star can from or they can

1495
01:38:41,890 --> 01:38:46,730
for example you gave can and alpha is the first then you know that i

1496
01:38:46,730 --> 01:38:52,840
fucking keep last time also can or if you have to learn to some of

1497
01:38:52,850 --> 01:38:55,800
the candidates is that you can learn the product of the camera

1498
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:59,640
he sought to catch

1499
01:38:59,650 --> 01:39:05,870
i show you some application where support vector machine has been important for you

1500
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:11,150
i would say one of the application that

1501
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:14,950
well the support vector machine has been

1502
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,430
widely recognised as

1503
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:19,700
good means the is

1504
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:22,550
it is optical character recognition

1505
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:29,490
it is that it's nice that contains sixty thousand training samples and ten thousand test

1506
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:34,190
there are images and that is to recognise the on

1507
01:39:34,210 --> 01:39:37,150
and the people use their own pizza

1508
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:41,730
and also some preprocessing on the menu

1509
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:48,320
four like in two thousand two the course and short course show that we of

1510
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:53,790
water can they can reach very good performance that has been for years state of

1511
01:39:53,790 --> 01:39:55,650
the art on benchmark

1512
01:39:57,190 --> 01:40:03,880
like and they try for linear SVM and they got this eight percent the polynomials

1513
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:05,900
can and they got

1514
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:08,980
one percent then they say

1515
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:11,390
which is something that we

1516
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:18,220
we designed cannot taking into account their translations of the pixel

1517
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:19,170
and they

1518
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:22,850
do that and they got an improvement of

1519
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:23,720
i think now

1520
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:28,480
not the best result on these datasets but close to

1521
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:31,800
the best result and it is one of the applications made

1522
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,160
and i guess you

1523
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,200
they want to

1524
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:42,600
face detection

1525
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:44,110
by was one

1526
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:49,720
the consumer faces different schemes and they decide

1527
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:55,450
nineteen times nineteen eighty so they do some preprocessing on the images and

1528
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:58,630
the classifier with SVM

1529
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:02,680
with polynomial kernel fifty thousand at point

1530
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:06,380
this is one of the first them to apply

1531
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:12,510
so i support vector machine to computer vision fifty thousand at the point is not

1532
01:41:12,510 --> 01:41:15,730
that much but at that time was

1533
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:19,330
quite kind of the results

1534
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:24,410
in fact the support vector machine has been using computer vision for many other applications

1535
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:25,960
and i would say

1536
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:32,660
this is after resulting pedestrian detection of being the support vector machine

1537
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:39,460
we clever features that are used for the guardian proposed by the police

1538
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:43,830
by a simple linear can they get very good results but

1539
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:51,430
my classifier in and student proposal is the gram intersection can therefore

1540
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:54,070
this kind of the k

1541
01:41:54,070 --> 01:41:57,130
they have more to scale representation of the data

1542
01:41:57,140 --> 01:41:58,180
and they

1543
01:41:58,190 --> 01:41:59,850
i got a very

1544
01:41:59,850 --> 01:42:01,730
good results with respect to

1545
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:03,700
that the sunday

1546
01:42:03,710 --> 01:42:05,520
he said the

1547
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:12,730
they also provide a faster way to compute the again because

1548
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:18,370
usually you can allow the linear support vector machine widely used because they are fast

1549
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:20,180
to train nineteen

1550
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:24,490
the machine i'm not that fast so if you want to use it and you

1551
01:42:24,490 --> 01:42:27,840
want to be able to scale with a lot of you have to have some

1552
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:33,840
and i think in this paper and i think to compute the disease

1553
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:37,790
intersection can be proposed

1554
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:41,100
another application is the

1555
01:42:41,430 --> 01:42:44,800
i mean match by ground

1556
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:52,620
the context is object category recognition feature that uses scale invariant feature

1557
01:42:52,630 --> 01:42:53,440
this is

1558
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:56,320
kind of

1559
01:42:56,330 --> 01:43:00,020
or maybe about these ideas have been used by

1560
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:05,130
many by many more or and also

1561
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:10,330
they propose a fast evaluation of these can function and they go to very good

1562
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:13,860
results on the dataset

1563
01:43:15,190 --> 01:43:19,030
he then in the example shown before

1564
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:21,150
and that were some knowledge

1565
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:25,780
about the application domain give assistance in defining

1566
01:43:25,910 --> 01:43:28,100
april similarity measure

1567
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:32,040
but in many application we don't have a clue to the signing to choose the

1568
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:36,440
can so as i told you before the first of all like i ocean putting

1569
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:43,180
on her getting but very often you need to design something that even if you

1570
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:45,900
use a simple solution can

1571
01:43:45,950 --> 01:43:50,960
you are required to choose the value for the we don't look at the results

1572
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:54,140
of the regularisation parameter that you need to say so

1573
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:57,990
or you could also cause evaluation validation or you

1574
01:43:58,010 --> 01:44:00,750
make some doubt as validation set

1575
01:44:00,770 --> 01:44:09,900
otherwise very difficult to to this but i mean without regularly knowledge

1576
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:15,380
i want to show you that this is very important and adds the model selection

1577
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:20,750
it's really quality of it's very important to make something work

1578
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:23,590
that is not say that

1579
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:28,570
very family KTH dataset for action classification

1580
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:34,710
the united states in one of two thousand seven one two thousand five that they

1581
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:40,480
use exactly the same feature exactly the same game but in the end

1582
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:41,520
when i was in

1583
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:47,140
t and i think that factors what should well you know the people by

1584
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:50,660
some really knowledge and you can see

1585
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:55,480
he performance like the two point five per cent

1586
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:58,460
o point five percent simply

1587
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:01,460
being able to do and i suppose we should so i

1588
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:04,990
it's so time-consuming but i think it's really

1589
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:10,900
so if you want to know what selection so in the end the choice of

1590
01:45:10,910 --> 01:45:15,670
the so it's important to people started to

1591
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:17,200
to think

1592
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:19,430
OK can we do something that

1593
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:22,360
can we let the cat

1594
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:23,720
together with

1595
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:26,250
learning our economy

1596
01:45:26,290 --> 01:45:29,620
i think that the first world came into being

1597
01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:30,630
done by

1598
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:34,320
in two thousand two and this has been by

1599
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:42,190
pioneering work from the manual approach has been proposed for learning can occur chemical combination

1600
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:45,670
i think it's quite nice idea

1601
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:52,320
what do we would do they do is the following they they can as matrix

1602
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:57,110
and they considered as the same thing so they have some because the label at

1603
01:45:57,110 --> 01:46:01,920
the top of the training set up and funded living that the that's the

1604
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:05,840
let's assume for now that we have just the training center so does the labelled

1605
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,840
and data two

1606
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:12,190
two lambda divided by age and so on that's where you find

1607
01:46:12,190 --> 01:46:13,490
you're minimum

1608
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:15,300
and if you convert that into

1609
01:46:16,270 --> 01:46:18,520
where they actually fall on the screen

1610
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:20,120
well the next one

1611
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:20,920
it will be

1612
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:23,270
the small angle approximations l

1613
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:24,270
times lambda

1614
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:25,600
divided by a

1615
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:28,880
that's no different

1616
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:30,320
so now what i o u

1617
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:31,270
it is

1618
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:35,150
the pattern what will depend on like when i look on the screen they will

1619
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:36,650
i really seem

1620
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:40,710
well it's looking is going to look very different from what you may think of

1621
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:44,030
applying now in terms of x i could have thought of it in terms of

1622
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:47,820
i decided to plotted in terms of x

1623
01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:49,270
so here

1624
01:46:49,270 --> 01:46:50,930
x equals zero

1625
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:52,210
there is

1626
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:55,820
one mistake able on negotiable is the maximum that's

1627
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:58,770
they coincide with theta equals zero

1628
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,490
and then here

1629
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:01,740
and land that

1630
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,910
divided by

1631
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:09,380
completely destructive interference that's that angle theta one

1632
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,770
at times l

1633
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:12,440
and then here

1634
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,550
two lambda

1635
01:47:14,570 --> 01:47:16,200
divided by a

1636
01:47:17,380 --> 01:47:22,020
destructive interference and the same is true of course on the other side

1637
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,410
and what you're going to see now in terms of

1638
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:29,050
intensity that i showed you there was a square metres is the curve that looks

1639
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:30,690
like this

1640
01:47:32,270 --> 01:47:34,690
broad maximum

1641
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:36,630
absolutely zero here

1642
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:40,270
very small maximum absolutely zero there

1643
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:46,160
very small maximum and zero there and this continues for a long time

1644
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:49,530
and this is very different from anything we've seen with multiple

1645
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:53,980
if the intensity here is i zero

1646
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:57,880
then the maximum here which i didn't even calculate where it is it is somewhere

1647
01:47:57,880 --> 01:47:59,680
in between these two minima

1648
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:02,000
but i didn't calculate precisely where this

1649
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:04,020
the maximum is very low

1650
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:06,490
is only four point five percent

1651
01:48:06,490 --> 01:48:07,750
in strength

1652
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:11,650
one of my zero and this is even lower this is only one point six

1653
01:48:12,730 --> 01:48:14,630
of i zero

1654
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:18,580
so when you look at a diffraction pattern we call this the diffraction pattern like

1655
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:20,350
this you'll see a very

1656
01:48:20,370 --> 01:48:22,880
broad sense maximum

1657
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:23,850
and then you see

1658
01:48:23,870 --> 01:48:26,510
the dark spots on the site

1659
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:32,050
you see light coming up again in between the sort of sup maximum

1660
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:36,330
and so the weights of this center maximum

1661
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:37,520
this is where it

1662
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:39,230
which is really

1663
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:41,470
x one

1664
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:45,780
which is then l and divided by eight

1665
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:49,100
and if you want to be picky you say well this centre maximum really twice

1666
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:53,670
that much fun be my guest but this is clearly a measure for how wide

1667
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:55,780
the center spot will be

1668
01:48:55,790 --> 01:48:59,260
when you see it on a screen

1669
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:04,420
and now come something that is completely nonintuitive for you as well as for me

1670
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:05,350
and that is

1671
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:08,620
if you make a very small

1672
01:49:08,630 --> 01:49:13,270
that means that the lights go for an extremely narrow slit

1673
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:14,970
then this is

1674
01:49:15,010 --> 01:49:16,490
what you see on the wall

1675
01:49:16,510 --> 01:49:18,330
extremely wide

1676
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:19,990
the small it is

1677
01:49:19,990 --> 01:49:23,800
the wide it will be exactly opposed to what you would predict you would think

1678
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:25,160
if you make

1679
01:49:25,210 --> 01:49:27,630
the opening through which put like very small

1680
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:30,910
you would think that what you see on the screen is also very small it's

1681
01:49:30,910 --> 01:49:32,460
exactly the opposite

1682
01:49:32,510 --> 01:49:34,960
and this what i want to demonstrate to you

1683
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:36,590
i have here

1684
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:40,710
demonstration which variables that i can very a

1685
01:49:40,710 --> 01:49:42,920
and we will use

1686
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,040
the brightest

1687
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:45,660
they so that we have

1688
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:50,900
a beam of green laser lights five thousand four hundred angstroms

1689
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:56,020
and what i will do is i will make this opening never never never

1690
01:49:56,220 --> 01:50:00,240
and as i make the opening i start very large start with a large opening

1691
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:01,840
of maybe five millimeters

1692
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:03,730
and large opening

1693
01:50:03,770 --> 01:50:05,300
n is so large

1694
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:06,740
that this

1695
01:50:06,750 --> 01:50:10,660
is negligibly small because a is very large then this is not very large is

1696
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:15,740
very small but as i make a smaller and smaller and and smaller and smaller

1697
01:50:15,770 --> 01:50:18,380
there comes the time that the diffraction with

1698
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,570
it's going to be dominating the whole scene

1699
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:24,040
and what you will see them on the screen there that the

1700
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:28,450
bright spot will get wider and wider wider wider

1701
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:33,860
and that for me is always so enormously fascinating because it goes so strongly against

1702
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:35,480
our intuition

1703
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:37,200
so this is what i

1704
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:39,100
next on the menu

1705
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:40,590
i have here this

1706
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:44,980
so it's i must make sure that i

1707
01:50:45,010 --> 01:50:46,070
i have my

1708
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:49,440
and i'll turn on this

1709
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:50,980
laser that i really

1710
01:50:50,990 --> 01:50:53,400
i accidentally turned on

1711
01:50:53,420 --> 01:50:58,110
i hope is coming on the as it is

1712
01:50:58,270 --> 01:51:00,200
and so you see there

1713
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:02,410
this list is not very white

1714
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:06,040
and so the size of that so that you see there

1715
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:09,770
the size of the of the bright spot is now entirely dictated

1716
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:13,360
by the divergence of my laser beam

1717
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:15,170
the fraction with

1718
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:18,370
is negligibly small because a is very large

1719
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:21,440
now what's now i'm going to

1720
01:51:22,410 --> 01:51:24,760
make a small

1721
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,510
i'm doing that now

1722
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:30,150
making it smaller and and smaller the faction which is still
