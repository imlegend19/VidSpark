1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
the first two

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,960
all to it

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,540
kind of my name

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,710
in one thing all a document

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:20,370
you will of course these all these men to one identity is bill clinton

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,150
because then you have one

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,720
guide and you can do to my

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,630
this is what this guy

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,700
we have

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,480
seventy percent of occupancy levels

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,420
there but it's not

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,670
the company

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:50,800
so you have a different and people like OK multiple alignment in the corporation

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,520
you want to detect what is the relation between these

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,790
they are completely when you have completed their

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,180
previously announced

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:12,780
completed marriage you you could you would know what's what is the relation between

18
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,430
and then

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,310
the fact that the number of that which is quite popular so if you have

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,690
any news or if you want to know

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,630
if they are about things so again you can use the information together make it

22
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,800
into the and some minor

23
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,370
for instance

24
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,070
so here

25
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,970
microsoft wanted to combine

26
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:48,210
the offer by how we are doing the right

27
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,700
we're not ready to be

28
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,080
it's not for me

29
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,420
it could be important we can take

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,570
we might all the information on

31
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:22,840
classification of these we might be able to like for me

32
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,630
we might

33
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:33,540
so you can look because we could expect no which is

34
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,100
but the the

35
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:44,280
declining job of which is not explicitly stated in the metric because they were not

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,650
it's not actually a you will

37
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,050
we could extract

38
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,800
santa that's also quite popular fields information extraction

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,440
we're going to be little playing one game

40
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:05,430
so that you can extract that live in the sense that maybe the

41
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:14,060
also we come the because language quite this but to extract the positive sentiment with

42
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,840
got to his car

43
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,660
what car

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,570
so this might be

45
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:26,670
in especially for marketing for people who want to create the blocks the web

46
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,930
to see what what others

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,930
on the the tenth grand on the system

48
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,750
so the problem but it may be on a certain politicians

49
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,260
that you want to my

50
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,220
so the

51
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:46,810
the book

52
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,210
four morning as i that you can

53
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,180
do you know how to fix them

54
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,520
i'm looking for a medical doctor might be of

55
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,910
in one of the web one

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,990
my e-mails availability of road

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,760
you want to my first opinion

58
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,360
you want to mine scientific data from publications so there are lots and lots of

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,950
applications meals in the whole chapter

60
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,570
remember no

61
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,790
o bank

62
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,470
information retrieval we have a tendency to look a lot like

63
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,230
but actually we have these other sources we have also according to english sources

64
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,260
people do the same thing as we do in

65
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,310
so actually for information retrieval is very important that

66
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:54,150
so we talked quite a bit about different

67
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,400
markov random field problems yesterday and the idea was

68
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,890
first of all to persuade you that markov random fields are

69
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:07,380
somewhat common currency in vision problems and i really do

70
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,790
cover number of the

71
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,340
the big problems

72
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,820
and secondly

73
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,250
just to give you some idea of the details of what

74
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,570
these models might look like these are some of the simpler

75
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,360
versions of the models

76
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,530
but today

77
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,290
it's all going to be about

78
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,540
optimizing those entities that is finding minimum energy is

79
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,140
under two different

80
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,120
kinds of assumptions one is four

81
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,540
before the break of binary problems so problems where all of those

82
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,000
values take the value zero or one as in the foreground background separation

83
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,440
and then after the mini-break we'll talk about

84
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:58,440
the doing the same thing using a similar mechanism to solve integer valued problems

85
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,710
so for example

86
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,270
solving stereo vision we want integer value

87
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,080
optimisation because the disparities are integers

88
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,070
the disparity sitting on each node x

89
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,860
except all the x and say takes an integer value

90
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,190
OK so let's think about this

91
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,540
is the situation this is the

92
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,460
form of energy function which we

93
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,360
i see a few times now

94
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,490
the k and k primes are

95
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,080
pairs of adjacent pixels

96
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,160
and we define ahead of time what

97
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,820
pairs of pixels will be

98
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,850
regarded as neighbours for the purposes of this adjacency

99
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,100
in terms of graphical models which

100
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,050
i suppose you must be

101
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,520
very familiar with

102
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,020
we can write this energy function here

103
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,420
all the in five probability distribution in this form here the

104
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,300
the unobserved variables x

105
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,390
xk is that we want to infer and here are the observations and as usual

106
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,280
the graph runs backwards from the unobserved to the observed but inference runs the other

107
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,210
way how to use the graphical models

108
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,980
so we want to do this optimisation

109
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,740
in order to do that the graph cut methods

110
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,360
constructs a different kind of graph

111
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,710
which will represent

112
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,680
the same energy function but in a different way

113
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,730
so now

114
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,490
the nodes

115
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:37,270
on the the xk nodes appear explicitly on the graph is these orange notice here

116
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,170
the zk is not appearing exactly where they going to

117
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,770
there are two new nodes the source and the sink

118
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:52,190
you can think of this OK and every every xk no here is attached to

119
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,960
the source and sink

120
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,400
and also is attached to its neighbors

121
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,120
as in the definition of neighbourliness

122
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,120
we were talking about here

123
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,050
so i i drawn everything

124
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,120
played by

125
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,080
this set of orange

126
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,950
notes here could itself be two-dimensional two-dimensional coming out of the borders were so you

127
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:20,590
got to play in nodes interconnected according to the neighbour neighbour properties and then all

128
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,800
of those nodes connected up here to the source and down here to the sink

129
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,780
so now

130
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,340
we can to think of

131
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,370
he is in terms of forcing flow through the network and the loan originator not

132
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,360
surprisingly the source and gets back down to the same here

133
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,400
but it's not quite clear why we're talking about flow

134
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,530
so let me first of all talk about cuts

135
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,860
the red

136
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,860
because here is the cut which separates all the nodes in the graph into those

137
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,780
that are connected to the source and those that are connected to the sink

138
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,080
supposing i cut this edge here the graph

139
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,590
so what does it associates

140
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,420
the node to the k no with the sink

141
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:15,840
which is sort of synonymous with the value x equals zero because remember with doing

142
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,190
binary optimisation here all the actors values zero or one so the convention is that

143
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,900
when a node is associated with the sink sink it has that means it has

144
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,380
binary value x equals zero well the cost

145
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:36,870
making that association by definition is f sup k of zero

146
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,400
in other words have some k applied to xk equal zero and zk

147
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,330
so the zk is

148
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,440
i have been dropped from the graph here because there now

149
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,940
implicit in this

150
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,570
k function we think of this as k functions being just the function of

151
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,410
vx case because there's a case to fix that all happened zk nothing more sinister

152
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,530
than that

153
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,580
so now

154
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,500
so it's a it's a associating this note here with the single thinking about having

155
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,270
the value k equal zero

156
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,750
we incur the cost of cutting this

157
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,950
eight years the cost of this age here has to be fk of zero

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,620
so things are going to swap sides even though the sink is on this site

159
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,020
this age has the called edge cost typical zero and this page has an edge

160
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,770
cost skr one

161
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,390
and so now

162
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,400
possible energy this e here for evaluated for particular configuration x is simply

163
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,640
the total cost of edges

164
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,650
by the by the cut

165
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,890
a couple the cut line here so in following the cut line we accumulate

166
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,340
a whole lot of

167
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,220
FK costs which are appropriate to the assignment of particular note to the single but

168
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,010
we also accumulate

169
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,080
cost so the the gk is

170
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,150
this a little bit

171
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,880
texting isn't it because the geek's are actually two by two table

172
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:14,270
because the UK is a function of x kxk prime rather the function x kxk

173
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,770
prime so there should be distributed by two table you shouldn't because there are two

174
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,420
possible values of x k two possible values a prime

175
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,460
and yet i'm proposing to put just one value

176
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,450
on this horizontal

177
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,580
how on did two by two table

178
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,900
of costs get collapsed on two

179
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,410
a single value

180
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,320
well here's how it happened

181
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,410
first of all

182
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,510
we are going to make the

183
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,130
if you like the off diagonal values of g

184
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,330
with zero one one zero

185
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,010
we're going to make them equal for the time being i might retract this later

186
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,150
but the time being i will say they're going to be equal so this is

187
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,440
simply the cost of taking two adjacent nodes and giving them different labelings doesn't matter

188
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,460
which way around the different they'll

189
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,100
now out get the same penalty

190
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,750
but that being different

191
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,890
g one one g of zero zero have nowhere to go

192
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,900
doesn't seem to be any way to put them on this graph so the convention

193
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,660
we're going to need is that they are zero and we'll see that that

194
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,310
can be true without loss of generality

195
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,860
say what

196
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,870
you get five that's about what might be an image

197
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,630
you have this in the spotlight yesterday

198
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,300
this one point two million training images so this is the first series of tasks

199
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,660
in which we had big enough data sets for neural nets reach

200
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,830
and it's the first time we have fast enough computers to train

201
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,310
many the best computer vision to try this

202
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,960
and the results look like this

203
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,270
the error rates

204
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,620
predicting the label correctly in your top five but

205
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,820
they all cluster around twenty six twenty seven percent

206
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,320
the some other people who are pretty good but not quite as good as his best systems

207
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,860
and then if you look at what you get with a neural net with dropout

208
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,470
you get

209
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,290
this is an analog representation

210
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,130
you do a whole lot better

211
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,640
and actually if you give some more training data you get at fifteen percent

212
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,550
so this meant that is very happy with more training data these methods a lots

213
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,670
of hand-engineering if you look at the descriptions of these methods the pages and pages

214
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,400
if you look at the script this meant that we use to denote the dropped

215
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,080
that's a bit unfair because actually the description of this methods is we use every

216
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,100
trick that yan invented over the last twenty years plus dropout

217
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,730
every three billion invention in the last twenty years

218
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,070
plus to be used again about hear

219
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,280
and then drop it gets to the last few percent

220
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,820
so drop is probably worth about three or four percent on this but that's still a lot

221
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,570
here's a better way to think about dropout

222
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,870
one going much too fast like can but also for the end of his i

223
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,520
could even tell my joke about tursunov ski and

224
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,740
here's a better way to think about dropout

225
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,220
if a hidden unit knows which other hidden is can be president

226
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,930
it can cut down to it and if you think back propagation is doing

227
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:18,100
is pushing it's trying to make each hidden unit fix up the mess that is

228
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,540
left over from the other the hidden units

229
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,720
the small this if you're doing regression

230
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,430
where basically you take what all you other hidden units will make the answer be

231
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,920
if you look at the difference from the target

232
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,810
and that's how you change the weights this hidden units so everybody's trying to fix

233
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,390
up the mess left over by everybody else

234
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,630
and that's a guarantee way to avoid overfit

235
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,080
what's happening when you do drop out is you're saying i don't know i'm gonna

236
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,030
have to collaborate with is gonna be some random subset the other these other guys

237
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,230
so i don't know what mess they can leave over

238
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,940
now if in general they leave a mess in one direction of exatt up

239
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,690
but i bet do something that is individually useful

240
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,500
and particularly in classification but means that individual hidden units

241
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,010
will tend to do things they tend to be more like rugged individualists

242
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,090
and like namby pamby socialists

243
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,970
and actually socialist that's an unfortunate analogy but they go

244
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,710
then when you've got all these rugged individualist and you average them you'll get a good job

245
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,980
and joel you went of it

246
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,780
if we compare this with thee

247
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,150
bayesian approach

248
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,940
in embase what you're doing

249
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,810
if you're gonna have lots of separate models are gonna be samples from the posterior

250
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,890
because you can do monte carlo

251
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,230
in the limit the basic things the right thing to do and will win

252
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,730
and we have found an example where bayes beats drop

253
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,170
it's unfortunate that they go

254
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,000
the problem with basis that the test time you have to run only stand models

255
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,500
we drop what you can do is you can learn

256
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,680
exponentially many models

257
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,180
that's you know you can have many more models in your

258
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,010
mix test time

259
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,750
and you've got a very efficient way using the test time

260
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,970
so that you don't suffer from this problem having to run lots and models are tested

261
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,120
you can read about you can read rejected science paper

262
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,400
on my web page

263
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,400
it's a nice easy really because it was written for science

264
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,020
and it's befor eleven twenty

265
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,490
so here's an alternative to dropout

266
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,060
suppose that's on

267
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,700
in terms of what we're gonna do it again taken typically a logistic unit but

268
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,110
also use other consumers but suppose it was a logistic unit

269
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,780
you take a logistic hidden unit it computes the probability pe

270
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,500
and then you might send back to the next level

271
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,380
the computer number people you put the logistic

272
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,270
new might send this number to the next level or you might not faster packed

273
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,940
see send with the probability of not point five

274
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,450
now you get exactly the same expected value

275
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,800
if you send a naught point five with probability p e

276
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,000
so let's suppose we call a spike point five

277
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,970
and we send out with probability p e

278
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,730
that's very similar to drop out

279
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,770
so that's the raises an issue

280
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,080
maybe the brain is doing something very like drop out by using stochastic spikes

281
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,410
so if you look at the variance if we just send one bit

282
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,550
what we discover is so what we can do now is not to drop out

283
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,600
just taken all feedforward neural net

284
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,870
but instead of sending the real valued output the logistics for the next layer

285
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,010
we're going to send

286
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,700
either one or zero without probability

287
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,450
so we drop out you get a variance apiece could over forward spikes are half

288
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,200
and with this stochastic you get a very incipient one month period before

289
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,060
which are likely the same when p equals a half m

290
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,200
when p is low stochastic is actually have more variance

291
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,800
and the limit wimpey's but we a plus one you

292
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:12,110
these small probability events so actually pass neurons with low fine it's actually have even more variants than dropout

293
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,760
so these terms before and now we have this additional terms

294
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,490
some the transpose graph laplacian

295
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,810
and also with this additional terms

296
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,560
we still scale

297
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,810
only linear in the number of data

298
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,470
because for computing

299
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,920
to counter this threat to can reasonably efficient graph

300
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,290
we only have

301
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,610
i complexity of k times the number of times the basis functions which are nonzero

302
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,740
for this point

303
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,620
so it's still linear in the number of data

304
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,790
some first

305
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:54,060
experimental results we have some for some pictures show approach works at all

306
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,640
so we have some

307
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,980
the point here

308
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,590
the point here

309
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,710
this is the normal setting so was out

310
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,810
the new addition normalisation terms

311
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,470
and then we slowly turn on

312
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,030
intrinsic motivation to

313
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,440
and we can see how since

314
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,080
you can

315
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,560
these two

316
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,600
one is

317
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,890
i just want to discuss for you

318
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:33,520
we have a little

319
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,270
o point virginia to the point

320
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,610
point origin the same label because of the same

321
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:48,810
so what you you see the light

322
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,850
the is

323
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,000
the trust

324
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,840
he has

325
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:01,170
this is a

326
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,280
on the floor

327
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:14,010
why not just for them to work

328
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,560
it's more the problem is solved according to the

329
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,000
we have

330
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,050
the business park

331
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,640
how much

332
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,900
what has happened

333
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,590
one small

334
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,970
i did try some some real life data

335
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,340
i would imagine this kind of things happen them

336
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:42,380
or better results not much better some of the success of the

337
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,110
real life data from

338
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,300
two thousand

339
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,800
direct mail campaigns of customers

340
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,150
we know is that response to main

341
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,470
the first part of the city itself

342
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,840
so what is the called

343
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:09,260
five eight ten percent of the five eight ten of the perimeter wall

344
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,940
sent only to these five top five percent

345
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,640
advertising that are very

346
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,080
from this data mining cup for responding

347
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,350
correctly predicted the game hundred eighty five which was

348
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,110
for non responders a lose twelve deutschmark because of the cost

349
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:38,140
data mining cup the winner of what the student competitions the one got sixty seven

350
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,910
so the data mining specialist got eighty five cells and then the normal spots with

351
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,330
classification approach about about eighty seven thousand

352
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,010
and we just try to do the same standing in the same way use thirty

353
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,760
five thousand eight as well

354
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,050
they manage not to

355
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,140
go up to

356
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,650
ninety three cells we improve on of

357
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,710
results before

358
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,750
if it

359
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,960
if this really is belongs to the same as it was part of our adjusted

360
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,890
to fit the parameter fitting differently

361
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,970
o model parameters to fit because of interest intrinsic terms

362
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:21,230
and the somewhat frustrating stuff but in this setting we

363
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,890
for real life data we also managed to get better results

364
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,210
the motives of the men of the combination technique set

365
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,860
for example the three example ten dimensions five noise

366
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,530
we would like to be able to figure out that these five dimensions noise

367
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,830
documents back by

368
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,140
you need to you need to be

369
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,420
no the validity of the source you one of the most important things is to

370
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,610
find sources that you trust

371
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,140
but you you really need you find reliable

372
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,790
although the only internet information comes first and the information about the source comes second

373
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:07,120
which is the exact opposite to the human intelligence for example where you only trust

374
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
information you get from this person

375
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,920
but on the internet you kind of

376
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,930
you don't know whether it's true or the it's alive

377
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,980
and this whole thing now room

378
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,290
falsities propaganda

379
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,950
it tends to fly across the the world in minutes a good example of that

380
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:27,770
was the

381
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,270
the danish cartoon so

382
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,710
there is a a room or a accusation and it spreads across the world in

383
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,210
many cases why

384
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:41,630
the need to know fast this is so important

385
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,680
OK there's another way

386
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,760
minefield of copyright

387
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,820
what exactly you can you do with information taken from the internet what

388
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,110
it's a very grey area and something that

389
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,710
that we have

390
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,710
struggling with as well because we are monitoring news reports

391
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:07,300
the whole legality whether it's you can take information from that authored by somebody else

392
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,280
who owns that information it's a very grey area google got the exactly same problems

393
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,430
and they've been sued about

394
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,640
OK so

395
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,440
OK so it's not just about text i want to give an example here which

396
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,580
is actually taking some work in the JRC

397
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,210
in this case is

398
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,160
which is more to do with it

399
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,170
intelligence gathering on the iranian nuclear program this is what we've been doing with the

400
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,970
which is basically keeping people like salama informed as to what's happening

401
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,050
in that area

402
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,820
this is the area image intelligence well

403
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,970
the first example here is

404
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:55,190
again buying satellite data which you can do on the internet and this is a

405
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,980
actually refugee camp

406
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,310
the or the office of humanitarian aid wanted to know

407
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,960
whether they were over to overpaying for the number of they're playing basically to keep

408
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,030
this refugee camp going they want to know

409
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,550
whether they were overpaying so they wanted to count the number of ten

410
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,470
and then

411
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:18,530
image analysis like this automated software which will go on to identify

412
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,860
this these of this is that the resolution of the imagery

413
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,380
try to identify the which tends

414
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,390
the council attempts

415
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,540
and basically

416
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,390
by enhanced by using pattern recognition software

417
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,440
you can find the computers recognizing

418
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,810
individual parents here which you can count

419
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,160
and this is something that is the procedure that you can automate

420
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,310
this is an example of what you can also use it for counting houses in

421
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,410
cities and so on

422
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,710
that was formerly

423
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,640
important information derived from

424
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,500
data which you've got the basically porcelain

425
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,290
the iranian nuclear program

426
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,130
is and is it everyone is trying to understand where the building a bomb and

427
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:15,540
so on so they are monitoring as the americans and was continuously so

428
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,310
but he can combine

429
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,730
information you get from the internet with satellite data

430
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:26,250
in fact the original whistleblowing on the only iranian programme was done

431
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,570
by a dissident group

432
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:33,020
caught everyone by surprise and that was done through the internet

433
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:38,540
data mining is by in conventional search engines now in order to one because you

434
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,210
need to know about the nuclear fuel structure to understand what's happening

435
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,310
i a

436
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,240
are very because they need to know how far the iranians are from having enough

437
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,030
enriched uranium to build nuclear weapons

438
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:01,330
this is this is a site this is the site in isfahan with making uranium

439
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,580
and this gives you an idea of just how

440
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,630
accurate this satellite data is and here you see any building being put up and

441
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,120
they want to know what that was

442
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,500
and the

443
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,800
lo and behold the search on the internet

444
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,200
in farsi for the right

445
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,850
information we had the woman working with who was iranian

446
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,580
you find

447
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,230
exactly that town

448
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,470
this is on the site which in english is why multilingual it is very important

449
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,940
the english version of the same size of course doesn't have that link because they

450
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,550
remove only the nuclear

451
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,710
the removal in the information in the english version but only in the past especially

452
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,580
but the second example here would be this is damage assessment and the

453
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,910
lebanon war

454
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,450
we were asked to

455
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,660
do damage assessment

456
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,950
for this for the donors conference in stockholm so

457
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,010
again you

458
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,970
you by the the data you basically can task satellite to give you

459
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,680
in this case because you don't want

460
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,280
you have to have the data afterwards

461
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,890
and if ideally one of the data before and after

462
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,740
then you could do change detection

463
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,140
and this was the data was derived in ispra basically from sample from commercial satellite

464
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,940
data which we bought

465
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,690
and we found out how many has been damaged

466
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:36,420
o and call them the same if they're referring to the same entity

467
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,420
so there are about four entities being mentioned here i think

468
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,140
is it about

469
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,660
that's right it's about sort of my or

470
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,210
so so the key here is to figure out which

471
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,750
this is called a part of this is called the reference problem but it's also

472
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,060
sort of you also have to detect all the referring expressions

473
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,550
right and you can see this sort of chunking task but there's this higher level

474
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:09,030
structure you link you link things were denoted here by color

475
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:14,060
OK so detecting entities and deciding which ones corefer and then depending on what type

476
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,870
of text you have you might want to link those school referring expressions back into

477
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,260
some kind of ontology representation of the world so

478
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,790
where there's something comes up for examples in biomedical literature suppose you have an ontology

479
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,390
of all the genes known in the human genome

480
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:32,380
or some of them you might want to look at scientific articles and link back

481
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,030
the references to those genes matter how they look in the tax back into the

482
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,810
OK so

483
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,880
we're going to run out of time if i keep going but there's a whole

484
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,390
another dimension to this

485
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,340
that's worth

486
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,270
bring up because there's there's another sort of data which people have been kind of

487
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:57,100
fascinated by since since maybe twenty years ago which are parallel comparable corpora mostly parallel

488
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:02,160
corpora so parallel corpus is a collection of texts in two or more languages which

489
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,830
are translations of each other

490
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,740
these these come about as a natural byproduct of the working of international organisations like

491
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:14,730
the UN and certain news agencies also the the european parliament and the really nice

492
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,840
because they show you how the same thing is expressed in two different languages

493
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,770
so one idea that's been kind of fooling around for a long time is that

494
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:25,270
you can you can build better models of language if you can kinda triangulate if

495
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,910
you know how the same ideas expressed in two languages that gives you more insight

496
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,530
into what the idea might be and how it might look so there's a ton

497
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,580
of work on things like aligning sense well that was kind of easy we kind

498
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,310
of solve that about ten years ago aligning the words between the two sentences the

499
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:44,080
words that mean the same thing or phrases or aligning the parse trees or

500
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:50,600
finding finding the the underlying bilingual dictionary or are and so on and so on

501
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,270
the biggest application of this course translation

502
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,600
being able to take one of the sides as input and produce the others up

503
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:01,580
so you can think of that itself as the structured prediction problem

504
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:08,100
that was a very gross smattering of some of the problems people are thinking about

505
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,250
in natural language processing and some that they thought about a while back and sort

506
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:15,440
of stop thinking about a lot of these things not everyone agrees that all these

507
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,750
problems are important

508
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,970
so for example

509
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,080
you probably can't you probably going to have a hard time publishing and part of

510
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,170
speech tagging paper about english

511
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:29,030
now it is because it's mostly solved it's not clear that you know that any

512
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:32,710
advances really going to make a difference for any real applications

513
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:39,580
people who focus more on applications like machine translation or summarisation are often skeptical about

514
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,790
any new kind of linguistic analysis and may ask how is going to actually help

515
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:51,070
my application does does does this particular step deserve its own intrinsic evaluation so one

516
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,800
one that's got a lot of attention is word alignment

517
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,760
you've got two sides parallel tax you can use there are many algorithms are trying

518
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,770
to figure out which words on each side of the text line up with which

519
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:04,840
each other words mean the same thing and then people started evaluating its

520
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,770
so people who work on machine translation can scratch their heads and said well you're

521
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,330
word alignment got better but in my ceases system get better

522
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:16,410
so this is this this kind of debate always is going on should we can

523
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,770
evaluate passing on its own anymore is the question it's kind of a controversial question

524
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,060
but it's one that comes up

525
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,370
OK so

526
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:30,760
so right everything in natural language processing comes with controversy i here's here's a suggestion

527
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,770
that there are some problems that have really been viewed as structured prediction directly but

528
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:39,640
but deserve to maybe so one is to find the entire predicate argument structure of

529
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,600
a sentence

530
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,140
a sort of rough approximation to the semantics along the lines of the first order

531
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:48,430
models i was suggesting earlier for the whole sentence that that has really been

532
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,430
tasks that require generation of text where text is the output

533
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,910
answering question translating we talked about that or you get it you get some text

534
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:02,760
in and you want to simplify just clean it up fix its grammar fixes spelling

535
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:06,410
people have really structured prediction models for these things

536
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,450
that wasn't generation as it

537
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,060
but it wasn't a

538
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,950
the what they are you write what were mapping two was was sort of the

539
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,470
first order logic

540
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,830
that they use to transform into single queries

541
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,310
right which they could then post the database

542
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,330
so that's fair

543
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,260
hasn't been done it hasn't been done open domain

544
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,720
that was very restricted domain

545
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,020
key challenges how to come up with ways to compute these functions very quickly in

546
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,870
an online fashion so that you can evaluate ten thousand fourteen seconds like the top

547
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,430
four that's that's the main challenge in these areas so even though you get very

548
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,870
good accuracy

549
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:58,250
that that's again another problem one needs to think about

550
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,620
one could also be something like local models so again this is also not been

551
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,310
done but i'm just trying to solve maybe it's about idea but i don't know

552
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:10,080
so instead of fighting the global logistic regression you might actually fit local logistic regression

553
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,370
so you might say that a single logistic regression may not be a good idea

554
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:18,540
if you want to build small logistics patched him up so for a given class

555
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,120
of any given class of edits

556
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,410
you might have one logistic regression for different classes of course different loss of that

557
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:27,160
you might have another logistic regression but you don't want the user to really tell

558
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,100
you where which class

559
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,510
you don't want to users to really separate out these clusters for you you want

560
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,790
the data to build that automatically for and so again that can be done by

561
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:40,020
fitting a mixture of local logistic regression so this is again something which needs to

562
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,930
be done it has not been done but may be a good idea

563
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:47,660
so we have be sort of hierarchical models with a single tree

564
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,770
but in general there are a lot of trees that are available in the system

565
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:54,810
so there is that hierarchy you also published a hierarchy if you look at the

566
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:59,790
user interface that is analogous general venues solving this problem multiple hierarchies so how do

567
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:04,100
you use these multiple hierarchies and then come up with an efficient smoothing out so

568
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:08,810
move from one hierarchy to multiple hierarchies by doing this that's again another open problem

569
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,970
which is quite interesting you know as soon as you have two hierarchies you start

570
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:16,060
working on this cross product space you no longer have tree now you have it

571
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,080
single a single naughty across further hierarchies can have multiple parents of the tree structure

572
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,810
is lost and all the efficiency in the computation

573
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:29,430
has to be hard to get you can't do the competition in linear time anymore

574
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,520
so you see

575
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,430
so let's say there is a lot so there is a hierarchy

576
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,540
and that is the publisher hierarchy

577
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,390
and now you want to estimate the click-through rate in the cross product space right

578
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:49,600
so for a given had publisher pair you will have multiple parents so you know

579
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,040
for a given publisher you will have about multiple parents and their hierarchy of another

580
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,310
set of parents in this hierarchy if you start looking at the image of the

581
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:01,220
cross product then there is no single parent multiple so

582
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,310
this is no longer the tree and you can't use the tree smoothing algorithms anymore

583
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,410
that are very efficient

584
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,220
you have to

585
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,100
you have to come up with better algorithms to do that if you start using

586
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:16,560
belief propagation that's the complexity is quadratic it's not linear anymore so

587
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,990
knew something like n log n sort of complexity to solve the problem how to

588
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,240
do that is

589
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,680
open question

590
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,600
OK so finally before i end this section

591
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,770
i would like to get mention so one could do a lot of research in

592
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:41,120
improving the machine learning algorithms that are already out there but take

593
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,970
the more challenging question is addressing these are the fundamental issues

594
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,450
that are inherent in this

595
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:51,720
area right positional bias selection bias correlation dynamics these are you

596
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:57,720
more important to solve then actually take logistic regression and improved by another two percent

597
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,490
OK that's that's also important

598
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,290
saying that's not important but

599
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,450
there is very little work in

600
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,270
these areas

601
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:10,410
i think that's more important before we can come up with a more holistic solution

602
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,080
to this whole problem

603
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:18,060
of click-through rate estimation in the context of computational

604
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:27,040
so yes sort four online learning again DP there have been some work

605
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,790
looks like

606
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:57,970
so in so first of all

607
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:03,680
here you get binary feedback on things that you shortly the user in recommender system

608
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,890
like movie recommender systems

609
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,370
users select what movies to look for the great

610
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:13,720
here is that is an ad serving system that decides what i want to show

611
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:20,540
so that is one difference that the difference is that a lot of the information

612
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,970
right about users and about what is in the hard problem for stock problem is

613
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:30,240
you know you get millions of new queries every day millions of new sort of

614
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,890
course start problems have to be solved in many collaborative filtering application that's not really

615
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:39,470
the main focus it has started to become the focus now but that's disassortative and

616
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:42,970
binary data itself makes it more challenging

617
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,430
it does not imply statistics expected the binary feedback has explicit acts

618
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:14,580
there is a i agree that is close relationship but it has not been applied

619
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,470
in this context

620
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,660
using the semantic information i mean i think that's why mention that is close relationship

621
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,540
and does not seem like those techniques have been used a lot for solving this

622
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,100
problem and so there is there is there is opportunity

623
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,120
i read the

624
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,390
that's what this online learning is going to

625
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:40,910
actually address the exact same

626
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,040
we've looked at

627
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,580
i based approaches to match at school

628
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:50,120
but they just look at how we can incorporate historical novel

629
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:55,790
click feedback using machine learning mortars and now we look at the online learning setting

630
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,390
essentially the problem we are trying to solve this is

631
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,810
all the previous approaches just of historical data

632
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,580
now this

633
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,660
a couple of drawbacks one is

634
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,680
the you girl constantly have to retrain your models

635
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,160
as new things become

636
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:16,560
certainly there is some basketball game which became very popular that people are talking about

637
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,600
you want

638
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,350
you have a model that learns the sorts of things very quickly

639
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:24,470
so this means that the system needs to be changed periodically

640
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:28,580
and if you want to stay up date you need to retrain all the which

641
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,910
might possibly be very costly

642
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:36,720
more important that that is what you get the book called the selection bias

643
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:40,430
there are some initial systemic biases in system

644
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,390
which might never get fixed so for instance

645
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,180
suppose that system must learn that

646
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,720
my hands should always have lots of words matching the query

647
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,640
so if

648
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,080
this is the case and someone came up with the but i thought that they

649
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:00,060
never learn that and add that starts about sound system about

650
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,970
is it good at for this particular way because of system that doesn't show any

651
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,310
keywords in the query set

652
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,520
are there is that more folklore example that

653
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,950
if someone is looking at golf pages then you should show in

654
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,040
luxury watch because

655
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,160
in some sense people who are looking at good pages

656
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,080
rich people and then you might be interested in luxury watch ads but this is

657
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,520
something that you would never get if you had a system which

658
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,660
if if you're gonna system never showed such that

659
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,020
then you will never find out that such goodness but set

660
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,830
so what we really need to do

661
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,080
you have

00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,240
it's a couple of announcements

667
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,990
tomorrow there will be a quiz six based on homework six

668
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:07,150
just on the crystallography there's a little bit at the end of homework six

669
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:11,140
on x-rays and we'll just start to talk about x-rays today

670
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,320
so i think that i believe that out just be based on crystallography and i've

671
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,390
as the recitation structures to administer the tests at the end of the period so

672
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,030
you can have some chance to

673
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,960
ask questions

674
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,420
last day we talked about

675
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,800
crystallography we were introduced to the seven crystal systems

676
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,280
and the fourteen grammy lattices which are showing up on

677
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,680
taken from the lecture notes and we saw that if we want to describe the

678
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:45,460
arrangement of atoms in a crystal we could do so by combining

679
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,610
the notion of the brevity lattice

680
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:50,130
of which there are fourteen distinct

681
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,050
with the basis basis could be single atom could be a group of atoms could

682
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,330
be an ion pair could be

683
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,100
and we saw that got us through an elaborate set of crystals

684
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:10,190
and then towards the end we focused on cubic crystals because cubic crystals are representative

685
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,970
of large number of metals

686
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,380
in the periodic table and it's much more tractable

687
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,700
mathematically so going to focus on cubic crystals

688
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,720
i want to continue along with that today and in particular one start looking at

689
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,030
notation the reason one of notation is i want to be able to define a

690
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,970
point lying in the planes so that we start characterizing crystals i can give you

691
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:37,130
a mathematical notation that represents

692
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,850
the faces of the cube

693
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:42,530
the body diagonals of the cube aligned going

694
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,380
on the body diagonals

695
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,480
a line going along the edge

696
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,790
instead of writing it words i want to be able to do so mathematically

697
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,390
and so for that we're gonna

698
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,460
turn two

699
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,890
this handout

700
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:59,540
which has the elements of crystallographic notation quickly go through this last day we started

701
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,650
talking about position so run little sketch here

702
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,640
this is the unit cell

703
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:09,420
the unit cell is the q because we're talking about a cubic system and this

704
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,890
is just the letters i haven't put adams here

705
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,080
OK so i'm just talking about lattice points in space

706
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,670
and just to remind us

707
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,920
a b and c are the unit vectors in a cubic system a equals b

708
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,320
equal c

709
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,820
each of them is equal to a the lattice constant

710
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,150
this is the lattice constant a

711
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,920
that's the dimension a

712
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,390
lattice constant

713
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:38,270
and all angles are right angles so alpha equals b vehicles chemicals nine degrees so

714
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,800
just to just to practice the origin

715
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,770
as i've shown here the origin all we do is right

716
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:48,480
zero zero zero as you when your math class but don't put parentheses around

717
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,770
because parentheses are reserved for

718
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:55,090
playing use parentheses later on the crystallography crystallographic several notation

719
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,150
OK so here is point a

720
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,680
here's what we say it's out

721
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,460
it's on its in the

722
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,180
the y z plane

723
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,050
by the way i've chosen a set of coordinate axes that are in conformity with

724
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,480
the right hand rule

725
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,700
i don't care which axis you choose to be

726
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,950
actually doesn't matter i generally like to make the

727
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:22,400
but i don't care as long as you use the right hand rule

728
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,800
we need to observe the right hand rule because

729
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:29,140
in physics are going to find that there are certain vector forces the are product

730
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:32,110
and cross product and if you don't use the right hand rule convention you get

731
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:38,770
identically backwards so the farm is your x axis y axis is the axis however

732
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,390
you want to do it so i got the x axis coming out of the

733
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,960
board of the y axis and the easy access are in the plane of the

734
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:51,700
if we come here this point a is zero units on the x axis is

735
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:57,120
one unit of the y axis one unit upon z axis to the one one

736
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,280
and b is i've drawn it looks like it's one unit out on the

737
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:05,790
on the x axis it's no units on the y axis and a half the

738
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,900
up on the

739
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,810
of course you can ask the question now which one which is right

740
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:11,970
and the

741
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,970
following so this website where you can enter these stages and you get

742
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:20,650
a lot of it's meaningful sequences sequences that stuff like this

743
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,440
so you can ask the question which one is correct

744
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:25,100
between generalizes

745
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:28,930
and of course you will see this is sort of a stupid questions

746
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,250
lot intelligence tests are built on this kind of thing

747
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,760
and there is no not really a way to tell for the the problem of induction

748
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:39,950
in philosophy

749
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,760
now statistical learning theory which is the

750
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,210
maybe the most

751
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,690
complete theory of of generalization that we have

752
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:54,890
after slightly different question

753
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,220
it doesn't matter which one is correct

754
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,980
but it asks more and better question you ask what are

755
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,340
how what kind of principles one should use

756
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,060
to come up with laws that are probably correct

757
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:08,800
and there should be a bit more accurate here

758
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:10,100
come up with laws

759
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:15,390
but probably as correct on the test data as there are the training data so

760
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:16,730
this how to come up with laws

761
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:22,530
where the training error does not mislead u about the test that you should expect in the future

762
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:28,680
so that's slightly simpler problem and also this problem has been studied philosophy

763
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,810
it has been called the demarcation problem

764
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,300
so that both

765
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,940
this kind of questions have been discussed extensively by pope

766
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:41,110
because this

767
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:47,010
then they probably not only public public class this induction problem all humans problems from david hume

768
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,570
and because this demarcation problem all kinds problems this was

769
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:55,550
this is what kind was interested was one of the things come to mind countries

770
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,260
interested in so basically the question

771
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,750
and what are

772
00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,970
the methodological

773
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,310
principles that distinguish physics from metaphysics

774
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,210
so what what should we be doing to

775
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:10,300
valid uh natural scientific knowledge

776
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,120
okay end

777
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,350
i think i'm going not to not talk about this not because i will talk about it

778
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:22,950
in more detail later on so moving out my latex lines

779
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:37,420
them to the course about kernel methods but i will actually start start with a of learning theory

780
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,030
because i always think it's nice to have a bit beautiful learning theory the beginning of the summer school

781
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,370
so statistical learning theory

782
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,140
this stuff about the time when it is in the sixties

783
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:50,710
we have a model

784
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:56,810
which is that we observe data generated by an unknown stochastic regularity

785
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,510
it is unknown but fixed

786
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,730
i'll say more about this in the mid

787
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:03,060
and learning

788
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:04,760
consists of extracting this

789
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:11,730
and the interesting thing about this area maybe maybe after closed is a bit more

790
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:13,910
so this is that there are

791
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:18,350
basically started about the contaminants during the peacetime feces it

792
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:19,710
the they

793
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,540
they were interested in this problem of

794
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,480
it turned out that that that in in a

795
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,820
relatively simple scenario but it turns out that a lot of structure is already there

796
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,650
there's a lot of interesting stuff came out

797
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:40,570
and they found notions of capacity of complexity function classes and i think working in machine learning

798
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:42,770
you all know about these even

799
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,910
even maybe for your work and not gonna need

800
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,660
things like we see dimension

801
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,290
sorry for taking the cebu here

802
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,450
okay so

803
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:57,660
let's see

804
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,640
so let's start with the problem of pattern recognition

805
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,770
so in pattern recognition and there's also the problem of determining the start with

806
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,120
you want to learn

807
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,280
the function is a function that just takes two possible values

808
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,690
so we have some input domain which could be

809
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:13,850
he said

810
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,830
of plus minus one

811
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:18,350
and you make the assumption that

812
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,050
there were generated i i d e from an

813
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,220
unknown underlying probability distribution joint distribution

814
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:26,690
so that's

815
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:27,510
so the

816
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,290
random experiment

817
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:46,380
so have a random experiment uh this includes a special case was

818
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:51,590
because we have a deterministic relationship between x and while it usually we don't have that

819
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,620
this is a general relationship between x and why

820
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,490
and the goal is

821
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,300
now define a function

822
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,340
takes an input x produces output

823
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:05,090
why which is somehow similar to those

824
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:09,960
and all which somehow typical under this distribution and by this we mean

825
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:11,770
that will minimize

826
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,570
if fix this loss function between for fixed and why

827
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,190
this is a particularly simple loss function

828
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,250
such that the expectation

829
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,480
over the unknown distribution

830
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:23,730
of the loss

831
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,070
we minimize this is called the risk

832
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:27,380
and this

833
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:31,970
most function here is called the zero classification loss function

834
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:33,220
like a zero one

835
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,950
so if you plug in why why is plus minus one

836
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,490
x or y f of x also takes values plus minus one

837
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,690
so this bus lines one this past minus one we take modulus and divided by

838
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:49,730
a factor of two this quantity is zero one depending on whether

839
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,130
if x is equal to one

840
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,410
all different from why

841
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,240
so we want to minimize the expectation that this

842
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:00,230
but we cannot compute this quantity

843
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,710
p is unknown so we need an induction principle and principle

844
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,060
to get us to a function which is close to

845
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:09,220
the minimizer

846
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,160
or function which has a risk is close to the smallest possible one

847
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,330
want to find the function based on the internet

848
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:22,190
and the simplest induction principle is called empirical risk minimization

849
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:27,870
this what about generally started to study in russia in the sixties

850
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:35,760
and this principles basically just says we replace the average over the unknown distribution by an empirical average

851
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,600
over the training example training example

852
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,580
so training examples

853
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,840
is whole set is called training sample

854
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,160
and one of these is an example

855
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:48,970
always see people

856
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,440
calling sample

857
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:54,390
you want to

858
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,240
minimize the training error

859
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,900
it's going to be the empirical approximation is

860
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:03,400
find a function that minimizes this quantity

861
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,260
and then the question is

862
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,220
with function one or

863
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:10,830
when with the risk of the function

864
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,730
converge to the minimal risk

865
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,000
well first you might think that this is trivial

866
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:22,200
this thing called the law of large numbers

867
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,370
which says something about

868
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,350
the convergence of means to expectations so

869
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:28,980
remember that this

870
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:32,170
this thing here is just an empirical mean

871
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:36,050
for some random variable is the expectation of the same random variable

872
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:38,850
so we we

873
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,700
should think that you should be easy

874
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:45,420
the large numbers tells us that such a quantity will converge

875
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,630
its expectation as the number of observations goes to infinity

876
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,310
when we have some fixed function in here

877
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,250
unfortunately there is not enough was this does not imply

878
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:04,150
the empirical risk minimization when he still can result in the limit for that called consistency in statistics

879
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:07,340
the somebody here is that there are several orders

880
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,400
and there are several advertising settings

881
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:12,840
which one you use depends on what you want to achieve

882
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,230
so if your goal is just around the bend

883
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:21,750
get users to nokia product norm company knowledge especially new promotions they were just interested

884
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:26,290
in display advertising you want to get access to internet users and you willing to

885
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,980
pay for the fashion

886
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,920
so CBN is that everyone gets

887
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:36,560
as it is this if you're interested actually attracting users to use particular product content

888
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,880
management sponsored search what you would like to do and here

889
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:44,750
you will typically pay per click so CBC mode use some

890
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:47,290
you pay per action so CPM or get

891
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,400
let's take typically CPC what seems

892
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:55,040
i think that everything would have some

893
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,290
in this should be

894
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:59,560
in the late in which we use to solve

895
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,130
what is the goal of view advertising campaign

896
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:06,690
so we have looked at them and you want to look at the advertising setting

897
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,290
next we look at

898
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:11,480
new and upcoming

899
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,980
well this is an ad exchanges

900
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,340
and this is very new and has

901
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,940
very significant problems

902
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,710
and open problems

903
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:24,730
everything that you have discussed up to now has been like

904
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:25,960
there users

905
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:31,020
content providers and networks advertisers all of them are separated living in their own words

906
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,540
and then this fact that each other in some very structured

907
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,020
but this need not really be so

908
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:42,020
we could essentially be them all tour them together in one big exchange but they

909
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,540
are a bit first

910
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:48,790
a certain amount what have there is no need for me to

911
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:53,610
we could think of publishers being an impression of forces

912
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:58,090
publishers seem to all have just gotten use it what was interested in the product

913
00:55:58,190 --> 00:55:59,560
i can show one that

914
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:00,860
who who wants to

915
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,210
the the highest one for this

916
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:06,440
and now it's advertisers this could say that all i believe p

917
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,860
one and for the CPM sort of setting but i'm willing to stand stands for

918
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,040
CBC city and so

919
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:18,750
all of these available and we have the word of these together into one auction

920
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,840
mechanism and the ship

921
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:24,110
so an example of this would be that

922
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,130
it the publisher

923
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:28,290
and has an impression sense

924
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:30,290
and the different networks

925
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,190
bid for this information so

926
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:37,380
accents could for this impression on behalf of the users

927
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,920
some of the books could be done this

928
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,190
so advertiser

929
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:43,940
could be this impression

930
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,940
via network

931
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,230
and that what

932
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:51,410
it about from the data and so on or something it would actually be effective

933
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:52,650
for this information

934
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:57,710
and all of these books could be four different rewards and somehow combine all of

935
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:01,380
these only one together to figure out which is the highest

936
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,980
and what this gets us

937
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,540
is some sort of transparency some sort of value in the system so the publishers

938
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,680
that you get so high so close to

939
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,410
residents and so much

940
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:14,310
well what goes into it because of the volume of the force

941
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:15,560
that the class

942
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,770
breaks i'm going to try to break glass with you

943
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,200
you see that it is not easy

944
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,720
i have here

945
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:27,810
one class almost the same as the one i have you there

946
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:31,720
and we can illuminate the glass with strobe lights

947
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,040
which you see here

948
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,990
and i'm going to show you there

949
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,500
the display

950
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,430
well that strobe light and the reason why we strobe this

951
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:43,100
that we want you to see as we excite exact frequency

952
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,680
of the class

953
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,140
we wanted to see the motion of the class

954
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:50,350
and the way we can make you see the motion is by stopping not exactly

955
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,430
at the frequency of sound

956
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:54,270
but a little bit differently

957
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:57,620
so you will see the stroboscopic motion then

958
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,890
of the class

959
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:00,720
so i can

960
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:04,560
already i will make it darker shortly but i want to see at least

961
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,240
most of this i can

962
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:07,740
generate and the

963
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:12,740
four hundred and seventy which which is very close to the resonance frequency is the

964
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,810
tongan people use

965
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:19,200
we will increase the volume and then we'll try to get the resonance just right

966
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,140
we may be off by a few words

967
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,430
we have to be right on was in words

968
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:26,490
and and then we'll see where we can make the glass right

969
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,640
i wonder what you sound is going to be very strong

970
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,850
so you may

971
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:34,540
as time goes on as we go to higher volume you may want to to

972
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,450
you may want to closure is in fact i will use this

973
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:39,100
to protect might use

974
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,600
even use this

975
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,910
to protect my eyes case the glass migrate

976
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:49,770
which i doubt whether it will be who knows

977
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:53,500
all right so let's make it very dark

978
00:58:55,060 --> 00:59:04,290
so you see here the glass

979
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,100
not doing very much

980
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,490
and i'm not going to increase

981
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:19,540
the volume of the sound er going to cover my is now

982
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:30,260
prec began to sing some unction now i'm much shorter crop one cross and sherwin

983
00:59:30,260 --> 01:00:12,470
win lose error whom these erued increased false move then now with we'll do o

984
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:32,020
error world move error now i'm not trying to plant

985
01:00:32,530 --> 01:01:09,430
very well the two rules for

986
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:17,580
area of

987
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:34,500
i mentioned that residences can be very destructive

988
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,970
and there are some striking examples in history

989
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:40,830
in fact you may have when this story you may have seen the traffic signs

990
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,540
just sign on all

991
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:46,790
the traffic signs started doing this

992
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,580
so i can write down now

993
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:51,970
in general that he e

994
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,030
and i

995
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:56,900
drop the wordnet now from now on whenever i write e

996
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:59,990
throughout this lecture is always the net electric field

997
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,780
they both into account

998
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:03,530
so you can write down now

999
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:09,480
the three electric field

1000
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:10,970
divided by capt

1001
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,010
one minus p

1002
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,280
is one of the cap

1003
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:20,290
so you see in this

1004
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,410
experiment i did in my head

1005
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,390
the first

1006
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,370
bringing charges on the plate

1007
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:27,220
so the potential difference

1008
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:29,080
removing the power supply

1009
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:35,670
shopping in the dielectric the field will go down by a factor cap

1010
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,910
kappa for glasses about five there will be a major reduction i will show you

1011
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:44,180
that later

1012
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,360
if the

1013
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:47,540
electric field goes down

1014
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:49,140
in this particular

1015
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:52,970
experiment it is clear that the potential difference between the plates

1016
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,460
i will also go down

1017
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,510
because the potential difference between the plates

1018
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:00,580
is always the electric field between the plates

1019
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,720
times t

1020
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:02,620
and so

1021
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,990
if this one goes down by a factor of kappa

1022
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:08,730
if i just shoving the dialectic not changing the

1023
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:12,280
then of course the potential between the plates is also going down

1024
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,270
none of this

1025
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,790
is so intuitive but i will demonstrate that

1026
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,990
the question now arises

1027
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,150
gauss law still holds

1028
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,780
and the answer is yes of course

1029
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:28,780
i was will still hold

1030
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:30,550
gauss law tells me

1031
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:31,700
that the

1032
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,580
closed loop

1033
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:37,740
closed surface i should say not closed to the closed surface integral

1034
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:41,410
of the dot the a

1035
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:44,790
one of the absolute long

1036
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,050
five some

1037
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:49,360
of all the charges inside my box

1038
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:50,990
all the charges

1039
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:55,320
the net charge is that must take into account both the induced charge

1040
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,020
as well as the

1041
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:58,490
free charge

1042
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:02,050
so let me write down here next to remind you that

1043
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:05,040
q net

1044
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,040
it is of course kill free

1045
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:11,280
plus killed in those

1046
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:14,710
and i will remind you that this is my minor

1047
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,340
and this was passed

1048
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,170
the free charge

1049
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,890
positive there

1050
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:24,350
this process and at the same place

1051
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,830
if you have you gaussians surface at the top

1052
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,670
we have the negative charge

1053
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,310
here we do

1054
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:31,800
so therefore

1055
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:33,060
gauss law

1056
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,510
simply means

1057
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:37,570
that you have to take both into account

1058
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:38,940
and so therefore

1059
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:42,170
you can write down one of epsilon zero

1060
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,180
after all three

1061
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:49,640
now you have to make sure that you take the induced charge into account

1062
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:54,650
and therefore you unified the whole thing by kappa that you've automatically taking the induced

1063
01:04:54,650 --> 01:05:00,020
charge into account so you can amend next gauss law very easily

1064
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,010
by this factor

1065
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:05,600
of kappa

1066
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:09,210
the dielectric constant is dimensionless as i mentioned already

1067
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:12,230
it is one in vacuum by definition

1068
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,570
one atmosphere

1069
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:18,270
gas is typically have dielectric constant just a hair larger than one

1070
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:23,310
we will most of the time so this one plastic has the dielectric constant of

1071
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,720
and glass which is an extremely good insulator

1072
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:28,400
as the dielectric constant

1073
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:32,420
of five

1074
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,420
if you have an external fields

1075
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:39,390
that can induce dipoles in molecules

1076
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:41,560
substances however

1077
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:45,870
which themselves really dipoles even in the absence of an

1078
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:50,520
electric fields

1079
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:56,000
if you apply now an external field these dipoles will start to align along the

1080
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,150
electric field we did an experiment ones with some grassy perhaps you remember that

1081
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:03,900
and there's a line in the direction of the electric field they will strengthen the

1082
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,080
electric field

1083
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:09,950
on the other hand because of the temperature of the substance these dipoles

1084
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,760
these molecules which i know

1085
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,670
dipoles by themselves

1086
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:15,330
through chaotic motion

1087
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,580
i will try to is align temperature

1088
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:20,720
trying to this online and so it is going to be a competition on the

1089
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:24,620
one hand between the electric field which tries to align them

1090
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:26,360
and the temperature was tries to

1091
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:28,860
this alignment but if the electric field

1092
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:34,170
strong you can get a substantial amount of alignment

1093
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,470
a permanent dipoles as the rule

1094
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,500
wayne stronger

1095
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:42,270
then any dipole that you can induce by ordinary means

1096
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,930
in the laboratory

1097
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:45,000
and so the

1098
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:50,610
substances which are natural dipoles they have much higher value for kappa much higher dielectric

1099
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,100
the substance is i just this past

1100
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:56,840
which themselves do not have

1101
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:01,400
dipoles one is an example extremely good example electrons

1102
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:04,320
spend a little bit more time maybe oxygen

1103
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:05,990
then near the hydrogen

1104
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,150
and water has a dielectric constant of eighteen

1105
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:10,630
it's enormous

1106
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:15,000
and if you go down to low temperatures you take ice minus forty degrees it

1107
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,130
is even higher than the dielectric constant

1108
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:22,550
is one hundred

1109
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,740
i'm now going to

1110
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,860
son hugh

1111
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,810
through before

1112
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:32,870
demonstrations for experiment one of them you have already seen

1113
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:36,590
and try to follow them as closely as you can because you missed one small

1114
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:38,970
you miss perhaps

1115
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:41,540
a lot

1116
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:42,600
i have two

1117
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,580
parallel plates which are on the table

1118
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:47,740
as you have seen last time

1119
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:52,950
and i have here currently that i put it in a in that means and

1120
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:59,960
and the great have certain separation d

1121
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,950
i'm going to charge

1122
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,070
this capacity up by

1123
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:06,340
these ants

1124
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:08,340
two power supply

1125
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,090
and i'm going to connect them

1126
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:11,590
two fifteen

1127
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:15,510
a hundred volts

1128
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:17,440
already going to set my

1129
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:21,740
light because that's where you're going to see it very shortly

1130
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:25,270
i'm going to start off with the distance d so this is going to be

1131
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,740
like them one

1132
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:29,520
is a distance of one millimeter

1133
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:32,480
and the voltage v always means the voltage

1134
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,300
the potential difference between the plates

1135
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:36,350
it's going to be

1136
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,390
fifteen hundred volts

1137
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:42,840
forgive me for the movies i can help this means you potential difference and this

1138
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:46,420
is the unit impulse

1139
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:48,350
once i have charge

1140
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,970
i disconnect

1141
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:52,360
this is very important

1142
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:56,740
i disconnect the power supply which i write PS

1143
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,570
that's it

1144
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:00,950
so the is now trapped

1145
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:04,460
as i charge it as you saw last time

1146
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:07,060
you will see that the and

1147
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:09,590
shows is short search of current

1148
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:13,400
because as i put charged the plates the charge has to go from the power

1149
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:15,320
to replace

1150
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:17,300
you see a short

1151
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,870
search of current

1152
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:19,830
which will

1153
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,750
make the

1154
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:25,790
and the hand of the powers of the amulet you'll see on the on the

1155
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:27,120
wall there

1156
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,400
as a

1157
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:31,210
might as one

1158
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,120
and divided by p

1159
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:37,540
just rearranging

1160
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,090
and then you will find

1161
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,770
because credit

1162
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,400
omega zero squared

1163
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:49,360
divided by omega supreme

1164
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:50,850
look at this

1165
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:52,540
and convince yourself

1166
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,110
that this equation

1167
01:09:54,120 --> 01:10:00,430
is identical to this one

1168
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,500
if you look in french

1169
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:04,630
french will take you

1170
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:06,370
from here

1171
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,120
one step further

1172
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:12,050
which is huge on trigonometry

1173
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:14,610
and i decided not to go that route

1174
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,780
but you can

1175
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,050
use the values for a p

1176
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:23,450
that we have find

1177
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:26,380
this one

1178
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:27,580
so you can now

1179
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:30,190
besides the trigonometry

1180
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,760
you can find this ratio

1181
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,410
very simple

1182
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:36,210
twice the cosine

1183
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:38,360
so this whole thing

1184
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:40,080
like the cosine

1185
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:43,110
of and by over and was what is correct

1186
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:47,110
and this one so it has no physics there

1187
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:54,450
it's purely a matter of trigonometry

1188
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:58,210
we can now called and nancy

1189
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:02,420
because we know now that we're going to get solutions as a function of the

1190
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,330
number and

1191
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:09,190
and then with a little bit more trigonometry

1192
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:10,330
you really want to

1193
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:12,700
check up on french there which just page

1194
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:17,240
on the then forty one

1195
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,990
he then comes up

1196
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,420
with the normal mode frequencies which are

1197
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,040
our goal

1198
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:28,410
so i will give you the results but really is this is already a year

1199
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:31,260
you get two omega zero

1200
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:35,150
so by no means intuitive

1201
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:37,280
five sign

1202
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:39,900
and i

1203
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:41,640
i'd like to

1204
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:44,680
i this one

1205
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:46,640
and of course i'm going to

1206
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,840
look through that result with you

1207
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,880
as of now

1208
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:50,900
looks very

1209
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:54,930
so this then

1210
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:56,840
is the solution

1211
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:59,200
omega and

1212
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,280
is the solution

1213
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:04,360
i think one color

1214
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:09,960
show you how these link this is the solution for a

1215
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,810
know mode

1216
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:13,830
you know it's particle is

1217
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,930
and you have specified the amplitude

1218
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:19,410
of the sinusoids that this tells you

1219
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:22,640
each particle picture is

1220
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:25,310
if you know the mode and

1221
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,910
you know this is going to be

1222
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,210
the frequency

1223
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:32,260
so you can write down now

1224
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:37,150
y which is the displacement as a function of time is amplitude

1225
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:39,360
why is this place

1226
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,980
now we can put in

1227
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:45,680
the amplitude that we know

1228
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:47,930
it has to be an amplitude

1229
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,030
and i have also

1230
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,140
the cosine omega and

1231
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,240
i'm still

1232
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,710
course you can always phase

1233
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:00,990
and upon equals zero

1234
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,040
what the article is doing

1235
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:04,880
this one

1236
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:06,520
if you have to

1237
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,620
this one frequency

1238
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:09,740
this then

1239
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:12,800
is the time dependence of the displacement

1240
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,670
particle number p

1241
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:25,590
involved and

1242
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:27,670
well i want to do now

1243
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:31,170
is to take a specific example which i also

1244
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:33,350
i will try to demonstrate

1245
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:35,690
which will give you tremendous insight

1246
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:38,090
and actually do it on the left

1247
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:40,460
because this is all very opaque

1248
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:43,760
but when you see an example worked out

1249
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:49,230
you see actually how would also is comes to life

1250
01:13:49,370 --> 01:13:54,770
i'm going to have

1251
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:56,210
five weeks

1252
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:59,880
on the train

1253
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:02,350
one two three four five

1254
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:04,150
next year

1255
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,500
six one

1256
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,090
two o

1257
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:08,490
four five

1258
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:10,190
and two

1259
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,900
that each one is

1260
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:13,230
the separation

1261
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:16,520
his l

1262
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:18,530
so n is five

1263
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,980
you might and

1264
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,490
six by writing down

1265
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:29,380
going to need and this one

1266
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:32,480
and then omega zero

1267
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,750
the square root

1268
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,520
he divided by an

1269
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:45,080
so i'm interested in knowing what the frequency is in the lowest possible

1270
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:48,460
it's going to resemble something like this

1271
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,790
so that frequency omega one

1272
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:56,760
is then to omega zero

1273
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:59,480
times the size

1274
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:02,380
and equals one

1275
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:04,610
capital and was one of six

1276
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:08,460
on the eighty degrees divided by twelve fifteen degrees

1277
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,740
is the science

1278
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:13,290
fifteen degrees right now in degrees because

1279
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,650
i have a better feeling for degrees than i have

1280
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:17,300
four radiance

1281
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:20,680
and that is o point five one

1282
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,460
another omega

1283
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:33,170
and i get the same thing again the reason i get o point five correct

1284
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:34,870
exactly only one

1285
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,040
omega zero

1286
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:39,900
because the science degrees one half

1287
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:41,170
and that itself

1288
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:43,300
this one

1289
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,710
omega three

1290
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:49,080
now we get the sign forty five degrees

1291
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:57,560
is approximately one point four one not exactly

1292
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,330
is the square root of two

1293
01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:03,040
is fun and predict the outcome is unpredictable

1294
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:08,050
so just to give you an idea of what this particular game looks like this

1295
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:13,340
is a screenshot of halo two and you have these various people running around killing

1296
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:19,580
each other for various reasons sometimes they want to capture the flag sometimes they want

1297
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:26,040
to take possession of some strange skull that they carry around like football or sometimes

1298
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:27,890
which is called free for all

1299
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:32,810
they just want to ramp up as many kills as they can

1300
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:36,180
and as you see they have competent instruments for achieving

1301
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:43,690
so here's the problem setting which of course is not specific to video games but

1302
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:48,470
is particularly prominent in video games we have katine's

1303
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:51,150
and for each team where the number of players

1304
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:56,820
and the outcome

1305
01:16:56,860 --> 01:17:01,960
is is essentially a ranking between teams

1306
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:05,920
so let's look at the typical outcome from the game

1307
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:11,550
here this was the team game a red team versus the blue team red one

1308
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:14,330
fifty two forty against the blue team

1309
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:21,130
see here for players on this team here for players in this team this team

1310
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:28,400
so these all have some of the first places these second places and here you

1311
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:34,980
see some extra statistics but in particular it's important to know it is that we

1312
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:40,570
don't take into account in the system the particular school that was achieved but we

1313
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:43,410
just take into account the order

1314
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:47,870
with which the winning order if you like

1315
01:17:47,890 --> 01:17:52,700
the ranking that comes out of the game that loses some information because

1316
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:58,870
the test scores last but it makes the system very very universal so this was

1317
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:03,400
the team game alternatively you can have these individual games

1318
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,500
and then you get the ranking of the players in this game eight players participated

1319
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:14,600
and these are the game attacks these other ranks and you can see here two

1320
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:19,840
people share third place in two people share fifth place because they only killed pathetic

1321
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,430
eleven people in this game

1322
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:27,980
and about the same number obviously and so it would obviously be desirable to take

1323
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:32,500
into account these draws as well in particular because draws give you a lot of

1324
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,260
information because if people draw

1325
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:41,200
then that's an indicator that the playing strength may be very similar

1326
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:46,270
so the question we're asking is how can we assign a skill as i to

1327
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:52,590
player to player i want to all players really such that

1328
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:56,860
if skill the skill of where i is greater than the scale of the j

1329
01:18:56,950 --> 01:19:00,840
then some of the probability that i wins over j

1330
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:05,040
is greater than one half of the probability that i wins is greater than the

1331
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:10,380
probability of j with the interesting thing once we have these numbers is how can

1332
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:13,870
we then from the pool of people

1333
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:15,800
combine them into games

1334
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:18,200
such that they have been a good match

1335
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:19,180
where we

1336
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,850
define a good match

1337
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:23,850
roughly as a match

1338
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:26,770
where the outcome is unclear

1339
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:34,230
he is a very rough idea of how the approach works so

1340
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:38,490
just to see how bayes law ties in here it will then tie in the

1341
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:44,410
more parametric formed but you can think of two statements statement a maybe that player

1342
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:48,330
one's ratings between is in this intervall here

1343
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:51,120
prior to his writing is in the central here

1344
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:55,100
and statement b is the player one wins against player two

1345
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,820
so b is a game outcome and a is the statement about the strength of

1346
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:02,660
the of the players and now what we're interested in is the strength of the

1347
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:07,820
players were interested in the distribution over a given what we observed namely the outcome

1348
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:14,100
of the game and bayes law of course of bayes rule is used to invert

1349
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:18,380
OK so i've got three more sections to cover

1350
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:21,280
and is a little bit shorter than the to cover earlier

1351
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:25,940
the next one is the one that relates most directly to the to build menczer

1352
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:32,600
tutorial this morning and also francis box tutorial last year

1353
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:37,510
really cover this topic i'm just going to focus on a very narrow algorithmic view

1354
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:43,350
of this and that is regularized optimisation with thing you minimizing is f plus some

1355
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:46,330
parameter tau time some regularizer

1356
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:49,760
and i'm really going to talk about one kind of method but it's a pretty

1357
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,900
fundamental kind of method and it's sort of the basis of a family of methods

1358
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:59,860
and that's not to say shrinking uses the shrinking slash thresholding technique

1359
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:02,080
so what's the motivation for all this

1360
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:07,650
often we don't really want to minimize f what we want is an approximate minimiser

1361
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:09,690
of f that in some sense nice

1362
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:12,120
so know what i mean by nice

1363
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:16,650
that all depends on the context if you're dealing with compressed sensing for instance you

1364
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:20,350
want to find an exit has only a few nonzeros

1365
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:25,020
a very tiny fraction of nonzeros if you doing matrix completion problem for instance you

1366
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:27,680
might want to find a matrix has low rank

1367
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:32,710
if you're doing an image denoising problem or deep learning problem you want to find

1368
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:37,490
a solution that has low total variation so by that i mean large areas of

1369
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:41,510
the image have constant intensity of the same colour something

1370
01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:45,550
and there's also this concept that showed up in that next book where he talks

1371
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:52,300
a tradeoff between the quality approximation of the given data and the complexity approximation function

1372
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,880
so if you can formulate the trade-off as

1373
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:58,220
as in this sort of fall

1374
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:02,520
well this so the terms so covers the fit to the data

1375
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:06,820
and this site and somehow covers the the the complexity

1376
01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:08,660
deals with the complexity

1377
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,770
so this is one way to sort of force the solution to have these nice

1378
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:15,910
properties you want you point that i want to make which again came up in

1379
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:20,440
this morning's tutorial is that often it's really hard to pick the town advance you

1380
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:24,690
can get a lot of information about what roughly what size tau is but often

1381
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:29,060
you really don't know exactly what it should be up front even if you have

1382
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:33,350
a good handle on what sort of noise dealing with in the measurements

1383
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:37,660
so you often want to solve not just for one value in isolation but maybe

1384
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:39,940
for a range of values

1385
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:46,100
so the basics of shrinking method very closely tied to what i've been talking about

1386
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:48,390
and also extremely simple

1387
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:53,720
and they work when this that when the regularizer is in some sense simple

1388
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,630
and so what they do is to take

1389
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:58,340
the after

1390
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,760
and say well

1391
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:05,910
is this easy to solve if i replaced by a linear approximation plus the quadratic

1392
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:09,660
in other words i just replaced by

1393
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:15,760
first order approximation right maybe around the current point x palais is the length of

1394
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,880
the move to norm squared minor sex scale by one over two alpha role for

1395
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:22,450
some parameters

1396
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:26,420
and and leave the regularisation term exactly as it is and try to approximate it

1397
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,690
just leave it there

1398
01:23:27,690 --> 01:23:30,410
in its original state

1399
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:33,860
so if i can solve this problem easily

1400
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,970
shrinking method is is definitely one one thing that

1401
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:39,290
you should try

1402
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:43,410
and we'll see in a moment you can solve this problem easily in some sense

1403
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:48,070
for a lot of interesting choices of site so you can rewrite this problem by

1404
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:52,540
just gathering the first two times together and putting it like this and that i

1405
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,790
can define from this i can define

1406
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:58,380
the shrinking operator to be the admin of this thing here

1407
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:02,980
the vectors e that minimizes one of the two alpha times e minus y two

1408
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:06,340
norm squared plus ten times size is OK

1409
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:09,250
again the regularizer p is explicitly

1410
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:12,760
and therefore if i'm using this then the

1411
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:14,570
the step that i've described here

1412
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:18,660
i just get the by defining y to be x minus alpha times g

1413
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:21,510
and by setting alpha to be off

1414
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:27,440
so the simplest sort of shrinking algorithm simply takes the negative gradient step from x

1415
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:30,520
along some great subgradient g

1416
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:33,450
and then shrinks using this operating here

1417
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:41,850
i said that these are interesting when this problem here is easy to solve

1418
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:45,980
and the classic case of the one norm it is really easy to solve

1419
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:51,290
in the one normally do to get this to compute the shrinking operator is just

1420
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:55,150
it is the explicit solution you just take the vector y

1421
01:24:55,160 --> 01:25:00,450
you take the absolute values of all its components you subtract out times of

1422
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,390
if it goes negative you replaced by zero

1423
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:07,250
i plug it into this formula and then multiply that by the original why

1424
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:10,560
so this is all done in order in operations where n is the length of

1425
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,980
thanks tony

1426
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,740
so over the next two hours going to be hearing about dimensionality reduction

1427
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:24,160
as tony said i'm at the university of manchester school of computer science

1428
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:27,270
but i was here in sheffield before

1429
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:30,220
up until about a year ago

1430
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:32,180
OK so

1431
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:36,260
apologies for one thing i was going to be over the last couple of days for that

1432
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:37,310
summer school

1433
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:41,240
i went to school but i had bronchitis

1434
01:25:41,290 --> 01:25:45,510
so if i have a coughing fit at any stage that's the reason why i'm

1435
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:49,690
not sure exactly what triggered by but it can also be triggered by difficult questions

1436
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:54,590
so if you ask difficult questions have a coughing fit although that's why

1437
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:58,590
having said that i do stop and ask questions

1438
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:00,710
this is a new way

1439
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:04,470
as far as i know presenting some of the dimensionality reduction suffered a different way

1440
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:09,150
from what we normally do machine learning but hopefully it's going to give you background

1441
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:11,970
to understand a lot of methods we use i'm not really going to talk in

1442
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:13,780
detail about some of the more

1443
01:26:13,790 --> 01:26:18,340
recent machine learning methods the hopefully going to say give you background for which you

1444
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:23,280
can understand those methods perhaps in unifying way

1445
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:25,610
OK so

1446
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:29,370
we start off with some motivation

1447
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,230
and then we'll do a little bit of background and then i what i want

1448
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:34,200
to really talk about is

1449
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:38,530
dimensionality reduction three distance matching now this is the sort of all the idea and

1450
01:26:38,530 --> 01:26:40,590
it comes from statistics

1451
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,230
then i'll briefly sort of talk about

1452
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:47,840
when we get those distances and how we can try make distances come from along

1453
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,170
the manifold

1454
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,200
they're now

1455
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:55,030
briefly show some stuff model selection for trying to choose what good dimensionality reduction is

1456
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,470
and then we'll and some conclusions

1457
01:26:57,510 --> 01:27:00,720
so all the source code and slides are available online

1458
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:07,450
this talk is also available through from my home page slide that examples are use

1459
01:27:07,450 --> 01:27:09,230
i made little toolbox

1460
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:12,060
called the dean red dimensional reduction toolbox

1461
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:16,440
i just put up their last night and any man commands i'm using for example

1462
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:21,370
via given in typewriter font so i think you should be able to recreate all

1463
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:23,430
the diagrams i'm showing you

1464
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:28,020
all results show you are not showing you significant results in serious datasets it's all

1465
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:29,270
this stuff

1466
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:33,900
by downloading that software

1467
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:35,940
OK motivation

1468
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:41,440
so this is the sort of motivational slides i tend to use for dimensionality reduction

1469
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:49,370
for machine learning for period we were completely obsessed by handwritten digit mainly because they

1470
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:53,120
are used for zipcar recognition in the united states

1471
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:56,120
this is a a and d six

1472
01:27:56,120 --> 01:28:01,520
from the US postal service dataset sets handwritten six and this is the raw form

1473
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,150
of these data come in that typically

1474
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:10,250
preprocessed them using machine learning but this is the overall form you see the data

1475
01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:13,750
this is the sixty four

1476
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:16,870
by fifty seven columns

1477
01:28:16,970 --> 01:28:20,630
thirty three thousand six hundred forty eight dimensions

1478
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:22,770
to this

1479
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,380
data points

1480
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:25,780
obviously the space

1481
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:27,940
contains a lot more than just this digit

1482
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:29,320
and if i sample

1483
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:31,100
randomly from the space

1484
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,880
using the probability of pixel being on

1485
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:38,310
equal to the number of pixels are in the sixth of simple model of sixs

1486
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,900
and this is what i see

1487
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:43,560
another example

1488
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:45,050
still see the six

1489
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:49,900
now that's not surprising because even if we sample every nanosecond from now until the

1490
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:53,150
end of the universe you won't see the original six

1491
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:57,520
that space is so large its two to three thousand six hundred forty eight

1492
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:58,970
that's something like

1493
01:28:58,970 --> 01:29:02,060
there's more possible things can fit in that space than there are

1494
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:04,650
particles in the universe

1495
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:06,460
that's how big that spaces

1496
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,380
so working in that space

1497
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,310
is extremely four

1498
01:29:10,370 --> 01:29:15,490
it's not a good thing to do because you're trying to model

1499
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:17,470
with such an enormous space

1500
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:20,960
there's no possible way that you can get a good idea of when these pixels

1501
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,160
are on when they're off

1502
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:25,090
what correlations between

1503
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:27,990
OK if that wasn't sixty that the final sample

1504
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:29,580
just to prove that point

1505
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:35,520
OK so what's the alternative model of digits

1506
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:39,870
so instead of that model is try something as well let's say that

1507
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,450
all six

1508
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:48,010
perhaps made up by taking a prototype six and rotating

1509
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,450
so this is my way covering all success

1510
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:55,020
you can run this script here and what you'll get

1511
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,320
is this result now

1512
01:29:57,330 --> 01:29:59,100
one of my showing you here

1513
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:02,250
so i've done is i've taken that six

1514
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:07,160
and i rotated at three hundred sixty times one degree each to create a data

1515
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:13,870
them with a data set i taken the first and second principal components of the

1516
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:18,600
and i'm plotting along those components what you immediately see is

1517
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:22,860
if the data lives on a circle

1518
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:26,580
and i'll show you some examples of the six it's the closest point here getting

1519
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:29,410
here the original six is up on the top right here somewhere

1520
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:30,770
and as we rotate

1521
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:35,170
around the circle three rotating in the clockwise way we actually move

1522
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:38,290
coincidentally clockwise around the circle as well

1523
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:41,940
that's anti-clockwise rotation six move clockwise around the circle

1524
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:45,960
and we see all the different sixties we get in the dataset

1525
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:50,800
now if you keep looking at the principal components

1526
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:55,420
this data you keep saying that this is the one dimensional structure until you start

1527
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:58,330
to get very low numbers of principal components

1528
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:02,180
and when you get those low numbers of prince components what you get is artifacts

1529
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:06,060
in the rotation algorithm so this is an image rotation so when you rotate the

1530
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:12,380
it doesn't quite work perfectly look at these two pixels here right

1531
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:15,230
as you rotate them a sort of separate

1532
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:19,350
so there's some sort of interpolation you as you rotate is not exact number degrees

1533
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:22,660
of some sort of interpolation so that leads to some sort of a little bit

1534
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:24,050
of noise

1535
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:28,190
on this circle is particularly visible there

1536
01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:29,600
and there

1537
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:30,990
and there

1538
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:35,040
and so you get this little noise which is to do with whatever algorithm the

1539
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,190
image rotation

1540
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:40,050
and this is just an image rotation i downloaded from the web is using to

1541
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:42,450
interpolate those pixels

1542
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:44,120
OK so basically

1543
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:47,690
this is one dimensional structure with some noise

1544
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:48,960
now you could argue

1545
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:54,350
those are all sixs and indeed these guys down here nine

1546
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:58,330
so this is the most sixes in nineteen effects because it's really not a full

1547
01:31:58,330 --> 01:32:01,760
in one step right

1548
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:06,980
from one step they do it most people work

1549
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,290
do more than p work

1550
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:11,190
and so

1551
01:32:11,190 --> 01:32:14,050
if they can do most people work in one step

1552
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:15,340
then if the

1553
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:18,550
if the number of steps was in fact less than t one over p they

1554
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:21,760
will be able to do more than

1555
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:27,360
they will be able to do more than thirty one work in peace steps

1556
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:31,480
there's only t one work to be done

1557
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:33,670
OK i just stated that

1558
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:38,740
almost as badly as all the responses i got from the i OK

1559
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:43,220
p processes can do it most people work in one step

1560
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:47,460
so if there's t one work to be done

1561
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:50,570
number steps is going to be at least tp is going to be released t

1562
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:52,570
one over p

1563
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:58,850
it's not that hard just like i get a certain amount of t one work

1564
01:32:58,850 --> 01:32:59,110
to do

1565
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:05,250
i can not copy at most p on every step how many steps to provide

1566
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:08,840
was going to have to be at least that amount

1567
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:13,760
the other bound lower bound is tp

1568
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:16,530
is greater than equal to t infinity

1569
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:25,870
so explain to me why that might be true

1570
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:34,050
if you have an infinite number of processors you also have

1571
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:35,390
you know that p

1572
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:37,020
so if you could do it

1573
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:40,490
in in a certain amount of time with people certainly do that time with an

1574
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:44,570
infinite number of processors this is in this model where where there's lots of stuff

1575
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:48,440
that this model doesn't model like communication costs

1576
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:52,080
and interference in all sorts of things but in this simple model

1577
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:55,070
OK which actually in practice it works out pretty well

1578
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:57,920
OK this is a node

1579
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,530
you're not going to be able

1580
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,260
to do

1581
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:05,830
more work with p processors then you are with an infinite number of processors

1582
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:24,430
so those are helpful

1583
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:28,900
those are helpful bounds for

1584
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:32,910
to understand when we when we're trying to make something

1585
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:34,660
go faster

1586
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:35,790
it's nice to know

1587
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:39,000
what you could possibly hope to achieve

1588
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,990
OK as opposed to

1589
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:44,840
now being ahead against how come i can get it to go much faster maybe

1590
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,470
it's because one of these lower bounds is

1591
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:53,000
OK well richard how fast we can go

1592
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:57,080
that's the main reason for using

1593
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:01,750
multiple processors if you hope you can go faster than you could with one process

1594
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,760
so we define t one

1595
01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:05,430
over TCP

1596
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,950
the the speed of

1597
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:13,300
on p

1598
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:19,180
so we say how much

1599
01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:26,110
you know faster is it on p processors than on one process

1600
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:27,750
so that's the speedup

1601
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:31,970
if t one over TCP

1602
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:34,470
is or

1603
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:39,020
we say that the linear speed

1604
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:48,360
in other words why because that says that

1605
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:50,470
but if the

1606
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:55,620
if it means that i've thrown keep processors at the jobs

1607
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:58,690
i'm going to get a speedup that's proportional

1608
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:03,720
i mean speedup is proportional to pay

1609
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:08,230
OK so what i throw p processors at the job and get tp

1610
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:13,110
if that's water p that means that in some sense my processors each contributed to

1611
01:36:13,150 --> 01:36:17,250
within a constant factor all measure of

1612
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:21,370
support if this in fact is we're equal to p we call that perfect linear

1613
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:27,330
so but here we're looking at at

1614
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:30,610
so you know giving ourselves for theoretical purposes

1615
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:32,820
a little bit of a constant buffer here

1616
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:37,540
if i t one

1617
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:42,280
tp is greater than p

1618
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:44,850
we call that superlinear

1619
01:36:56,070 --> 01:36:59,620
so we can see somebody tell me when it when can i get super linear

1620
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,700
when can i get super linear speedup

1621
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:17,410
OK well never

1622
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:21,030
we by these

1623
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:25,260
lower bound first lower bound there exist tp is greater than equal to t one

1624
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:26,980
over p

1625
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:28,560
if i just

1626
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:30,500
take t one over p

1627
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:33,690
that says is less than or equal to k

1628
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:37,440
so this is never a not possible in this model

1629
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:47,340
there are other models where it is possible to get super linear speedup due to

1630
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:48,960
caching effects

1631
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,590
and things of that nature but in this simple model that we're dealing with

1632
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,210
not possible to get super linear speedup

1633
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:00,810
not possible

1634
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:04,500
now the maximum possible speed

1635
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:19,850
so amount of work and

1636
01:38:19,870 --> 01:38:23,000
critical path length is

1637
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:30,960
is what's the maximum possible speed up i can get

1638
01:38:30,970 --> 01:38:33,660
over any number process

1639
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:39,760
what's the maximum i could possibly get

1640
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,380
three by three

1641
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,190
as the rank two one stores

1642
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:46,650
still in the rank two things

1643
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:53,570
if three by three and with eight specifying eight x well problem where

1644
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:56,070
that's a only one left

1645
01:38:56,130 --> 01:39:00,340
only one freedom left but i want to get only i'm aiming for rank two

1646
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,530
i do i do it

1647
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:10,990
that's right so in terms of linear algebra

1648
01:39:11,010 --> 01:39:13,820
so this is unspecified in the

1649
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,120
are some combination of that well

1650
01:39:17,150 --> 01:39:21,840
another quick way to say it is make the determinant

1651
01:39:24,110 --> 01:39:26,570
make that determination

1652
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:28,570
the whole of the three by three

1653
01:39:28,570 --> 01:39:34,130
if the three by three determinant is zero what's the rank

1654
01:39:34,130 --> 01:39:35,510
less than three

1655
01:39:37,150 --> 01:39:38,800
take two right

1656
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,170
no no no no

1657
01:39:42,190 --> 01:39:48,690
lesser evil right to less referring to i to achieve right to but of course

1658
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:51,570
if i made if i specified stuff

1659
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:56,320
you know if i specified that rho exactly the same direction as that role then

1660
01:39:56,990 --> 01:40:00,320
all sorts of stuff like could maybe even get lower right but

1661
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:03,670
but i'm shooting here for rank two something saying if you give me a i

1662
01:40:03,670 --> 01:40:08,400
can certainly tell in nine one one way the way we saw it was some

1663
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:13,380
combination of role in that role close to write and tell me what that has

1664
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:14,130
to be

1665
01:40:14,150 --> 01:40:18,190
and this i'm just saying to say the same thing in another language

1666
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:22,220
some number that will make the determinant zero

1667
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:25,070
number there are making a zero-sum OK

1668
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:31,090
so the three by three completing the rank two no problem

1669
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:35,440
but for by four with twelve specified completing the rank two

1670
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:36,920
a big headache

1671
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:40,840
OK so can i show can come back to this one now this is my

1672
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:44,050
last case that i know of

1673
01:40:44,150 --> 01:40:47,170
the goal is to

1674
01:40:47,170 --> 01:40:49,030
get the theorem to work

1675
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:55,860
rank to completion where this for OK here with the idea

1676
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,880
suppose i look at it

1677
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:01,550
this and this

1678
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:04,630
three by three

1679
01:41:04,650 --> 01:41:10,630
and i certainly have to complete that to rank two

1680
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:15,690
what will it take

1681
01:41:15,690 --> 01:41:18,090
let's look at the determinant

1682
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:22,630
so i'd like to complete this so what's the determinant have to make the determinant

1683
01:41:22,630 --> 01:41:25,530
zero right

1684
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:29,460
five a three by three and trying to get lower rank rank two surely means

1685
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:31,800
it's singular is determined to zero

1686
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:40,300
turns that will have to be zero so what's what is the term a times

1687
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:44,510
a time b time something

1688
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:52,760
and then what else do you remember the three by three determined

1689
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:57,900
what's it going to look like it only involves is the maybe term and then

1690
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:01,240
there's b and eight times something

1691
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:04,480
eight times some

1692
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:09,460
specified in the times something specified

1693
01:42:10,530 --> 01:42:21,720
another constant other specified terms that don't involve a and b has to be zero

1694
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:25,720
that's the term that's the three by three to ten

1695
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:28,980
OK but the thing is that involves both a and b

1696
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:34,940
i mean that's only one of the many equations many three by three determinants but

1697
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,610
it's the one i want to look at

1698
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:39,400
and the other one i want to look at is

1699
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:40,860
this one

1700
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:45,070
circle the another three by three that's interesting

1701
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:54,260
i just want to use a and b i want to use this

1702
01:43:05,190 --> 01:43:07,760
a b were gone

1703
01:43:08,510 --> 01:43:09,610
help me here

1704
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:14,590
looking for and this is the right

1705
01:43:14,610 --> 01:43:19,130
i'm looking for us three

1706
01:43:19,130 --> 01:43:20,380
no not here

1707
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:23,610
and this

1708
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:30,340
there's another three by three

1709
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:33,710
so it's determined also has to be zero

1710
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:39,110
and it involves its independent because it involves these three numbers and these three that

1711
01:43:39,110 --> 01:43:44,380
work that appears here so far this is determined to be zero OK what's it

1712
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:46,210
was that the terminal again

1713
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:52,210
maybe looks just like this a b time some other specified thing plus a time

1714
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:58,820
some other specified thing q plus the time some other specified thing or plus some

1715
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:07,210
specified thing has to be zero

1716
01:44:10,650 --> 01:44:12,740
out of this second here's the

1717
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:16,710
punchline them out of this i can determine a and b

1718
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:21,420
because of branching time logics we need to talk about trees

1719
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:25,590
if i manage to show you a lot of good theoretical results powerful things on

1720
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:26,820
binary trees

1721
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:31,960
it will be after you understand the place on the by which we could be

1722
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:36,460
a little exercise only to imagine that you also would like to have logic which

1723
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:37,800
ideally talks

1724
01:44:39,570 --> 01:44:42,030
i mean the trees that are obtained

1725
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:49,250
and i structure which is not necessarily binary in four

1726
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:50,210
thank you

1727
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:55,280
the tree that have drawn locates binary made it pretty well because i have only

1728
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,750
two outgoing branches of

1729
01:44:58,670 --> 01:44:59,880
from each state

1730
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,550
so i made a binary

1731
01:45:01,590 --> 01:45:04,940
but it's not fool for example this one has no

1732
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:11,030
i mean if you

1733
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:14,030
trust me a bit

1734
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:18,800
i see that the the content of the theory with the full binary tree

1735
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:22,480
and then if you want i mean we can quietly with having coffee we can

1736
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:25,090
how to make it with

1737
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:30,000
some more general trees like structures but it's not so

1738
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:32,130
it's not that difficult part

1739
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:34,170
so we're gonna stick to

1740
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:35,900
the full binary tree

1741
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:42,920
i went to be labeled

1742
01:45:45,670 --> 01:45:49,780
that this information would correspond to the information

1743
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:54,130
well it's any kind of information you can think of but if you want to

1744
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:56,320
understand the binary tree as

1745
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:57,530
and objects

1746
01:45:57,530 --> 01:45:59,340
which has been derived

1747
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:05,360
from an unraveling of some cryptic kripke structure which itself has been obtained

1748
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:11,110
but in the fraction of a given program text lines and numbers encoding so this

1749
01:46:11,110 --> 01:46:13,000
isn't sorry

1750
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:16,780
what i want to have is that i want to have labels node

1751
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:19,670
and the labels the labels like a here

1752
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:24,170
you can think of it as a set of propositions

1753
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:27,460
propositions that hold

1754
01:46:28,130 --> 01:46:31,230
i mean at that at this moment here

1755
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:36,900
this is just the certain moment in the future but of this particular future here

1756
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,610
and what is true here

1757
01:46:38,630 --> 01:46:42,070
look at a set of propositions

1758
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:45,650
and the propositions that whatever the i i mean the critical section the other one

1759
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:48,050
is expecting to and

1760
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:50,320
so the

1761
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:54,360
the objects were going to work with our

1762
01:46:55,690 --> 01:46:57,480
which structure is

1763
01:46:57,570 --> 01:46:59,820
the binary tree

1764
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:01,480
but i can have

1765
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:04,000
arbitrarily many

1766
01:47:06,610 --> 01:47:09,940
by choosing different labels of the nodes

1767
01:47:10,210 --> 01:47:14,520
so you find the most no

1768
01:47:14,530 --> 01:47:16,570
so only binary trees

1769
01:47:16,630 --> 01:47:18,800
so this is the formal definition

1770
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:22,050
so how do you define treated you have it already

1771
01:47:22,090 --> 01:47:24,300
during the summer school

1772
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:26,110
did anybody trees now

1773
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:27,940
so i don't trees

1774
01:47:28,630 --> 01:47:30,210
trees are easy to

1775
01:47:30,230 --> 01:47:35,030
to define issue on binary trees you have to give me directions to go down

1776
01:47:35,050 --> 01:47:35,820
the tree

1777
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:39,690
so if i want to be binary any two directions left or right

1778
01:47:39,710 --> 01:47:41,420
o zero or one

1779
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:43,520
say if i want

1780
01:47:43,630 --> 01:47:46,050
the trees of degree k

1781
01:47:46,070 --> 01:47:49,860
i need k directions from zero to k minus one of the one to k

1782
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:51,110
is like

1783
01:47:51,150 --> 01:47:53,690
OK so here what we have is that

1784
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:57,320
if want to characterize the position in the in the in the tree in the

1785
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:59,690
full binary tree i have to tell you

1786
01:47:59,710 --> 01:48:00,780
how to go down

1787
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,340
so i can go down

1788
01:48:03,170 --> 01:48:06,860
so instead of left and right there was easy one cyclin goes he was he

1789
01:48:06,860 --> 01:48:08,960
was he was you why

1790
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:10,480
so i go left

1791
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,520
three times and then turn right

1792
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:15,100
times l square

1793
01:48:15,110 --> 01:48:18,220
so i go to this equation and so i ask what is the period

1794
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:19,710
of the pendulum

1795
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:22,230
and you're not surprised that you find

1796
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:24,350
two pi

1797
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:25,990
and the square root of fellow which

1798
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,550
we've seen that before

1799
01:48:27,630 --> 01:48:28,560
but of course

1800
01:48:28,570 --> 01:48:30,300
it also comes out

1801
01:48:30,350 --> 01:48:32,750
if you do it in this more complicated way

1802
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:34,240
so here we get to buy

1803
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:36,260
times square

1804
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:43,600
that's now do the

1805
01:48:48,150 --> 01:48:54,350
the ring

1806
01:48:54,380 --> 01:48:56,810
david about point b here

1807
01:48:56,850 --> 01:48:59,100
here is the centre of mass

1808
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:01,450
right in the middle in the middle of nowhere

1809
01:49:01,490 --> 01:49:04,150
here's the centre of mass

1810
01:49:04,210 --> 01:49:05,720
and so the

1811
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,320
distance be

1812
01:49:07,510 --> 01:49:09,470
is the radius

1813
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:11,090
of the rings

1814
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:16,120
so we have to calculate the moment of inertia about point p

1815
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:19,280
again we used to have have to use now the parallel axis theorem it is

1816
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:21,870
moment of inertia for rotation

1817
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:23,210
about this axis

1818
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:25,680
two points in the centre of mass

1819
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:27,950
that is m are

1820
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:31,130
these are the the ratings of the ring

1821
01:49:31,190 --> 01:49:34,800
all the masses at the circumference

1822
01:49:34,810 --> 01:49:38,710
all the distance are from the centre of mass and then we have to

1823
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:39,810
after that

1824
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:46,310
according to repel axis theorem the mass times this distance squared and these distances are

1825
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:49,480
so you get a mask

1826
01:49:49,490 --> 01:49:53,610
so it is too and ask screen

1827
01:49:53,670 --> 01:49:55,520
so what is the period

1828
01:49:55,650 --> 01:49:58,840
of an oscillation

1829
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:00,600
i of p

1830
01:50:00,650 --> 01:50:02,620
that is to a masquerade

1831
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:05,750
divided by

1832
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:09,120
BMG these are are MG

1833
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:13,580
lose one hour

1834
01:50:13,590 --> 01:50:15,970
i woosnam we've seen this before

1835
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:17,370
i derive this

1836
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:20,230
lecture number twenty one

1837
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:24,470
i remember everything by-election number believe

1838
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:27,430
so the period now

1839
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:29,190
is the same as the pendulum

1840
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,330
with links to are

1841
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,600
this is the ring

1842
01:50:33,650 --> 01:50:35,550
so here we have two pi

1843
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,700
times square root

1844
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:39,450
two are

1845
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:43,390
guided by geo make a comparison very shortly i just want to

1846
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,190
finish them all

1847
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:47,300
and i would like to do

1848
01:50:50,990 --> 01:50:54,070
but not least

1849
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:55,840
put it this

1850
01:50:55,850 --> 01:50:59,240
all we have to do now is calculate the moment of inertia this was very

1851
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:00,600
close to you

1852
01:51:00,650 --> 01:51:03,240
the problem we had on the exam

1853
01:51:03,250 --> 01:51:04,990
you have the disk

1854
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,450
solar disc

1855
01:51:06,490 --> 01:51:11,220
this is point this is the centre of mass but now it's solid

1856
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:12,450
so again be

1857
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:13,810
these are

1858
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:17,100
separation between c and b

1859
01:51:17,110 --> 01:51:21,750
and the moment of inertia for rotation about point p

1860
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:25,400
it's now moment of inertia for rotation about the centre of mass

1861
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:28,220
which you look up in the table in the case of u examples was given

1862
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:29,730
on the front cover

1863
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:30,930
one half

1864
01:51:32,850 --> 01:51:34,220
are square

1865
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:37,610
that's the moment of inertia for rotation about the centre of mass

1866
01:51:37,630 --> 01:51:39,130
now we have to add

1867
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:41,710
this grid

1868
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,580
and the are

1869
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:44,840
so we have to

1870
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:49,220
so we find

1871
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:50,480
three half

1872
01:51:53,350 --> 01:51:55,080
so what is period

1873
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:01,560
times three half

1874
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:03,690
m ask red

1875
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:05,780
divided by BMG

1876
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,380
these are

1877
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:13,940
and that equals

1878
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,020
two pi

1879
01:52:15,070 --> 01:52:17,730
and square root

1880
01:52:17,870 --> 01:52:20,930
lose my and there's always and was are

1881
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:22,880
i get your free half

1882
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:26,400
five i g

1883
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:29,630
so let's write that down here

1884
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:31,670
so we have two pi

1885
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:37,230
and square root

1886
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:39,520
we have are

1887
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:41,560
five advisor

1888
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,450
so we have them all for their

1889
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:45,050
so we can now

1890
01:52:45,090 --> 01:52:46,970
make meaningful

1891
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:51,970
we want to periods to be the same

1892
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:54,210
so we can hang on to those numbers
