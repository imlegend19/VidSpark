1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,750
we have all of the

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,810
we have to add in

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,420
but all the lists together add up to just water and

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,230
all these add up to order m squared plus

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,500
they and

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,980
so this is how much

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,580
by at all this together what is this asymptotically

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,460
as n log n

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,850
OK so the team is actually bounded by in n

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,870
so we're lucky

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,830
those people guess lucky right

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,870
o one ten to nine ten split

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,710
is asymptotically as good as a fifty fifty split

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,870
in fact we can lower bound s

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,190
by just looking at these things here

16
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,830
and discover that

17
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,920
in fact

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,980
teevan is lower bounded by

19
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,230
log base ten n

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,520
plus water and

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,080
so tmn is lower bounded by also

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,790
asymptotically in logan city of and is actually data of n log n

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,170
this is not really approved this is i generally recommend you don't do this kind

24
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,620
of thing for

25
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,080
to to do approve this is a good intuition recursion trees the way proved this

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,920
is one

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,460
substitution method good

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,870
OK so what you do is use this

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,480
to get your gas

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,290
then use substitution method to prove

31
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,830
your guess is right

32
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,330
because too easy to make mistakes with this method

33
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,650
OK very easy to make mistakes or substitution method

34
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,060
OK it's hard to make mistakes

35
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,730
because there's just algebra there are cranking through

36
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,040
so it's easier to verify rather than dot dot dot trees that drew improperly and

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,850
road in wrong amounts and so forth OK

38
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,210
so this is an organ so that's pretty good

39
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,020
so it's or log and we're lucky

40
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,600
so now let's try another one

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,440
suppose is offering tuition

42
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,960
because i tell you by the time we get to the end of this class

43
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,830
you folks are going to be all things to the door

44
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,420
OK because you going to some good map today actually it's actually fun math i

45
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,370
think but

46
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,140
it is challenging

47
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,500
so it's not away

48
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,460
can still sleep now

49
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,710
tell you want to wake up

50
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,060
one more bit of intuition suppose that we alternate steps

51
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,580
suppose we do that

52
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,350
the partitioning thing and we it happens

53
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,100
where we start out lucky

54
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
and then we do

55
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,060
have this partition step that's unlucky

56
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,000
now we have step that's lucky

57
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,710
this step is unlucky

58
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,810
we do that all the way down the tree

59
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,460
OK so i suppose

60
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,940
we also

61
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,170
so we lucky or unlucky if we do that

62
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,900
OK so everybody voting doesn't matter what your answers

63
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,580
OK everybody has stake in the game razorlight like course racing every watch racing is

64
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,900
really boring

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,080
you probably money down

66
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,750
OK will stay in the game

67
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,210
OK suddenly is interesting

68
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,980
OK so the same thing here in case i want everybody

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,230
every some skin in the game who thinks this is going to be lucky

70
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,140
well who thinks you can be unlucky

71
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,670
well OK

72
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,940
who didn't vote

73
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,440
you guys

74
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,270
no skin in the game

75
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,060
OK so let's analyse this

76
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,150
so we can once again writer recurrence

77
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,190
unlike step will have l of and b the running time on the left step

78
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,330
size and that's going to be twice while the next step is going to be

79
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,770
unblocked those two unlike things over two

80
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,810
i was wondering and

81
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,960
that's all i can

82
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,000
the key step

83
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,310
we already have that is essentially going to l of n minus one can be

84
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,400
lucky in the next step were

85
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,170
but unlike

86
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:44,230
cpl i've described this behaviour with with a system now of occurrences

87
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,150
OK that are dependent where the boundary cases once again which are unstated is that

88
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,100
the recurrences of constant solution

89
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,980
OK with constant input

90
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,040
now we just do a little bit of algebra using substitution l of n

91
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,580
is then equal to well

92
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,540
i can just plug in

93
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,920
or you have an over to plug in

94
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,060
the value of you of an over two

95
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,290
and that gives me a

96
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,460
l and over two minus one

97
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,020
plus they are

98
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,520
first the

99
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,750
so see how people see what i did here

100
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,770
very simple plugin

101
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,790
three you have an over two i plugged in this

102
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,980
recurrence in fact technically i guess i should say here's data over to just make

103
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,150
make this substitution more straight for the same thing

104
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,100
just to make it

105
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,140
not to skip this step

106
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,540
skipper step

107
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,150
so that we can now crank through and that's too

108
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,000
l n over two minus one

109
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,830
and now i have to say to

110
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,790
two years plus another one

111
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,290
so all that is just water and

112
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,620
what's the solution that current

113
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,190
n log n

114
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,730
and log n

115
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,020
they receive

116
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,810
they then again so

117
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,650
basically just once again master theorem

118
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,110
and education for management

119
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,540
we never thought

120
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,870
for one parliament

121
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,540
how we actually educated professionals in our country

122
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,090
we never thought

123
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,110
just putting doctors into classrooms

124
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,740
for two years we shouldn't have some real patients

125
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,790
we never thought of putting architects

126
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,920
two clusters

127
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,920
for two years without actually

128
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,730
so you know what buildings

129
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,410
you know how you constructed building and how you could calculate stress things and so

130
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,660
on and so on all professional and individual countries but in our country all are

131
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,000
little of formed as the french were but it

132
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,040
by mixture of classroom education supplemented

133
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,270
supplemented by two to experience

134
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,210
in the real world

135
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,850
on the don't think doing the same

136
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,060
the managers

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,680
why we so blind as to think that you could translate things and transport things

138
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,800
from one culture

139
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,770
to another even though we both supposedly spoke the same language

140
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,350
but that's not true course speaker very different languages with

141
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,840
so indeed the math you've been hearing this morning

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,230
i don't believe that what we do in the UK

143
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,330
o if did

144
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,360
in america is the right thing for you in fact i don't think it's even

145
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,040
write for us

146
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,830
we actually also sort

147
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,670
because of our experience in american schools and tradition and so on

148
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,060
but actually management

149
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,170
could be

150
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,770
a sort of science

151
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,050
the mixture of

152
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,170
you know formulae

153
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,540
and matrices are numbers and things like that

154
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,420
it could be written down

155
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,110
and translated and transmitted

156
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,480
two other people and that would then equip them to go forth into the world

157
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,350
and manage other people i don't think that's true for

158
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,090
this the process can be reduced to the

159
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,430
as i say in due course but that doesn't turn you into a manager

160
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,650
i also think that

161
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,980
we've got seduced by our clients

162
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,280
we get them what they wanted

163
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,430
we became translators

164
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,970
much more than we were inquisitors

165
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,980
what we did was we went around we saw what

166
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,190
what indeed the leading businesses were doing and we codified that in some way

167
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,640
and then we passed it on

168
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,310
so in a sense we were always out of date

169
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,730
he was talking what people did by the time he codified it was another year

170
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,130
so we were always passing on what we thought was the fastest

171
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,020
never query

172
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,230
we never said why

173
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,500
if you do this

174
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,970
you know

175
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,100
we've seen

176
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,490
i would just killing of the CEO of enron went to the harvard business school

177
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,810
with all the lights went out

178
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,060
the professors clambered around him

179
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,900
desperately anxious right yet another case study about this wonderful company

180
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,660
nobody query that business plan

181
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,120
nobody the questions

182
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,850
i became ashamed at the london business school actually we never questioned any of the

183
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:59,440
practices of businesses that we were just slavishly wandering into copying the stories writing the

184
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,390
case studies party the models except was

185
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,400
was that our job

186
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,780
was that hard job

187
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,260
just accept what the world was offering

188
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,060
codified and pass it on

189
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,100
i think we were we were very wrong very mistake was seduced by times

190
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,350
we were business

191
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,560
we get the clients what they wanted rather than what they should have had it

192
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,370
wasn't education and really any real sense of the word

193
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,110
well i have to say

194
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,510
that after ten years

195
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,660
i left

196
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,610
a disappointed man

197
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,880
i run the programs

198
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:45,980
first loan program full-time executive program for nine months that was situated created in in

199
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,110
around the MBA program the for cup three years or so

200
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,000
and after disappointed man

201
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,950
i realize that actually

202
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,430
i been training consultants

203
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,990
i've been teaching young people

204
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,160
how analyse business problems

205
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,610
analyse companies

206
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,440
they went forth and they were brilliant consultants some of them became bankers one or

207
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,050
two and became corporate planners corporate strategists

208
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,680
very few of them actually managed people

209
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,800
it didn't out to that they had no experience with that

210
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,250
they just analyse things

211
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,240
that is not what i came in to change the face of british management for

212
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,340
to read a whole host of consultants they were very grateful and a lot of

213
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,890
received the times that he

214
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,230
you can set up this recursion

215
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,480
between the

216
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,470
the thought that it turns

217
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,400
so the thought internet ten times that he

218
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,150
is nothing but the man turned

219
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,980
received at time

220
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,670
glasgow times

221
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,110
the that occurred in time step t plus y so that simple that follows from

222
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,980
the definition of SLT t

223
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:04,290
and once you realise that the next thing that you could realizes that

224
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,780
the value function of the value function would be perfect

225
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,090
you could even improve these estimates by replacing st plus y

226
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,490
by the value of state

227
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,880
at the next time step actually plus one

228
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,520
so the value function with perfect that would be even better

229
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,830
the a function might not be perfect but it might be a good good enough

230
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,700
estimates so why not trying to use

231
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,360
that value

232
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,880
and the computation

233
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,840
so that's the idea so

234
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,270
the simplest temporal difference target misty zero

235
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,960
and it is that this is enough using as of penalising this incremental computation if

236
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,470
you this as

237
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,720
solve the problem

238
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,460
you're using this this is called the bootstrapping idea

239
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,960
so use your estimated values is that the true value because you don't have the

240
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,280
true values so you cannot use them

241
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,980
sample trust them using those values

242
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,350
in europe dates

243
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,160
so this might be unsound or some

244
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:18,070
but one thing is is that she so mimics value iteration so this is like

245
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,140
an incremental version of value iteration

246
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,970
so in value iteration you would really

247
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,880
just update

248
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,030
according to the expected value of the bootstrapping

249
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,720
so this value iteration this is just another way of writing by creation so you

250
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,130
do this in command of a iteration saying

251
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,820
so again dynamic programming is is strongly influencing the ideas here

252
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,550
and luckily what you can prove

253
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,710
is that

254
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,330
if you

255
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,090
use these are in a finite MDP are following a policy pi

256
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,100
and europe visiting pretty much every state

257
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:04,090
infinitely often and the learning rate of state something fairly by the way

258
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,480
from this it follows that you're visiting states in fact of

259
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:12,640
so you're learning which should be set to zero if not visiting state

260
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,610
and the

261
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,660
the sum of the squares of the learning rate is finite so these are called

262
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,200
the robbins monro conditions learning rates maybe you want to remember that it's used a

263
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,780
lot in this literature

264
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,660
so if you have these two conditions matter

265
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,960
then the sequence of a function is generated by this very simple target and he

266
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,160
it's called matching to define a function of p with probability one

267
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:47,380
so why is this manifold called TV medical devices called temporal difference method

268
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,910
because when

269
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,860
so the idea is that you have these areas

270
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,650
so that the the

271
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,210
an estimate

272
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,670
maybe you noise one of the true value and your current estimate you compute the

273
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,860
errors in your edits are based on that so you are trying to reduce that

274
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,430
so that's the idea of all these arguments

275
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,230
then you are plugging in as the prime minister the SPD

276
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:22,050
what you get years

277
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,400
glasgow times the

278
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,430
that x t plus one

279
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,410
minus the text

280
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,320
so that the BBC had actually use in europe

281
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,740
so i just planet

282
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,650
as the prime

283
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,150
and this is called the temporal difference

284
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,960
why because it computes an adder between successive time steps

285
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,280
here this is the value for

286
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,580
time step t and this is the value for times t plus one

287
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,640
so the the temporal difference

288
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,880
so the

289
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,180
you can prove this

290
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,500
conventions in various places i'm not going to go into the this because i have

291
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,760
much time if you're interested country

292
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:20,600
the question is efficient use one to color TV

293
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,410
so the advantage of TV is that it can be fully incremental

294
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,670
you can learn before knowing the final outcome before reaching the goal state so that

295
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,510
seems like a pretty good advantage if you

296
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,400
if you're problem doesn't happen goes this you don't really have a chance

297
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:41,780
other than that it uses less memory LSP computational and maybe these are not that

298
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,010
much interesting and this times

299
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,480
then computational power is just

300
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,680
trying like

301
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,390
chris rate

302
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,790
so the advantage of monte carlo is that well

303
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,100
this are given

304
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,950
might not work at all

305
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,670
if there is some sort of a violation of the more common assumption so

306
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,320
you call something as they but it's not really state

307
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,140
then these are my screw

308
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,110
and it could be a problem

309
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,670
and we'll see how that might have

310
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,980
but you want to decide about which are going to use that and what you

311
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,820
want to compare to the rate of convergence

312
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,170
and it turns out that well if you if you are in the situation where

313
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,110
you can tripl saga and so it's not because of candy the rate of convergence

314
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,870
is decided by the variance of the totality turned

315
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,100
so the various other proprietary small

316
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,510
the monte carlo could be better than the TV the variance of the totality turn

317
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,800
is large

318
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:54,390
then she the TD methods could be better than monte carlo

319
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,580
so one is the variance of

320
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,870
i thought that it turns small so there's an expression

321
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,280
so one example that we use a lot previously is that all the rewards as

322
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,580
a little

323
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,020
with me

324
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,960
when you reach the goal state

325
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,240
so that was one example

326
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,250
that was the port of this contd

327
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,890
on the return

328
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,140
it's bonded to be

329
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,490
two lie between zero and one right so

330
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,820
you don't have that many terms because

331
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,250
although the term suggests that you're summing up

332
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,170
so you have a single line multiplied by government to some power

333
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,640
so the very first of these is not going to be really high

334
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,810
so monte carlo could be a much better choice if you have such as war

335
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,940
on the other hand if there is more to advance

336
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,510
like at every time step you just receiving somebody war

337
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,240
could be positive or negative or whatever

338
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,660
then the TD at or could be much better because in that case the variance

339
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,030
the region could be much higher

340
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,740
so that's something to keep in mind if you want to choose between the two

341
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:16,970
in this situation of not having too many data treatment might be more appropriate and

342
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:22,090
he said before full bayesian treatment we need prior probability

343
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:29,470
the parameters under consideration in this case it is probably the prior probability of the

344
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,220
vector g given some hyperparameters i star

345
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,280
and the clinic that distribution to multinomial distribution is a discrete distribution

346
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,130
and it's like this give the distribution given

347
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:51,500
the set of parameters specifying usually distribution again is the normalisation term perhaps the product

348
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,330
of g to the k to the part of pakistan minus one

349
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,050
interestingly here the

350
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,300
likelihood function and

351
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,000
prior distribution very similar form

352
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,210
and we can think of this as being something like

353
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,260
trivalent collins

354
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,730
cool to our prior knowledge before we see any data

355
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,240
so this is now a function of

356
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:26,290
gene we have to specify here probability for

357
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,900
every combination of

358
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,960
settings of realizations of of tk and some of them will be more likely someone

359
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,840
some of them not being very likely and i've come to an intuitive

360
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:46,210
explanation of the formula in the moment first of all this is a number which

361
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,170
is non negative

362
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,530
but it doesn't have to integrate sum to one

363
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:57,940
so it's not normalized but sometimes it makes sense to normalize this quantity so we

364
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:03,780
calculate first the sum over all the first star case and then divide the first

365
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,590
i mean i first OK but by this time i not observe something which

366
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,630
now sums to one

367
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:18,570
so if we do this we can write this expression over here in the form

368
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:24,010
women now explicitly of the product of i've not for k

369
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:30,650
and this makes sense for many reasons one is that if we calculate the

370
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:36,210
the probability of observing a certain result in the task in the private sector i

371
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:42,400
first time we have to solve this into and we obtain the normalized quantity of

372
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:48,840
so if you do this normalisation by dividing by ivan not

373
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,380
we obtain the expected values

374
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,230
of what we would observe before we have seen in the data we just have

375
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,090
the i

376
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:05,190
stop parameter given and we do it we do it us then we would observe

377
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,860
these quantities

378
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,780
in terms of the probability

379
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,030
so so in

380
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:18,070
in some sense the i k indicate the distribution you expecting

381
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,280
and i have not put weight on the expectation so if have not very large

382
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,320
we have a strong about believe that these are the correct abilities not just a

383
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,030
small then we are not a certain about these probabilities and the problem is we

384
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,300
are certain about this other cases numbers normalized

385
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:47,230
we can also calculate the posterior distribution by sort of

386
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,690
applying this formula

387
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:53,670
to the product of the likelihood and the prior distribution the probability of the parameters

388
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,780
given the data and

389
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,170
a query parameters i first

390
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,440
it's again it usually distribution where

391
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,030
here we now have two at the first stars

392
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,380
with the corresponding columns

393
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,000
this is the property of this

394
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,500
the fact that we used

395
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,320
conjugate priors

396
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,260
one of the properties of the situation that the posterior takes on the same form

397
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,840
as prior with no surprise that the posterior distribution is also usually

398
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:30,900
and now we can calculate the probability of of the tasks of the next

399
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,820
given our prior assumption given the data

400
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,690
and again we can calculate the integral and the result is

401
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:44,510
very interesting very important it's quite definite facade plus nk normalized

402
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,030
what we see here is that if we

403
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,300
have observed

404
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:54,340
so now resides in the past they often the probability of observing this reside in

405
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,780
the future will be very high

406
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:03,510
and here we see also that i not exactly has this meaning of specifying the

407
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:10,920
belief in this prior assumptions about the distribution of acacia people like

408
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:16,440
so this is also quite an client intuitive there's

409
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,050
and of course you also observe the and becomes a very large we can sort

410
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:26,840
of ignore this time and again become tend to reside the same result we would

411
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,130
have obtained the maximum likelihood approach that the empirical collins

412
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:38,530
i determine the probabilities of future events

413
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:43,030
know we have to look to take a look at club level closer look at

414
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:48,110
this usually distribution which is has some interesting features

415
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,000
so this is the definition again

416
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,400
this formula without first past and now we can plug in different numbers this is

417
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,260
the case of the three-dimensional distribution c

418
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,110
plotting here two of the dimensions of the third one is the one of thought

419
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,030
orthogonal here for sort of this sort of thing you this is the place coming

420
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,670
if we specify

421
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,190
first of all it is one one one

422
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:22,210
and here's is one minus one so this is that due to the zero and

423
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,230
everything becomes a uniform so any

424
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,000
parameter value

425
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,440
so she has the same value in this case

426
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,650
then we can increase

427
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,300
i for not factor which means lighting these multiply these numbers with a large number

428
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,360
the two two two ten ten ten for example we see that the probability mass

429
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:50,630
gets more and more concentrated in the central region here which should be

430
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,780
situation point three and point three so

431
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:59,000
we we implementing our belief that we were dealing with a fair dice

432
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,570
all the probabilities of the same and the weight and this belief

433
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:09,880
also increases because the probability of this distribution point three point three becomes larger and

434
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,010
we could also implement an unbalanced prior belief

435
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:20,260
so this would indicate that you believe the second

436
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:27,550
the second reside in the person the dice would be very high probability the first

437
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,550
one is low and the

438
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,190
one would also below

439
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,690
and this is an example where

440
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,860
the third dimension is very high

441
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,560
i really like that

442
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,490
and so

443
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,370
it's the

444
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,280
on the

445
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:46,310
so much more reliable way

446
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,990
it's easy to find

447
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,720
OK so the

448
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,960
so this is the

449
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,600
optimisation you end up with a strategy

450
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,900
the decision problem and the reason why he should not be something

451
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,870
it's actually called

452
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,400
and people all these things

453
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,740
all that

454
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,010
now specializes in charge

455
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:40,060
she she found that

456
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:46,520
so i mean this is not my

457
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:52,000
is no

458
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,340
he has

459
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,570
this is a very high dimensional spaces efficient which

460
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:07,010
as already mentioned to read recently caption

461
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,580
some more specific examples of imagine

462
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,070
as vision of it based on

463
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,100
so if you want to select of the

464
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,580
in addition to the

465
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:26,840
the original input and not for that trick

466
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,820
well we

467
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
in the rule head of

468
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,690
features which is that this is the

469
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,040
five were that each

470
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,730
the truth the we

471
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:56,610
this is used to actually represent the fact that you

472
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,650
way as a combination

473
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,820
so if you try

474
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,250
five new example which is the way that we need

475
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,720
projection for example in the space

476
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,860
these are

477
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,590
it is

478
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,600
and just to

479
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,420
so i

480
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,990
actually not just in between training and test data

481
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,380
so this is the only known making

482
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,970
we need to do with

483
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,240
prior to compute efficiently

484
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,020
the three projections of

485
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,680
training and testing

486
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:44,940
he basically really want

487
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,500
should have computing

488
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,090
this composition the projection

489
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,800
together with the

490
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:59,400
you should we need to on the

491
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,850
and the same thing

492
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,470
that's we

493
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,840
just right

494
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,330
you the first one to

495
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,290
we seem to go back quite

496
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,020
two weeks ago

497
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,260
i was hard pressed

498
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,650
it's essentially the

499
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,860
and when try to solve

500
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,850
and you finally the norm for the way

501
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,800
in this space

502
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:47,780
this is all i

503
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,750
so actually

504
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,210
so what

505
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,570
so really all

506
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,950
however i well

507
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,420
and this is what

508
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,900
which is the

509
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,180
the expression the

510
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,280
the second one

511
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,210
this is actually the

512
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,070
problem of

513
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,700
and i

514
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:23,850
do you actually corresponds to the dual optimisation problem optimisation is actually

515
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,100
and the thing that we

516
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,890
do it

517
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,970
today we

518
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,960
projections of

519
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,850
we have efficient ways to compute

520
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,450
need actually

521
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:46,820
so that's the only so we did we decide is

522
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:52,520
you should be aware that we saw this situation

523
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,940
and we

524
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:59,570
i actually work

525
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,940
here's an example

526
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,340
so you actually

527
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,110
well i they all pairs of features

528
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,650
get your

529
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,080
in fact

530
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,810
and so on

531
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,270
is actually

532
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,230
from p one to two

533
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,270
all we get from the same

534
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:39,210
there is a high j

535
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,050
multiply correspond to make some

536
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,330
number sign just

537
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,940
more about this

538
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,370
this this is quite operation

539
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,500
so i would like to query

540
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,240
query operation then

541
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,990
it's the same thing here

542
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:26,190
much more efficient and this is the only one program

543
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,930
three years

544
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:51,030
you know the rules of operation it was six hundred one

545
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,620
so you see

546
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,440
we actually want to

547
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:04,770
o thing to do this

548
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,090
classification based

549
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,850
we actually yet

550
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,230
controlling generalisation

551
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:19,210
between the perturbation and if there is an instance oscillating at the coupling distillation freeze

552
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,270
and the photons travel to you

553
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,960
and you see an imprint of these fluctuations so

554
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,810
one important points to remember is that the for the rise the size of the

555
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,330
last scattering surface face

556
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:39,580
it's a very important quantity to keep in mind because it defines a fundamental more

557
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,730
these are sound waves

558
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:46,030
and you have a specific scale define which is the eyes and size of the

559
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:51,070
last scattering surface is a little bit like when you blow into upright

560
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:55,720
right you can create the fundamental modes and you can create overtones

561
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,400
and these are the kind of thing you should be able to see

562
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,560
in the past tense of those perturbations in the cosmic microwave background

563
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,650
so all this

564
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,140
o station going into the universe is cool enough to hydrogen combined for them can

565
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,420
travel freely to us and then was the father travel freely to us give us

566
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,650
an option of how this all

567
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,460
all this

568
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,950
acoustic oscillations were going on

569
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,630
and so all let means

570
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,000
keep through that and ask whether we can see this in the sky

571
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:28,200
and indeed we can this was produced by the wmap satellite in two thousand three

572
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,730
and all these

573
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,790
blood that you see hot and cold despite there is some small is the will

574
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,380
of the galaxy that have been taken out of the country difficult to well next

575
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,190
to the galactic center so what you seen you seen sounds

576
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,010
and this has been called the cosmic thing for

577
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:53,440
so for me when the first the particle accelerator with a maybe we're trying to

578
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,540
explain what physicists particle accelerators is like taking two grand piano this out of the

579
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:03,350
particles we have that we believe are complex and made the more fundamental particle smashing

580
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:07,150
them together and then what come out of the collision from there are trying to

581
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,660
figure out how the piano was made so what you are trying to do here

582
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,850
is from this sound

583
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:19,030
of the university of trying to figure out how the instrument is me

584
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,850
and so

585
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,950
let's see how this works

586
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,380
let's means

587
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,810
into another density

588
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,090
and then gravity takes over

589
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,600
the activation started growing up in the equation

590
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,390
galaxies and stars four min

591
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,350
gravity keeps you know

592
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,290
doing his job

593
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:48,350
and then you form the large-scale structure of the universe and when you satellite to

594
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:53,810
look at the last scattering surfaces sees it to all these cosmic structure in front

595
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,260
again we need to use some statistical property to describe all these and the idea

596
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,050
is to do of power spectrum of this temperature fluctuation but seems to now

597
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,480
you seen on the surface of the sphere because you have seen

598
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,830
on the plane of the sky

599
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,860
then you need to use the spherical harmonics and probably have you seen the spherical

600
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,950
before and this is a reminder of

601
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:26,680
what you've seen but you can always characterized then this small fluctuation over these three

602
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:33,400
kelvin temperature has an angular power spectrum now remember this is challenging because the temperature

603
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,250
of the cosmic background exactly kelvin but what you want to see

604
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,510
is the fluctuation that taverner mass of one part in ten to the five this

605
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,760
is really really challenging imagine how much you need to cool your detector in order

606
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,000
to be able to measure something like that

607
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,430
remember that the universe is so pervaded by

608
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,990
these kind of you

609
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:59,300
its top

610
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,070
let's keep going

611
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,310
this is what we've seen in the data the angular power spectrum as a function

612
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:13,820
of multiple moment the smaller scale larger scales

613
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:19,210
what you are seeing here is this fundamental model that was talking about things this

614
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:23,430
is the power spectrum is the square quantity compression satisfaction

615
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,590
it all looks like fixing here

616
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,290
so these correspond to compression this is the dissatisfaction this is the complexion and so

617
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:36,500
on and these are the acoustic peaks of this sounds of this cosmic symphony

618
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,130
so this is the fundamental mode

619
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,420
and these are primarily reports

620
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,460
why do i say that these are primordial reports

621
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,590
just the second mark

622
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,860
so all

623
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,210
this size correspond to this fundamental model which is the size of the eyes and

624
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,830
the last scattering surveys face

625
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:59,390
now you have a standard ruler if you can compute what was their eyes and

626
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:03,410
size of the last scattering cell face and you see on this skies appending a

627
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,960
given angle

628
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,370
remember there is a relation when you have some

629
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:12,260
a standard ruler and you see it and and angle you can learn about the

630
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:18,230
geometry of space in the middle withdrawal largest triangle uconn and so this position can

631
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:22,260
tell you about the geometry of the universe the height of this speak tell you

632
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,450
about the height of this potential well that tells you something about the matter content

633
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,910
of the universe

634
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,840
i remember whenever you have this sort of forced to dump oscillator

635
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,870
if you were to

636
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:41,960
leave the potential well the same but increases this masts then you've changed the relationship

637
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
so when i get there

638
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,380
the following i get omega s great

639
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,210
upstairs which is this one

640
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,330
and all this comes downstairs

641
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,310
my is only gets credit

642
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,600
because omega zero square

643
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,900
plus omega as query

644
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,080
we agree that the first equation i simply

645
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,000
written in c one divided by c two i can always do the right thing

646
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:10,150
is he wants to one side c two to one side and the fight

647
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,810
that space

648
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,790
and i'm going to do the same with the next iteration

649
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,960
i think this one two to right side and i have seen ones dan c

650
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,710
two see here

651
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,770
now this becomes up there

652
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:27,170
is omega

653
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,810
plus omega zero screen

654
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,290
please omega as script

655
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,750
and i go downstairs

656
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:39,040
omega as square

657
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,650
i have eliminated c one and c two

658
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,230
because if i solve this equation

659
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,250
i get my solution for me

660
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:51,650
is this one equation is one and only that's omega

661
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,190
gotta admit

662
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:57,540
and the about of the two solutions the better omega minus and the better be

663
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,880
omega plus coming out of this

664
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,810
untouched by human hands i must find two solutions

665
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,500
first make sure

666
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,920
this is correct

667
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,540
and the answer is yes

668
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,400
so what i do now

669
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,310
well i'm going to simplified one step further

670
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,940
which is not very easy

671
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,100
multiply this by this

672
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,250
this was this

673
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,600
so we get a omega s

674
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,020
to power four

675
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,960
is omega

676
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,170
because omega zero

677
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,750
because omega s creates

678
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,540
one equation

679
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,670
one another

680
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,850
you know

681
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,080
take the square root left and right

682
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,710
get minus

683
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,190
omega scrap

684
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:02,000
because omega zero create plays omega s great

685
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,880
or minus

686
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,480
as square

687
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,100
do not forget the plus or minus

688
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,640
the square root of

689
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,040
omega has two to four

690
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:21,000
this process might is omega as great

691
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,980
great see

692
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,870
the light of day you won't believe this

693
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,520
growing omega on the site

694
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,230
and i get omega zero square

695
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,670
because omega s great

696
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,420
minus class

697
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,120
omega as script

698
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,640
and the simplicity

699
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:45,330
is overpowering i feel it over my whole body

700
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,650
it is unbelievable

701
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,710
well they have a minus sign here

702
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,900
i find that omega is omega zero

703
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,460
that's my only go minus

704
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,850
that's the one

705
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,080
that's why omega minus

706
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,120
when there is a plus sign here

707
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,080
i find exactly what we predict before

708
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,520
i find it only got plus

709
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,190
is this square root

710
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,290
of omega zero

711
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,120
process two

712
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,710
omega s great

713
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,150
because the plus sign

714
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:21,420
make this too

715
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,750
and the beautiful

716
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,560
so they just pop out

717
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,060
and i predicted that there will be two solutions

718
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,100
we have both

719
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,420
so by substituting this in there

720
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,520
automatically come out two solutions

721
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,150
well now c one or c two

722
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:46,650
seven so for that

723
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,150
you can always sold in terms of riga

724
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:57,120
and in terms of c one obviously two

725
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,940
many volunteers look at the blackboard

726
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,060
somewhere in in those equations

727
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:08,780
that's repeated

728
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:09,960
three times

729
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:11,530
in one

730
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,570
get sent as one one-on-one

731
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:17,820
and we call this are three

732
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:22,700
and i expect you could call this repeating it twice because you send new repeated

733
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,860
price but i'm going call it repeating three times okay that's my

734
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,990
anne i made one of those earlier

735
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,070
and this is what it looks like

736
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,100
we've got a pilot ten thousand bits on the left and then we repeat it

737
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,370
three times i've actually reordered the bit so that first bit is sent

738
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,560
after the whole file has been sent

739
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,060
we repeat the whole file three times

740
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,540
logically just the same as repeating it

741
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,450
let's give ourselves a source file

742
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:58,570
and the full file could be the string zero one one zero one

743
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,890
and transmit

744
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,290
zero zero zero one long

745
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,050
there is one one

746
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,030
so that's how we encode the file

747
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,590
let's not give ourselves from noise and start talking about

748
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,220
and will start with a repetition code

749
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,240
so let's have a noise vector and the whale represent noises can be zero if

750
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,860
no flip occurs in the can one flip

751
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,120
so here's the noise vector that are

752
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,880
binary symmetric channel

753
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,600
could produce forest

754
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,260
and that would mean that the received vector

755
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,000
differs from tea

756
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,550
in some of these places so the hero

757
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:55,300
this was split so we get a zero one one

758
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,730
one one one

759
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,320
one zero one

760
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:01,920
so that's our received

761
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,650
so what i do there i added

762
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,060
the transmission

763
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,160
the nice and i did the addition modulo

764
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,980
two so one and one is zero

765
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,310
how should we decode this

766
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:23,490
the decoder

767
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,380
a system that reads in

768
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,300
and speaks out against

769
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,550
four tests

770
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:37,260
in general

771
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:38,810
how should we

772
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,640
of three have a habitat you neighbour

773
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,850
okay any suggestions

774
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:55,610
how in general yes so back

775
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,450
okay so take the mean

776
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,200
at each group of three is our main so really real time

777
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:06,810
andy say

778
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,380
is the mean above it close to the one or two zero

779
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:16,520
is did anyone else have another way of putting the same concept yeah

780
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:20,640
best-of-three all majority vote yes so

781
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,970
we reckon that sensible decoder is

782
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:27,670
the best of

783
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,210
here three

784
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,370
and the length of this block transmitting

785
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,280
or majority vote

786
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:55,860
right so we receive zero zero zero we say zero activities zero one which they one

787
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,530
if you actually one zero

788
00:47:59,030 --> 00:47:59,680
we what

789
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:02,720
they want

790
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:04,430
and see the

791
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:05,460
want to say

792
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,060
to chip if i make a

793
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:16,760
okay so studies eight possible received vectors and here's what we do according to this

794
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,210
decoder and if we apply the decoder here

795
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:22,130
then our comes at a zero

796
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,180
and what we can notice in this case

797
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:33,610
is that some good things that happened

798
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,320
so here

799
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:36,820
i flip occurred

800
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,270
with the flat

801
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,090
and it's been cleaned up

802
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,330
because this is the same as this

803
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,070
and so that makes us happy

804
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,840
something else has happened

805
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,150
there are two flats in a block

806
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:57,180
and this has been done one and that's actually an error so that's not good

807
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:59,320
so a bit sad about

808
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:02,060
fair enough

809
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:04,310
this decoder

810
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,880
does improve things

811
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,560
if we apply the majority vote decoder

812
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,220
this is what we get

813
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:16,580
and if you compare thee

814
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,160
this source file and these

815
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:21,820
decoded file there

816
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,330
you can see it's improve things we have reduced the probability of error so this

817
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:29,660
repetition code kind words a bit

818
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,320
but it doesn't actually get

819
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,020
just ten to the minus fifteen

820
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:34,830
he is

821
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,660
some value k

822
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,830
he's fifteen say

823
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,160
lancelot fifteen

824
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,020
if the element is there

825
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:44,560
as the elements

826
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,470
it's not in the set

827
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,430
it's now

828
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,500
a very simple data structure

829
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,190
just go to that

830
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,510
and set the value

831
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,700
to the inserted value for deletion just from here to looking up

832
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:04,060
just index and see if see what's and that's what

833
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,760
very simple

834
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,500
very simple data structures

835
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:13,500
all these operations therefore

836
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,970
in the worst case

837
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:25,670
as a practical matter

838
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:30,120
places you can use this strategy are pretty limited

839
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,030
why is wise

840
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,860
what's the issue limitation here

841
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,750
OK so it so that's the limitation surely

842
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,760
but there's actually more severe limitation

843
00:50:49,130 --> 00:51:05,170
was that i started writing

844
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:14,270
minus one can be a huge number

845
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,950
OK like for example

846
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:21,050
suppose that i want to have my set drawn over sixty four bit

847
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:28,220
OK the things i'm storing in my table is set of sixty four numbers

848
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:31,030
so maybe small set

849
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,150
we only have

850
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,740
you know

851
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:37,080
a few thousand of these elements

852
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:42,300
but there are drawn from the sixty four bit value then this strategy requires me

853
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,990
to have an array that goes from zero

854
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:49,350
two of the sixty four minus one

855
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,600
i think it was sixty four minus one

856
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,590
it is like eighteen

857
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:59,390
twenty million of

858
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,100
things like

859
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:04,870
it's it's literally because it's like it's beyond the

860
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,820
billions we normally use OK

861
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:11,490
another billion or trillions

862
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:15,830
point eighteen twenty million case that's the really big number

863
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,610
so or even worse

864
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:22,690
suppose that is were drawn from character strings

865
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:27,040
so you know people's names or something which is the optimal way to have to

866
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,210
because most of the table would be empty be for any reasonable

867
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,520
set of values you would want to keep

868
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,960
so the idea is to try to keep something is going to keep the table

869
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,040
while still

870
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:42,370
preserving some of the property

871
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,420
and that's where hashing comes in

872
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,880
we use the hash functions

873
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,730
which maps

874
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:09,200
during the course not crazy random

875
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,350
in two slots

876
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,900
table t

877
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:19,210
so we call it should be

878
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:22,770
each of the array

879
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:24,720
indexes here slot

880
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:27,490
this seem just sort of think of it is a big table you got slots

881
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:28,520
in the tail

882
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,370
restoring your values

883
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,820
and so

884
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,940
university's school that you

885
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:43,320
we have our table over here

886
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,970
we set up

887
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,800
he has

888
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:56,870
m slots

889
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,380
it could take

890
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:05,650
we actually have been set we're actually try to represent us

891
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,380
which is presumably a very small

892
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,060
piece of

893
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:12,660
the universe

894
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,730
and i will do as well

895
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:19,110
take an element from here and map two

896
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,520
it's a to their

897
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,450
can take another one

898
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,870
we apply

899
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,680
the hash functions

900
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:32,350
one was is that we characterize exactly stability clear k means

901
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:36,680
we know

902
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:39,240
what it detects

903
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:41,330
and we conclude that the

904
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:47,660
the success of stability in practice is only coincidence it is not a general rule

905
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:52,640
so it's a very funny situation with something works in practice it also some very

906
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,520
artificial that when you analyse mathematically

907
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:03,220
but the the characterisation and argue that this characterization shows that stability should not work

908
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,660
in general so

909
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,100
he was the characterization

910
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:12,520
we said that a stable if at the limit the sample size n goes to

911
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:15,790
it because the instability becomes ill

912
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:20,640
so that they stable when you take large sample sizes it becomes more and more

913
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:21,830
of them

914
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,100
and we could prove the following

915
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:29,350
that if your algorithm is cost minimizing like k means you're trying to minimize the

916
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:34,020
k means cost that's what your algorithm is striving to get it at the cost

917
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,680
minimizing i would

918
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,540
it is stable on a data set d

919
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,430
if and only if there is a unique minimizer

920
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:44,640
two the function you're trying to optimise

921
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:49,310
if and only if there is a unique partition that achieves

922
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:54,390
the optimal value so rather than finding the correct number of clusters it detects whether

923
00:55:54,410 --> 00:56:00,270
there is a unique optimum solution several optimal solutions is if we go back

924
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,970
if you go back to this picture

925
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:05,140
here if k equal to that many

926
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:09,370
possible partitionings that will give you the same k means but

927
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:13,350
but here for k was to be the only one partitioning gives you

928
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,220
the minimum value of k means

929
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:21,080
and what we found out disability exactly the text this thing the question whether there

930
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,890
is an optimal

931
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:25,910
unique optimum solution o

932
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:33,470
multiple optimal solutions and now we can i ask ourselves so

933
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:45,490
i would say that said the for is the probability distribution over some domain

934
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:47,740
and that many

935
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:53,180
could be infinite to find probabilities we know so the main you can think of

936
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:56,520
it as the a fundamental uniform distribution if you want

937
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:00,220
and then the question is you're trying to optimise some

938
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:03,160
cause instability detects just is now

939
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,100
i don't think i have time to go into the proof

940
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,490
i mean this is the proof idea

941
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,560
and the idea of showing you the proof is just

942
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,830
convincing you

943
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:17,870
that this is hard proof so you should accept it too

944
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,850
whatever your content is the proof is hard

945
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,410
OK so

946
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:24,850
what what is the conclusion

947
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:28,180
the common belief

948
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:33,240
why that a is stable on the distribution p if and only if the algorithm

949
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,220
picks the correct number of clusters

950
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,180
that was the common belief that was really the way

951
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,620
being applied to all of

952
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,020
many domains

953
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:57,790
the stability is only a necessary condition

954
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:00,970
for good clustering not sufficient condition for class

955
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,310
OK you right

956
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:10,820
it's only necessary condition now what i would do it is

957
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:14,150
i have what we have is complete characterization

958
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,100
and if there is that you know

959
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:18,570
if you if you are

960
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:25,350
is trying to minimize some notion of cost somewhat defined notion of course then

961
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:31,150
a is stable on p if and only if there is a unique solution unique

962
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,320
solution for this dataset

963
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,890
so we have a complete characterisation of what be

964
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,890
and the question is

965
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:44,220
these two notions is saying is correct k

966
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,610
the same thing as saying we have a unique solution

967
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:52,530
and we already seen one example where it doesn't and i can show you now

968
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:59,070
some more examples which really show that it can go wrong in many many ways

969
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,570
so here are some

970
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,190
very simple example so

971
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,570
assume that all the time in my examples now so now

972
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:09,190
what i want to do is show you an example that those two notions of

973
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,860
correct number of clusters and having a unique minimizer for the

974
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:16,780
cost function are not the same

975
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:20,790
here is an example of a simple example all my data sets will be on

976
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:26,650
the line and these are just the density function field density function is fifty percent

977
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:29,520
of that is here and fifty percent of that is here

978
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,690
what you think is the correct number of clusters

979
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:37,080
if i try k was there will be stable

980
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,280
because there is a unique solution

981
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:41,570
so if they can try

982
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:46,620
so sentences stable because the unique optimum solution what happens if i try cake was

983
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,540
would it be

984
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:52,930
stable it will not be stable because

985
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:55,080
we have to

986
00:59:55,100 --> 01:00:00,570
sufficient x same course meaning optimizes this is one of the most

987
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,720
and another optimisation

988
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,140
is this one

989
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,280
both of them achieved the same cost

990
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,860
so i i have

991
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,500
nine numerical optimize

992
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,140
OK was three

993
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,640
so the conclusion is

994
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:19,560
three is not is unstable too stable instability did a good job

995
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:26,230
four former is going to be stable again you know that the that

996
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:31,240
pushing my next example right right before the stable again right so far maybe good

997
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,890
here's another example now i changed my example only a little bit i put here

998
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:42,610
fifty percent plus epsilon of my weight and here put fifty percent minus epsilon

999
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,190
of my weight now

1000
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:48,150
we can see what's the correct number of clusters we will agree that this two

1001
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:51,830
with k equal to will be stable or not

1002
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:54,430
it will be stable if i just have to points

1003
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:58,830
it would be stable there's only one optimum solution one in the center what will

1004
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:01,060
happen for k three

1005
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:06,530
it would be stable for k tray because OK constraint we have a unique optimum

1006
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:11,900
solution we have put the two here in the one because this highly

1007
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:15,030
a weight so we see here that

1008
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:19,760
if i use stability is my indicator to what the correct number

1009
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:24,150
clusters can distinguish between two and three although

1010
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,480
in terms of our intuition

1011
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,770
two and three are clearly distinguishable there's no argument here

1012
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,580
are on average more similar to each other

1013
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:36,250
each is through its own cluster

1014
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,450
i want to be the case that

1015
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:40,530
so it's not the case that this guy

1016
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,310
is more similar to here and there

1017
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:47,880
and this guy is more similar to their

1018
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:50,260
so if you think of the similarity

1019
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,410
i think it's helpful to think of similarity attraction

1020
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:57,830
OK i don't want this to be more attracted to this set here and this

1021
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:03,400
that the more attractive than here i go off together to form

1022
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:07,930
the stable marriage is like this pair

1023
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:14,630
so that the conditioning what they might be natural one similarity function has the property

1024
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:18,430
so similarity measure the proper is like a piece of one cluster in peace another

1025
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:22,450
cluster both more similar to each other and each is to the

1026
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,180
so that turns out to be weaker condition and the first one was still sufficient

1027
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:30,030
to get bigotry although in this case you can use the same out

1028
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:34,920
i really here is just a simpler version of this where

1029
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:42,350
the stable marriage condition is it's OK if this guy wants to run with this

1030
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,530
guys guidelines this one doesn't want to to have that or vice versa but is

1031
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:49,700
the same in either one side conditions and nobody wants to run off with any

1032
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:53,330
each that's more to this

1033
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,960
there's more to k

1034
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:57,410
you might say the average similarity

1035
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:00,260
a this is more similar to this

1036
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:04,700
and here and then also require this is more similar

1037
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,170
this is simple addition

1038
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:12,130
it turns out for this case actually for the case in the last slide instead

1039
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:13,420
of the the

1040
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:20,810
cross called the standard single linkage and average single linkage works so

1041
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:27,430
the here and now with the work is the like before but instead of merging

1042
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:28,330
taking the

1043
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:32,110
the two most similar points emerging clusters we took to another way to think of

1044
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:37,160
the previous algorithm is free clusters we define their similarity to be the max overall

1045
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:41,340
points here all points here the similar now define to be the average is this

1046
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:47,380
more similar the average someone will merge pair of clusters whose average similarity is highest

1047
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:50,720
if we do that then you can show this to sell more

1048
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:54,940
and you can analyse any point in time all the across you produced are what's

1049
01:03:54,940 --> 01:04:00,000
called laminar with target they're all either pieces of the target cluster or there

1050
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:03,860
equal to the power posterior for the union

1051
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,100
i'm not going to do the analysis

1052
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,400
done the proof

1053
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:17,720
but it turns out this version

1054
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:22,430
the interesting thing just kind of q is that if you have a similarity function

1055
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:25,430
it's not symmetric

1056
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:28,880
then this algorithm breaks down

1057
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:30,510
right and so

1058
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:35,380
give an example showing how breaks down so nonsymmetric also i think is you might

1059
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:40,000
think why should you ever have a similarity function is not symmetric

1060
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:44,780
so i find a OK you might like if you think this attraction

1061
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,310
a you've seen before i extracted the fact see is that the

1062
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:55,000
he fact a

1063
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,820
doesn't even light cycle

1064
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:01,080
nothing wrong with looks like

1065
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,590
so then the algorithm can break down so you have an example of how can

1066
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:11,510
break down so imagine you're similarity for like

1067
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:15,630
OK so

1068
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:26,270
imagine that this has point

1069
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:32,430
so imagine that this a similarity from this to this the corner here here's quarter

1070
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:37,140
this is only point one similar to here at this point five somewhere here is

1071
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:41,740
perfectly consistent there's no piece that wants to join piece

1072
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:47,020
but symmetric and the problem is that this average similarity is higher than this one

1073
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:50,880
so the average similarity thing with merge this with this which wasn't we want to

1074
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:55,320
so it turns out that you can do something all the difference in this case

1075
01:05:55,620 --> 01:06:00,590
you can run out elements inspired by the minimum spanning tree algorithm corporate because out

1076
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:01,790
where what you do

1077
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:06,060
it's very cluster you look at very piece you have in your algorithm

1078
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,940
you currently have u

1079
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:12,310
pointed to the piece is most similar so do that this piece points to hear

1080
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:16,640
the piece point here piece points to here he is walking to get into cycle

1081
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,440
everybody's playing somewhere you have to go into cycle to start somewhere in all the

1082
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:24,850
errors while you're sitting in the cycle the can prove that legitimate thing to merge

1083
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:28,120
so that's a slightly different

1084
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:31,120
then we can look at more general conditions so if you

1085
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,550
take the previous one

1086
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:37,130
we're quite stability but if we imagine there are similar function might be noisy maybe

1087
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:41,210
there are small sets the tone of a and hopefully the large sets still and

1088
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:45,510
then you can look at different algorithms for this property we don't know if that's

1089
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:48,280
we know flow algorithm and fast

1090
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:54,580
if we took examples as in the previous property and noise large set still behave

1091
01:06:56,670 --> 01:07:01,110
bottom-up algorithms start from p says might fail because they might make bad decisions at

1092
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,120
the beginning

1093
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,860
we know is slow algorithm that works here which is you start taking some points

1094
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:11,600
random you guess what topics they belong to and use that to produce candidate cost

1095
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:13,420
and the reason the are

1096
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:16,770
we have slowed to its is depends on how many

1097
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:21,990
topics there are with the exponential number of topics career take initial sample guess what

1098
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:26,020
topics they belong to use that to produce candidate clusters and so we have to

1099
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:29,000
try a bunch of different possibilities the into

1100
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,380
trial but cannot clusters to produce a huge list of candidates and then the second

1101
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:39,010
testing step that will compare these and see the extent to which search

1102
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:44,610
conditions implied by this property is satisfied if things up into a tree

1103
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:48,670
so so the running time for depends on top if you're talking like two topic

1104
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:55,990
three topic not so bad but this algorithm ends up being exponential time

1105
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,750
OK and so

1106
01:07:57,770 --> 01:07:59,850
just to and

1107
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:04,450
if you're familiar with the pack model and learning in the PAC learning model we

1108
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:08,670
try to study are quite sets of functions a concept class like

1109
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,160
the set of

1110
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:15,570
conjunctions and functions or linear separators or

1111
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:19,750
degree two polynomial the decision trees decision unless you look at the set of function

1112
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:22,700
and you say d which is the set of functions are learnable and by what

1113
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:28,380
algs twenty minutes as i believe the world is and function without actually i believe

1114
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,110
the world linear separator

1115
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:35,020
the target functions were separated without actions by believe the target function is small

1116
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:41,270
think of an example suppose i've got this way for silicon we've talked about doping

1117
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:45,540
talked about doping suppose i want to render it p type so i want to

1118
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,620
as i want to

1119
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:50,810
confuse this with a surveillance

1120
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:54,680
open such as boron so how do we do that we smear this with boron

1121
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,870
and just wait

1122
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,460
what's the process

1123
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:01,750
let's take a look more closely what we can do is is we can take

1124
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:02,960
our wafer

1125
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:06,570
i'm going to exaggerate the dimensions is colloquially hockey partner

1126
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:10,940
the silicon wafer so here's the silicon or to put this in a furnace and

1127
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:14,570
we want to get boron into the wafer and we're not going to do this

1128
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:15,790
by melting

1129
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:19,880
we're going to do this while the wafer is in the solid state that's why

1130
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:24,440
we're over here talking about diffusion in a solid state process

1131
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,860
what we do is

1132
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:33,520
a form of boron over the way for

1133
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:35,880
as the gas di boring

1134
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:41,120
and the di boring passes over and on contact with the silicon

1135
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:43,050
it decomposes to form

1136
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,120
which goes into the silicon

1137
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:47,770
plus hydrogen

1138
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:51,350
and that hydrogen course remains in the gas phase

1139
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:56,240
and we can even moderate cost because the chemical reactions decomposition and i boring into

1140
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:01,080
hydrogen and boron and we could even take a guess that maybe the rate of

1141
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:04,750
this i haven't measured but the rate would go as some

1142
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,870
a relationship involving the concentration

1143
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:11,560
di boring to some power and

1144
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,140
so we've seen that

1145
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:17,800
now what i want to do someone asked what what's the process by which boron

1146
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,390
enters the cell

1147
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,780
so now i want to zoom in here to the

1148
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:26,320
to the near surface and here's the free surface of silica

1149
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:30,390
this is the surface this is the inside the wafer

1150
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:37,740
and i've got boron the decomposing and dissolving riggo's in substitution only sitting on silicon

1151
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:41,430
sites so now i'm asking how does the boron

1152
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:44,120
how does boron into the cell

1153
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,000
what are the kinetics of the

1154
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,490
in graphs of boron

1155
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:53,530
that's what we want to as rate ingress

1156
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:56,080
rate ingress of boron

1157
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:58,830
through selection

1158
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,230
russell as we wanna look

1159
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,820
this is not some kind of a cooperative process

1160
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:12,050
because the silicon solid so individual atoms have to move step by step through because

1161
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:15,370
it's substitutional solutions forming here

1162
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:19,120
we can take a guess at it

1163
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:20,140
if i know

1164
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:23,000
make this the coordinate system

1165
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:26,380
make this the coordinate system called the free surface

1166
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,260
x equals zero

1167
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,540
and this is

1168
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:32,070
moving down into greater

1169
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,650
i can make a plot of

1170
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:38,520
ingress of

1171
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:43,260
born into silicon so this is the next which is depth from surface

1172
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,710
this is the free surface

1173
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:48,110
at x equals zero

1174
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:52,580
and i'm going to fix the concentration of di boring in the

1175
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:58,370
reactor so the concentration of boron at the surface will be fixed

1176
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:02,820
as long as they keep the concentration of died boring fixed concentration of boron the

1177
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:06,530
surface will be fixed so what i'm going to do is to plot the concentration

1178
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,780
of boron into silicon

1179
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,460
as a function of depth from the surface

1180
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:15,050
we know deep inside the silicon there's no more

1181
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:19,030
so here it should be zero we know what the surface is constant the question

1182
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:21,920
is what is the shape of the curve

1183
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:24,000
just as i showed you last day

1184
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:28,780
we talked about the first or second order what it boils down to is what

1185
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:33,320
is the shape of the curve we know it's going look something like this

1186
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,010
doesn't look a lot like

1187
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:38,570
the attenuation curve for

1188
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:43,030
the loss of matter in the chemical reactions

1189
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:48,740
it starts some constant value trails off asymptotically so really the question is what is

1190
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,390
the shape

1191
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,380
what is the shape

1192
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:57,170
are we answer that question we can look at this and i instead what we

1193
01:12:57,170 --> 01:13:00,810
y two w

1194
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:03,090
my so by

1195
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:06,360
by multiplying three matrices together

1196
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:12,210
a nested so so the out of some of some of the y two

1197
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:15,150
the inner sum is some of the y one

1198
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:19,270
but that's just what i mean by double so some of the y one and

1199
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,580
y two

1200
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,960
and i have

1201
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:27,080
inside the sum i have the exponential of the g one function plus the g

1202
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,220
two function plus the g three function

1203
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:36,140
so by multiplying three matrices together

1204
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:39,000
i'm summing over all y one y two

1205
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,340
well if i am i

1206
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:48,750
and i can continue

1207
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,560
so i can

1208
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,760
if i have multiplied together

1209
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:57,970
all the matrices one two three up to n plus one

1210
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,160
and i can

1211
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:06,080
look at the start

1212
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:11,330
entry of this

1213
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,330
combined matrix

1214
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,230
it's going to be

1215
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:25,240
of the y one

1216
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:28,000
after y and

1217
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,760
the exponential of

1218
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:37,680
g one start

1219
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,380
what one

1220
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:41,000
class g two

1221
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,540
one y two

1222
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:44,900
g three

1223
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,860
y two y three

1224
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:50,250
so on

1225
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:51,360
up to

1226
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:56,580
g and plus one

1227
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:00,470
y and

1228
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:09,520
and and

1229
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,810
this summer

1230
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:22,530
this is exactly the thing that i wanted to evaluate for the partition function

1231
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:24,880
it's the sum of

1232
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,350
all possible

1233
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:30,560
assignments for the individual y i of

1234
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,150
all of the numerator

1235
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:39,330
for those particular y i

1236
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:40,880
and and so

1237
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:44,980
this algorithm is that the the the previous our that has

1238
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:49,210
well as the name the viterbi algorithm and has a category of algorithms that falls

1239
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:53,380
into the dynamic programming and this algorithm

1240
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:57,560
the way i presented it

1241
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:01,580
it's a matrix multiplication already so to do to implement it all you need to

1242
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:05,140
do is create is an matrices and then multiply them altogether

1243
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:08,260
so that's computationally very easy

1244
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:11,700
it's so much

1245
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,340
it's actually

1246
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:18,960
we a special case of a more general class of algorithms called forward backward algorithms

1247
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:23,480
and i guess i'm not going to try to explain why this is called forward

1248
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:27,130
backward algorithm that if you have

1249
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:32,400
if you're familiar with hidden markov models they have forward backward algorithm also and what

1250
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:38,880
explaining here is just a very very narrow special cases solves exactly the problem we

1251
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,980
are interested in solving here

1252
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:43,510
but still this is still general for

1253
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:47,260
a linear chain conditional random fields

1254
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:00,400
those are the

1255
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:04,400
those are the two important and that we needed we want to use conditional random

1256
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:10,520
now we need to talk about training conditional random fields

1257
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:13,250
any questions on the

1258
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,450
going to use them

1259
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:38,360
stochastic gradient

1260
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:42,030
the second or as and the maximisation

1261
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:44,380
so much

1262
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,400
so much so

1263
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:49,230
the model

1264
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:53,880
as a log PY given x w

1265
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,120
it is

1266
01:17:55,260 --> 01:18:01,930
so we have the normalisation constant

1267
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:10,670
of some of the j

1268
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:14,830
my fj

1269
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:17,260
x y

1270
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,900
and so to them

1271
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:27,880
to do stochastic gradient we need to evaluate the derivative of my

1272
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:31,030
this so this is the log probabilities so

1273
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:36,520
that's the objective function to maximize for single training example so we want to evaluate

1274
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,000
its derivative

1275
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,280
model so

1276
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,260
i did wj

1277
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:47,340
log p

1278
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,320
OK sorry so

1279
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:56,450
this is the p function

1280
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:59,690
so only the log functional log of this

1281
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:02,290
and what i want to do now is the

1282
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:05,940
derivative of the log p function

1283
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:10,370
and so the log of this is the logo of the numerator minus along with

1284
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,560
the nominator

1285
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,920
divided wj

1286
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:21,700
some of the j

1287
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:23,730
wj j

1288
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:26,260
x y

1289
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:32,000
divided wj

1290
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,270
xeon x

1291
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:40,230
what's this

1292
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:46,870
so i suppose we have which required three

1293
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:49,850
and value x want to insert

1294
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,350
it is the algorithm

1295
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:56,330
first we instantly pst you know

1296
01:19:56,350 --> 01:20:01,690
then we color the red herring

1297
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:04,250
is slightly more precise notation

1298
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:07,080
color field x

1299
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:14,620
and our and walk away up the tree with a while so we get to

1300
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:18,480
the root or

1301
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,520
until we reach a black

1302
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:31,500
so in general x initially is going to be the elements that we inserted but

1303
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,960
we're going to move x up the tree if ever we find xs of black

1304
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:38,270
nodes were happy because maybe it's turns red

1305
01:20:38,290 --> 01:20:43,080
maybe it is and i don't care black can have arbitrarily coloured parents threaten as

1306
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,270
that we worry about

1307
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:48,160
so x is red we have to keep doing this

1308
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:54,120
further around one while the color is red

1309
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,710
we're going to keep doing this

1310
01:20:55,790 --> 01:21:01,620
so there are three cases

1311
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:06,140
well there are six thing and her account that's what makes this a little bit

1312
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:07,250
tricky too

1313
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,710
OK but there are

1314
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:17,060
some symmetric

1315
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:26,750
what we care about argued is between x

1316
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:29,100
and it's grandparents

1317
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:34,520
so i'm using POV student parent of x shorter so p of p of xis

1318
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,520
xis grandparent

1319
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:40,230
left of p if you have access the left child so what i'm interested as

1320
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:42,020
i look at x

1321
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:46,310
and if i don't sign any directions in x is the child of some convex

1322
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:52,140
p of x is the parent of is the child of the grandparent here p

1323
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:53,210
of x

1324
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:57,670
now these edges are vertical there either left or right and i care about which

1325
01:21:57,690 --> 01:21:58,850
in particular

1326
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:04,020
i'm looking at whether the parents is the left child of the grandparents

1327
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,170
so i want to know

1328
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:06,730
does it look like

1329
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:17,660
and i don't know whether x is to the left or to the right of

1330
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:21,480
the parent is a parent of x the left child here p of x

1331
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,390
or is it the right child

1332
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:29,290
in these two cases are totally symmetric but i need to assume it's one way

1333
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:32,580
or the other one other otherwise i can draw the pictures

1334
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,960
so this will be

1335
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,770
it's called category

1336
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,060
this is category b

1337
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:44,170
and i'm going to tell you what to do in category a and category b

1338
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:47,000
is symmetric just flip left and right

1339
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:48,310
so this

1340
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:52,100
this is a

1341
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:58,960
within category a there are three cases

1342
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:03,690
i would think it would be is the same case is just reversed

1343
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:07,290
well we're going to do

1344
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:10,250
is look at the other child

1345
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:11,750
of the grandparents

1346
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:19,520
this is one reason why we certainly need know

1347
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:21,000
which way we're lucky

1348
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:25,060
if one of x is the left child of the grandparent going look at the

1349
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:29,350
other child parent grandparent which would be the right child of the grandparent call that

1350
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:31,060
node y

1351
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:34,690
this is also known as the uncle or the art of x depending on whether

1352
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:36,090
the origin

1353
01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:39,030
that is

1354
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:43,560
defined here in terms of articulatory features

1355
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:48,210
and so i have done in the lower left-hand corner

1356
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:49,670
here the

1357
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:53,470
these sort of the key here is that each that each state

1358
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:59,520
it is defined by sort of the presence or the level

1359
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:03,910
of a multi valued articulatory feature

1360
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:11,020
so the articulatory features here are some of the the

1361
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,260
i guess

1362
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:17,550
different from the elements that we talked about earlier and in terms of their specifics

1363
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:22,420
but the let's the tongue body of the tongue dorsum and the the valley and

1364
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:25,700
the larynx so these are sort of the articulatory positions

1365
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:30,390
and i guess lyrics would have to do with voicing and so on

1366
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:35,290
so for each i will withdraw and this figure is a little sort of an

1367
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:40,930
example of what they'd intended that is the yellow one yellow box here corresponds to

1368
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:42,060
the phoneme t

1369
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:48,500
the other corresponds to the phoneme and i have a each one of these sort

1370
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:54,500
of squares or rectangles here is a represents a state of the model

1371
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:57,360
in and each state is characterized by

1372
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:58,760
the level

1373
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,320
of the feature for of the distinctive feature

1374
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,720
houses houses arrived at well by hand

1375
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:08,050
the designers

1376
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:14,330
basically i went through their own and specified sort of micro segmental features

1377
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,770
and you can see for example that for t

1378
01:25:18,170 --> 01:25:20,010
oh i forgot to mention here

1379
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:23,960
this allows for speech at feature spreading

1380
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:29,860
this indicates the are nine here indicates that the influence here of the

1381
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:36,430
this tongue dorsum that value over at the right is allowed to spread into into

1382
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:42,340
the states l one would indicate that the time that the tongue body value of

1383
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:45,750
one hears is can spread into the state so

1384
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,130
so basically the notion of

1385
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:55,060
of of

1386
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:59,020
assimilation we we talked about how context can spread from one

1387
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:03,190
one forward to the next is characterized here

1388
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,440
and i guess

1389
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:12,570
we were basically allowing context to be directly defined in our articulatory space

1390
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:15,730
what are some of the potential advantages here

1391
01:26:15,730 --> 01:26:20,550
well one in particular is that we could think of before going to do that

1392
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:23,670
we've discussed this earlier for going to do adaptation

1393
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:30,420
we can perhaps do that very efficiently we can adapt along this particular articulatory dimension

1394
01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:36,800
most schemes that we do in way that we implement for adaptation in existing systems

1395
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:44,820
of apply some kind of perhaps the matrix transformation or maximum capacity or a assumption

1396
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:49,190
and updating the means and variances model but they

1397
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:52,510
can be inefficient and that they may require a lot of data

1398
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:58,590
part of that is because they're not really adapting along any sort of physiologically plausible

1399
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:02,770
OK this makes sense

1400
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:13,520
right so

1401
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:18,210
think of them as it states of your hidden markov model

1402
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:21,830
that's right decision would any other hidden markov model

1403
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,470
kind of

1404
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:27,080
yes exactly right

1405
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:28,140
think of it that way

1406
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:33,780
so we're not so that's the key thing here where you got your system sitting

1407
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:38,280
over here in your desktop and there it is and and how would you have

1408
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:42,600
to change a system to implement this well the first thing is you completely redefined

1409
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,510
the topology of models you're incorporating

1410
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:49,950
as shown here you incorporated mechanism to allow

1411
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:55,910
you know states here two to migrate is shown this that that is a bit

1412
01:27:55,910 --> 01:28:02,200
of a change in the other so you wind up then with the state space

1413
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,910
here that's described in terms of

1414
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:08,520
these articulatory sort of

1415
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:15,190
and then but otherwise you have real you haven't changed your hmm system

1416
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:17,600
in in a significant way

1417
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:21,670
so the so the thought is that while the state you know the

1418
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:28,410
you're you're existing hmm system has states in the hidden states could associate with each

1419
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:31,390
other and you don't really have a way of

1420
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:33,730
saying what those states represents

1421
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:37,010
you can kind of in hindsight go back and look and say well look if

1422
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:40,730
i decode the state tends to correspond to this

1423
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:42,970
you know this general

1424
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:47,210
spectral a homogenous phenomenon but that's about it

1425
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:49,290
so the idea here is you can say all right

1426
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:54,010
i'm really as i move to my state space i'm really moving through say

1427
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:57,350
as we want you to be able to use the basic tools of computational thinking

1428
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:59,970
to write small-scale programs

1429
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:04,910
keep coming back to that idea call computational thinking

1430
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:10,720
and so you can write small pieces of code

1431
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:14,150
small is not derogatory or by the way just says the size of things are

1432
01:29:14,150 --> 01:29:15,220
going to be able to do

1433
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,610
second skill we want you to have at the end of this course is the

1434
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:21,790
ability to use the vocabulary of computational tools

1435
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,280
in order to be able to understand programs written by others

1436
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,840
want to be able to write going to be able to read

1437
01:29:27,890 --> 01:29:32,960
this latter skill by the way

1438
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:34,730
is incredibly valuable

1439
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:37,780
because you want to do everything from scratch yourself you want to be able to

1440
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:41,650
look at what has been created by somebody else and understand what is inside their

1441
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:44,340
whether it works correctly and how you can build on

1442
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:48,350
this is one of the few places where plagiarism is an OK thing is not

1443
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:50,070
bad to few like learn

1444
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:53,070
from the skills of others in order to create something you want to write a

1445
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,840
come back to plagiarism is about thing later on

1446
01:29:56,450 --> 01:29:59,870
third thing we want you to do is to understand the fundamental

1447
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:02,370
both capabilities and limitations

1448
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,840
and the costs associated with them

1449
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:09,280
in that latter statement sounds funny i don't think of computation having limits but they

1450
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,950
there are some things that cannot be computed we want to understand what those limits

1451
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,850
it's going to be able to understand

1452
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:19,090
abilities and limits

1453
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:28,840
and then finally the last tactical skill that you're going to get out of this

1454
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:32,700
course is you're going to have the ability to map scientific problems

1455
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:35,100
into a computational framework

1456
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:38,080
to be able to take a description of the problem

1457
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:43,720
map into something computational

1458
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:48,870
now if you think about it

1459
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,280
so it sounds like grammar school

1460
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:53,030
the teacher read

1461
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,020
teacher right

1462
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:58,650
the teacher to understand what you can and cannot do

1463
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:02,120
most importantly we want to try and give you the start of and ability to

1464
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:05,450
take a description of the problem from some other domain

1465
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:08,600
figure out how to map it into that domain of computation so you can do

1466
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,870
the reading and writing that you want to do

1467
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,220
OK a few minutes when start talking about what is computation how are we going

1468
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,980
to start building those tools but that's what you should take away that's what you're

1469
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:19,550
going to gain out of this course

1470
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:21,860
by the time you done

1471
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:25,820
now let me take a sidebar for about five minutes to talk about

1472
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:28,790
course administration the ministry of things that we're going to do in the course so

1473
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:31,030
you know what the rules are

1474
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:33,240
right so classes

1475
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:34,740
two hours electroweak

1476
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:37,600
you obviously know where you know when you're here

1477
01:31:37,610 --> 01:31:39,920
two seasons there's a eleven

1478
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:44,220
one hour recitation week on fridays come back in the second home to set up

1479
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:45,040
for that

1480
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:48,460
nine hours a week about side the class work

1481
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:52,470
nine hours are going to be primarily working on problem sets and all the problem

1482
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:55,390
sets are going to involve programming in python

1483
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:57,590
the language is going to be using this term

1484
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:02,910
i think this is the first problem it's pretty easy actually is probably wrong john

1485
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:06,200
they're very easy and we're going to ramp up by the time we get to

1486
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,950
the end of the term is going to be dealing with some fairly complex things

1487
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:11,470
so one of the things are going to see is we're going to make heavy

1488
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:14,450
use of libraries or code written by others

1489
01:32:14,490 --> 01:32:18,360
it will allow you to tackle interesting problems of having to write from scratch but

1490
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,900
it does mean that this

1491
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:24,360
scale here is going to be really valuable you need to be able to read

1492
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:28,220
that code and understand what was right you're wrong

1493
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:30,490
two quizzes

1494
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:31,670
during the term

1495
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:34,850
the dates have already been scheduled john i forgot to look them up i think

1496
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:37,090
it's october second in november

1497
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:39,410
fourth it will be on the course website

1498
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:43,730
my point is go check the course website which by the way is right there

1499
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:47,830
if you have if you know you have a conflict of one of those quizzed

1500
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:50,620
states now please see john right right away

1501
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:53,990
will arrange something ahead of time but if you

1502
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:56,860
reason saying that is you know you know they are getting married that day for

1503
01:32:56,860 --> 01:33:00,740
example we will excuse you from the quiz to get married expected to come right

1504
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:03,610
back to do the quiz by the way but the

1505
01:33:03,630 --> 01:33:07,230
four tough crowd all right

1506
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,480
if you have a conflict please let us know

1507
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:15,060
the second thing is if you have an MIT documented special need for taking quizzes

1508
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:17,430
please see john right well in advance

1509
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,610
these two weeks before the quiz again will arrange for this but you need to

1510
01:33:20,610 --> 01:33:23,980
give us enough warning so that we can deal with that

1511
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:27,070
OK the quizzes are open book

1512
01:33:27,110 --> 01:33:28,020
this course

1513
01:33:28,050 --> 01:33:29,470
it is not a book

1514
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:33,940
how will you can memorize facts in fact i think both john our little sensitive

1515
01:33:33,950 --> 01:33:36,240
to memory test given our a john

1516
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:39,550
this is not about how you memorize things is about how you think so the

1517
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:43,850
open up open book is really going to test your ability to think

1518
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:49,200
grades for the course will be assigned roughly and i use the word roughly because

1519
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,500
we reserve the right to move these numbers around a little bit but basically in

1520
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:56,850
the following percentages fifty five percent of great comes from the problem set

1521
01:33:56,860 --> 01:34:00,980
the forty five come from the quiz shows that two quizzes in the final exam

1522
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:04,090
i forgot the final exam during final periods of the quiz

1523
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:06,520
percentages are ten fifteen and twenty percent

1524
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:09,250
mix of the other forty five

1525
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:12,610
OK other administrative you

1526
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:15,070
just look through my list here

1527
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:19,710
the first problem set concept zero is already been posted this is a really easy

1528
01:34:19,710 --> 01:34:23,340
what we intended to be really easy problems it is basically to get you to

1529
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:26,340
load up i found on your machine to make sure you understand how to interact

1530
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:32,050
the first problems that will be posted shortly it's also pretty boring somewhat like my

1531
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:33,710
lectures but not johns

1532
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:36,440
and that means you know we want to do is to get going on things

1533
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:39,890
don't worry we're going to make them more interesting was to go along nonetheless i

1534
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:43,900
want to stress that none of these problems that are intended to be lethal

1535
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:46,940
we're not using them to we due out we're using them to help you learn

1536
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:51,560
so if you run into problems that just you don't get

1537
01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:53,510
right to seek help

1538
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:55,100
could be psychiatric help

1539
01:34:55,150 --> 01:34:57,970
could be t eight i recommend that you

1540
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:00,700
my point being please come and talk to somebody

1541
01:35:00,730 --> 01:35:04,070
the problems are set up so that if you start down the right path that

1542
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:05,510
should be pretty straightforward

1543
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:06,850
to work it through

1544
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:09,180
if you start down a plausible but

1545
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:12,940
incorrect patterns you can sometimes find yourself stuck in the weeds somewhere

1546
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:15,730
and we want to bring you back in so part of the goal here is

1547
01:35:15,730 --> 01:35:16,980
this should not be

1548
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:21,840
and in ruling exhausting kind of test is really something that should be helping you

1549
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,480
learn the material if you need help as john myself for the is that's what

1550
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:27,720
we're here for

1551
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:31,920
OK we're gonna run primarily a paperless subject

1552
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:34,950
that's why the website is there please check it that's where everything's going to be

1553
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:37,320
posted in terms of things you need to know

1554
01:35:37,350 --> 01:35:41,470
in particular please go to it today you'll find the form there that you need

1555
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:46,060
to fill up to register for or sign up for other recitation

1556
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:50,620
recitations on friday right now we have been scheduled nine ten eleven twelve one and

1557
01:35:51,930 --> 01:35:53,150
we may

1558
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:57,720
drop one of the recitation just depending on course size right so we reserve the

1559
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,080
right unfortunately to have to move your around

1560
01:36:00,090 --> 01:36:03,390
my guess is that nine is not going to be tremendously popular time but maybe

1561
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:04,670
you'll surprise me

1562
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:08,430
nonetheless please go going sign up we will let you sign up for whichever recitation

1563
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:09,890
makes sense for you

1564
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:12,750
g two

1565
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:14,280
of the w

1566
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:21,580
notice this is starting to look a little bit like what we want

1567
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:25,600
because what we want is the sum of the y sequence

1568
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:30,370
the product of exponentials or the exponential

1569
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:32,160
one of the sub

1570
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:36,270
and here i have it's not the sum of the whole y sequence but is

1571
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:37,730
the sum of

1572
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:43,060
to sum over single the

1573
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:47,120
the some of the g values

1574
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:50,160
so i can call this

1575
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:51,480
some of

1576
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:53,730
y one

1577
01:36:57,750 --> 01:37:01,850
so the if i calculate the matrix and one two

1578
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:05,270
and i look at it and to a start w

1579
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,400
that's going to be the sum over all y one

1580
01:37:09,310 --> 01:37:11,360
exponential of g one

1581
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:18,850
star y one class g two of y one w

1582
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:26,110
so i can continue

1583
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,870
one two three

1584
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:37,720
so now multiplying together and one and m two and m three

1585
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:39,540
of money

1586
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:42,910
and i look at the

1587
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:48,840
entry in that

1588
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:52,830
and it's going to be the

1589
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:55,960
some of the y two

1590
01:37:57,810 --> 01:38:01,420
and one two

1591
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,090
y two

1592
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:11,060
and so we

1593
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:19,590
y two w

1594
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:23,860
is the

1595
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:29,740
some of the y two

1596
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:37,110
so now i'm going to plug in here

1597
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:41,470
what i just learned from here

1598
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:49,580
some of the light two

1599
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:50,540
some of the

1600
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:53,750
y one

1601
01:38:55,810 --> 01:38:57,960
exponential of

1602
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,740
start y one

1603
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,860
g two

1604
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,710
y one

1605
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:14,460
y two

1606
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:32,510
then i heard

1607
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:35,830
i have a history of y two w

1608
01:39:35,860 --> 01:39:38,770
so that is the

1609
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:44,830
g so we

1610
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:51,870
y two w

1611
01:39:52,790 --> 01:39:56,110
this is

1612
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:58,030
some of the y one

1613
01:39:58,050 --> 01:39:59,610
and y two

1614
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:08,180
g one start

1615
01:40:08,190 --> 01:40:10,780
why one class

1616
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:13,370
g two

1617
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:15,440
y one y two

1618
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:19,790
g three

1619
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:22,380
able to deal with weird functions two

1620
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:24,190
for weird functions

1621
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:30,170
this this measure the set of values of time in which the function is in

1622
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:35,510
some tiny little slice here the measure that is going to become rather complicated

1623
01:40:35,590 --> 01:40:39,980
and therefore we have to understand how to find the measure of some pretty weird

1624
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,480
the bank went on and said OK

1625
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:48,290
well defined how to find measure things

1626
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:50,650
you know it's all very intuitive

1627
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,780
have any real numbers

1628
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:54,160
a and b

1629
01:40:54,170 --> 01:40:58,270
i two real numbers i might as well say one of them is less than

1630
01:40:58,270 --> 01:41:02,140
or equal to the other one so y is less than or equal to b

1631
01:41:02,150 --> 01:41:07,280
i want to include minus infinity and plus here when we say the set of

1632
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,290
real numbers

1633
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:12,890
we don't include minus infinity and plus infinity

1634
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:18,220
when we talk about the extended set of real numbers we do include include minus

1635
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:23,720
infinity plus here for the most part when we're dealing with measure theory we really

1636
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:29,430
want to include minus infinity and plus than the also because because they make things

1637
01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:31,110
easier to talk about

1638
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:35,470
so what makes said is for any interval

1639
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:39,570
the set of points which lie between a and b

1640
01:41:39,610 --> 01:41:44,690
he started out with the open interval namely the set of points not including a

1641
01:41:44,690 --> 01:41:48,860
and not including b but including all the real numbers in between

1642
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:53,880
the measure is that is what we said before and none of you objected to

1643
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,300
the measure of an interval

1644
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:58,990
what to be the size of the interval because

1645
01:41:59,370 --> 01:42:04,600
after all the big was doing was taking size and putting another name one

1646
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:05,820
because we all

1647
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:10,880
because we all thought of as being size so the measure the interval a b

1648
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:13,430
is b-minus

1649
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:18,030
analysis engineers we all know that doesn't really make any difference whether you include your

1650
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:22,610
don't include a and we're trying to find the size of the inevitable so he

1651
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:27,430
said OK it's it's the size of that intervals b-minus a

1652
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:31,630
whether or not you include either the endpoints

1653
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:36,940
then he went on to say something else the measure of a countable union of

1654
01:42:36,940 --> 01:42:38,540
disjoint intervals

1655
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:41,710
is the sum of the measure of each interval

1656
01:42:42,850 --> 01:42:44,400
the sum

1657
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:47,190
and we already

1658
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:51,400
i said when we are trying to figure out what to the beginning rule was

1659
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:53,640
but if you had several

1660
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:55,620
intervals the measure

1661
01:42:56,490 --> 01:43:01,550
of the entire interval namely the measure the union of the centre of intervals ought

1662
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:03,090
to be the sum

1663
01:43:03,630 --> 01:43:05,610
the measure of each interval

1664
01:43:05,630 --> 01:43:07,580
so all these adding here

1665
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:11,360
is let's go on and go to the limit and talk about

1666
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:15,970
and talk about a countably infinite number of intervals

1667
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:18,800
and use the same definition

1668
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:20,920
now there's one nice thing about that

1669
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:22,530
what is it

1670
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:23,840
if we take

1671
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:26,640
and so on

1672
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,920
they are the countable set of things

1673
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:32,790
each of those things is nonnegative

1674
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:35,830
so what happens when we take the sum

1675
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:42,850
of a bunch of nonnegative numbers

1676
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:45,910
there are only two possibilities when you take the sum

1677
01:43:46,050 --> 01:43:50,140
even a countable set of nonnegative numbers

1678
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:54,070
and what are they

1679
01:43:54,070 --> 01:43:59,420
because it goes to limit or goes to infinity yes

1680
01:43:59,430 --> 01:44:02,890
and the base said well let's say it if it goes to infinity that's the

1681
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:04,450
limit offset

1682
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:09,150
so in other words are only two possibilities the sum is finite if you can

1683
01:44:09,150 --> 01:44:13,630
find this out in the sum is infinite nothing else can happen

1684
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:16,330
so that's nice

1685
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:21,120
and then look back said one other thing about the mathematicians trying to deal with

1686
01:44:21,970 --> 01:44:24,290
did different things

1687
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:28,440
when they were trying to deal with very small sets

1688
01:44:28,810 --> 01:44:33,040
and some of them said well these very small sets are measurable

1689
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:38,280
others and part of the bags genius was it is said if you can take

1690
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:40,140
a set of points

1691
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:43,380
and you can put them inside another set of points

1692
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:45,930
which doesn't amount to anything

1693
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:50,750
then this is smaller set of points to have a measure which is less than

1694
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:53,320
or equal to the bigger set of points

1695
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:54,630
so we went on

1696
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:59,040
so so that that says that any subset

1697
01:44:59,050 --> 01:45:00,630
of something that doesn't

1698
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:02,300
it has zero measure

1699
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:06,660
what also have zero mean and we look at some examples you'll see that that's

1700
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:07,730
not quite as

1701
01:45:07,830 --> 01:45:11,430
as obvious as it seems but anyway he said that

1702
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:14,150
and even nicer way to put that

1703
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:17,730
is when you're talking about weird intervals

1704
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:22,690
try to cover that come try to cover that we're set

1705
01:45:22,710 --> 01:45:26,720
with a bunch of intervals

1706
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:29,700
and if you can cover with a bunch of intervals

1707
01:45:29,710 --> 01:45:34,360
in different ways and the measure of the bunch of intervals the countable set of

1708
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:38,360
yes you can make it arbitrarily small

1709
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:41,770
then we also say that the set has measure zero

1710
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:45,380
so any time you have a set s

1711
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:46,980
and you can cover it

1712
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,580
with intervals

1713
01:45:48,580 --> 01:45:51,490
which have arbitrarily small measure

1714
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:55,270
namely we make the measure the intervals the small you want to make that we

1715
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:56,360
say bingo

1716
01:45:56,370 --> 01:45:58,590
as has zero measure

1717
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:02,590
now that's going to be very nice because it let's get rid of an awful

1718
01:46:02,590 --> 01:46:04,080
lot of things

1719
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:07,840
because any time we have some set

1720
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:12,020
which has zero measure in this sense when we look back to what we did

1721
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:13,810
with all the beginning

1722
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:14,970
it says

1723
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,880
good forget about

1724
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:22,200
it has zero measure it doesn't come into the n at all

1725
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:25,210
and that's exactly the thing we what we'd like to get rid of all that

1726
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,840
number one to get rid of it we have these

1727
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:34,640
sets which have made zero they don't amount to anything

1728
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:38,440
and we're not going to worry about them

1729
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:40,430
OK let's

1730
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,660
let's do an example

1731
01:46:42,670 --> 01:46:44,790
a famous example

1732
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,360
what about the set of rationals

1733
01:46:48,410 --> 01:46:51,450
which lie between zero and one

1734
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:54,640
OK well what were rational numbers are numbers

1735
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:56,370
within the perceptron algorithm um

1736
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:59,820
you do end up with a reasonable solution if you if you there's a learning

1737
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:01,700
rate and if you reduce the learning rates

1738
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:06,780
in a slow enough where you will actually find the optimal

1739
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:10,090
hyperplane this is the thing that was known in nineteen

1740
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:14,030
well it was known easily by the nineteen nineties when i came in the field

1741
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:16,490
the algorithm is basically

1742
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:19,820
the weights

1743
01:47:20,370 --> 01:47:24,530
and new ads the weight some learning rate times the label value times the data

1744
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:28,410
point very what that's it so if the so u iterate u

1745
01:47:29,590 --> 01:47:31,320
make not increment kay increment

1746
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,550
and you select a misclassified point you ignore

1747
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:39,550
there any points correctly classified so for example

1748
01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:41,990
if you'll hear if you

1749
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:43,340
wait solution is there

1750
01:47:44,110 --> 01:47:49,010
in all these solutions are fine it's only this one they are infringing seems like this guy

1751
01:47:49,390 --> 01:47:51,200
and you update in that direction

1752
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:56,510
so many of you may actually go beyond you don't do anything intelligent

1753
01:47:58,010 --> 01:48:00,590
you just take a learning rate i guess in e

1754
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:05,140
i don't really understand of in the simplex method to understand the

1755
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:07,720
you could it perhaps the case that

1756
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:13,320
you're doing something definitely more intelligent simplex method you want overshoot i'm hey you could

1757
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:16,370
potentially overshoot but then you look at this one and you go back again

1758
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:19,530
i've got a little older

1759
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:22,910
visualization about this is all historic stuff

1760
01:48:23,450 --> 01:48:27,840
so here's is a simple dataset and what we do is on we select initially

1761
01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:32,140
some data point and we build these initial decision boundary based on the data point

1762
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:32,660
only so

1763
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:37,470
we start with the weights being zero

1764
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:43,220
and for the first iteration we set the weight vector to one the data point values which in this case

1765
01:48:44,590 --> 01:48:46,240
selected data point i circled

1766
01:48:46,970 --> 01:48:47,890
and that's the result

1767
01:48:49,490 --> 01:48:51,220
so we don't multiply being observed

1768
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:52,930
the value of the data points

1769
01:48:53,390 --> 01:48:54,200
m times it's

1770
01:48:56,530 --> 01:49:00,660
then we go through selecting incorrectly classified data points are circled one there

1771
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:08,030
which is incorrectly classified and we do this all day we multiply the incorrectly classified data point by its label

1772
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:12,950
adjust the weight vector

1773
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:16,490
now very often

1774
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:18,470
this converges very quickly

1775
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:22,090
so this at one green point there

1776
01:49:23,450 --> 01:49:25,070
there is no incorrectly classified yeah

1777
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:27,930
and then

1778
01:49:28,870 --> 01:49:33,260
all data now correctly classified now that's just an example i set that is separable

1779
01:49:33,450 --> 01:49:35,950
has to count in the galapagos in distributions

1780
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:38,300
the feasible region would be

1781
01:49:39,550 --> 01:49:42,340
any region in hand we can bend at

1782
01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:51,200
o point and not without misclassifying that's all misclassifying that's so there's a small feasible region that we could find

1783
01:49:51,950 --> 01:49:54,070
the support vector machine work is about

1784
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:56,070
making that's solution unique

1785
01:49:56,590 --> 01:50:01,030
by adding a quadratic term so that you get a quadratic programming programme with linear

1786
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:04,430
constraints and you look for the maximum margin of separation

1787
01:50:04,910 --> 01:50:08,120
now the funny thing about rosenblatt when he specifies this learning rule

1788
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:09,870
is i don't think he's

1789
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:14,550
well i have read the original paper but i think it's just an intuitive learning

1790
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:18,530
rule that you know the usual if you've got something wrong you should look at

1791
01:50:18,530 --> 01:50:22,720
the thing you've got wrong and you should add it into your r weight vector

1792
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:25,870
but it still works at least things like hebbian learning

1793
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:30,680
which people use for hopfield networks but they were and hebbian learning is something that

1794
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:34,620
i believe there is some evidence for existing between neurons in the brain so

1795
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:36,390
there's a nice connection there

1796
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,160
so regression examples

1797
01:50:38,970 --> 01:50:40,410
predict why given x

1798
01:50:41,780 --> 01:50:45,280
in the why given x we define an error function now which is

1799
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:46,970
so we have some

1800
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:50,740
in the linear case we say that we've got some function of x which is

1801
01:50:51,340 --> 01:50:52,740
gradient plus an offset

1802
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:58,640
and then we might define an error function in a case which is the distance between theorem

1803
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:01,110
data an hour target function

1804
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:06,890
we can add a portion of the air to the bias and what we there also trying to

1805
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:08,430
is adam

1806
01:51:09,390 --> 01:51:14,850
uh somebody area to these gradient now this we can do iterative learning these things

1807
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:18,700
by updating the bias and set a very similar way to the perceptron

1808
01:51:23,530 --> 01:51:28,160
you get the same so the fact is we select every data point in time we can actually update

1809
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:35,300
a linear regression now you all know that this is the standard way of doing

1810
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:37,090
linear regression but this is a solution

1811
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:44,570
gradient descent version of linear regression so we're updating and actually an underlying error function

1812
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:47,820
now but i think people didn't think about that's so much in the early days

1813
01:51:47,870 --> 01:51:49,050
machine learning so

1814
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:50,700
you do it until

1815
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:55,410
you have a solution that fits now of course that's solvable

1816
01:51:55,850 --> 01:51:59,760
with a little bit of linear algebra and that's how we'll do it today

1817
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:02,200
but i think in many machine learning those people

1818
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:04,550
we are interested in learning rules

1819
01:52:05,590 --> 01:52:07,740
more than they were interested in the objective function

1820
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:10,030
because they want to know how neurons

1821
01:52:10,470 --> 01:52:11,780
more updating their own ways

1822
01:52:12,410 --> 01:52:14,490
and the course we can go to nonlinear cases

1823
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:20,370
so if the x is not linearly related to why don't we create a feature

1824
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:23,140
space and you've already seen me do this before so hear

1825
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:25,340
we've got a function

1826
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:30,510
x which is equal to the sum in a product between the basis functions and the

1827
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:34,350
i weights and if we apply the same the rules to those weights

1828
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:37,550
we can also do the perceptron so here's a basis

1829
01:52:38,070 --> 01:52:39,370
this is a quadratic basis

1830
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:41,910
so it's got three different parts

1831
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:45,590
um and we can sample

1832
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,720
from the quadratic basis by

1833
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:49,260
so we can look at

1834
01:52:49,950 --> 01:52:55,140
as i was doing in the canopy shimei lecture we can say world for some random values that w

1835
01:52:55,550 --> 01:52:59,470
what's the functions can this produced and there are obviously all quadratics

1836
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:03,910
so we sample three random values and w here with sampling

1837
01:53:04,590 --> 01:53:07,070
w one which is the offset is point eight seven

1838
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:13,620
w two is minus one point three eight three five and w three is minus two

1839
01:53:14,140 --> 01:53:15,070
o point five eight and

1840
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:16,530
these are the basis

1841
01:53:18,780 --> 01:53:22,090
and this is the weighted sum of the bases so we've got a

1842
01:53:22,370 --> 01:53:23,260
some positive

1843
01:53:23,930 --> 01:53:26,740
weight on w one s o point eight seven so

1844
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:28,140
around there

1845
01:53:29,490 --> 01:53:31,570
so that's value should be point seven

1846
01:53:33,570 --> 01:53:34,090
zero there

1847
01:53:35,410 --> 01:53:37,030
we've got a very negative way

1848
01:53:38,570 --> 01:53:41,970
linear function so it's slightly negative going down in this way

1849
01:53:42,370 --> 01:53:46,180
so you can see that this side of the quadratic is actually lower than this site even though

1850
01:53:47,050 --> 01:53:48,510
the axisymmetric

1851
01:53:49,470 --> 01:53:51,490
and then we got a negative weight minus two

1852
01:53:51,970 --> 01:53:53,590
on the quadratic term so there

1853
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:55,740
quadratic form is showing quite strongly

1854
01:53:56,550 --> 01:54:00,120
double what it was in the first one was should be could report something so

1855
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:02,550
that's about point seven or something

1856
01:54:02,970 --> 01:54:05,870
so it's been and then it's gone in termite to be lower still

1857
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:09,820
and we can some those three things together we get a function that is non linear

1858
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:12,640
and that's what we think of as the feature space

1859
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:14,610
and not talked about that's

1860
01:54:14,610 --> 01:54:17,060
and that's what did so here actually

1861
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:21,050
so in this

1862
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:27,700
you don't

1863
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:31,190
this is an example of this sort of

1864
01:54:31,210 --> 01:54:37,790
demonstrate the principle behind if you actually read the XSLT script to automatically convert policy

1865
01:54:37,830 --> 01:54:41,230
this policy documents into our hearts to reason over there

1866
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:46,040
so here we have two different kinds of despair sort of search so we have

1867
01:54:46,290 --> 01:54:53,880
that led to another trying to succeed

1868
01:54:54,030 --> 01:54:57,550
we also have the cost security these are two separate domains that you might want

1869
01:54:57,550 --> 01:54:58,940
to model

1870
01:54:58,950 --> 01:55:04,340
time for i two

1871
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:05,530
this is a

1872
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:07,110
one question for you

1873
01:55:07,130 --> 01:55:10,910
it seems reasonable policy constrict things

1874
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:15,900
so now we try to combine them together

1875
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:19,310
here this is all

1876
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:21,170
this is

1877
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,680
i see

1878
01:55:23,690 --> 01:55:28,750
with the underlying message the the mapping that we bring over and

1879
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:33,500
so what is this good right this is only a little later in some sense

1880
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,590
it's a little data

1881
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:36,740
if we look here

1882
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:42,670
you know the policy you will have to for for the operators anymore so we're

1883
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:47,710
losing it's like you know we're you're looking at here is

1884
01:55:50,770 --> 01:55:52,210
this was the

1885
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:54,440
course you find

1886
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:56,590
so these

1887
01:55:56,600 --> 01:56:03,050
reading the origin can see all all the good news

1888
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:09,610
but not always completely unconstrained here the all disappears

1889
01:56:09,620 --> 01:56:11,980
in two

1890
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,300
the intersection of

1891
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:21,040
what's happening because it disappears into the intersection of we can actually do something useful

1892
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:24,980
so for example when i turn on the reason

1893
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:27,740
when learning new things about this

1894
01:56:27,790 --> 01:56:30,960
so what i learning

1895
01:56:30,980 --> 01:56:37,930
so again because

1896
01:56:41,270 --> 01:56:43,730
o five hundred the one

1897
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:47,600
so how right now some fifteen

1898
01:56:48,910 --> 01:56:50,430
what is the subject of

1899
01:56:50,450 --> 01:56:52,040
some of all

1900
01:56:52,050 --> 01:56:55,490
all of the

1901
01:56:56,130 --> 01:56:57,670
one of them

1902
01:56:57,850 --> 01:56:59,210
all three

1903
01:56:59,230 --> 01:57:05,960
he and he said of

1904
01:57:05,980 --> 01:57:10,470
so now you simply multiply also inspired by

1905
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:19,290
one more restrictions but still maintaining one of

1906
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:27,580
more specific more interestingly maybe it's getting because we have incoherent policy

1907
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:29,820
so here are defined policy

1908
01:57:29,830 --> 01:57:32,160
that is unsatisfiable

1909
01:57:32,210 --> 01:57:33,500
which you can do

1910
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:36,400
they played

1911
01:57:36,410 --> 01:57:47,490
and all this one one five o sixty four million so nobody needs this also

1912
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:50,930
to test this to find i can do it strictly by

1913
01:57:53,110 --> 01:57:56,160
so we get all we know what to buy

1914
01:57:59,890 --> 01:58:05,690
but of course processes we can apply different services we have to define policy knowledge

1915
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:09,300
so all forms of all

1916
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:13,370
high pressure was of interest for instance of the class

1917
01:58:13,390 --> 01:58:15,170
o can tell us that

1918
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:21,640
one of the whole thing looks

1919
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:23,320
during the disjoint

1920
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:24,370
which we can do

1921
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:26,300
i'm posting here

1922
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:29,780
the problem of these concepts

1923
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:34,550
now all are of

1924
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:39,530
it's actually pretty big deal and the encourages you so one of the things that

1925
01:58:39,530 --> 01:58:43,640
you don't have the holes w possible trying to get

1926
01:58:43,730 --> 01:58:45,590
the story

1927
01:58:48,090 --> 01:58:51,990
is this notion of having more or less general

1928
01:59:04,110 --> 01:59:08,360
we're looking at for the

1929
01:59:08,370 --> 01:59:12,280
so what

1930
01:59:12,290 --> 01:59:14,800
are more like

1931
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:19,990
the war

1932
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:22,690
o four

1933
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:25,580
policy so i can start adding multiple hierarchies

1934
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:26,710
post that

1935
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:27,350
post post

1936
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:35,260
very often described in general terms

1937
01:59:35,270 --> 01:59:37,180
so looking at the average

1938
01:59:37,190 --> 01:59:40,650
people based on what people see what also or

1939
01:59:40,690 --> 01:59:44,510
one of the things i mean this

1940
01:59:45,890 --> 01:59:47,180
these two

1941
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:52,760
one of them tries to make our work as if it were xmlschema

1942
01:59:52,770 --> 01:59:56,060
right we have a lot more

1943
01:59:59,530 --> 02:00:03,540
so the small scheme but i do

1944
02:00:04,290 --> 02:00:08,830
in this particular example we are extremely fortunate that there was pretty exact mapping between

1945
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:15,250
the languages for the contract of one very onto the contracts and they were able

1946
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,510
to discover

1947
02:00:16,590 --> 02:00:18,660
that was

1948
02:00:18,710 --> 02:00:23,030
this surface the of

1949
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:25,620
in the policy there's no

1950
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:29,710
there's no sign of the idea that we have made

1951
02:00:31,780 --> 02:00:33,540
or five

1952
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:35,090
but generally

1953
02:00:35,110 --> 02:00:39,050
one of the more general

1954
02:00:39,090 --> 02:00:42,500
there's nothing like that in

1955
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:47,130
we also he's going on to do this work for example to a role

1956
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:48,720
access control

1957
02:00:48,730 --> 02:00:50,880
also just

1958
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:55,560
the figuring out what's going on

1959
02:00:55,950 --> 02:00:58,080
you a COI

1960
02:00:58,130 --> 02:01:01,900
of access control or or four WS policy

1961
02:01:03,470 --> 02:01:06,930
we get all the services we offer

1962
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:10,280
all of the data

1963
02:01:10,310 --> 02:01:12,410
class iteratively

1964
02:01:12,430 --> 02:01:14,760
by the or

1965
02:01:14,830 --> 02:01:15,780
two weeks

1966
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:21,710
tom also starred in general all CI phi phi phi on the side of the

1967
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:27,480
more than one of her cigars and these

1968
02:01:27,490 --> 02:01:29,170
techniques are our

1969
02:01:29,210 --> 02:01:35,280
