1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,170
coming here

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,570
and we can commend the telescope from here we can orient the telescope we can

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,660
drop ballast

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,250
very important we can terminate the flight

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,460
so we read that save the telescope and it starts drifting out over the ocean

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,920
because the balloon start

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,820
going with the winds at the altitude of hundred fifty

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,040
thousand feet

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,370
and those winds can vary anywhere from twenty thirty

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,220
miles per hour two up two

11
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,380
a hundred miles before we we try to fly only during the

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,000
they that the

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,880
when is low and that's the case in the spring

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,480
and in the fall we call that the turnaround

15
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,610
winds at these altitudes

16
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,840
twice per year

17
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,570
the change from about one hundred miles per hour to the west two hundred miles

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,640
was to the east happens in the spring and fall

19
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,780
and that's when we try to fly

20
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,780
when the winds are very low when they are in the process of turning around

21
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,270
we follow the balloon at low altitude five six thousand feet

22
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,190
a small airplane

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,020
i'm sitting here on the airplane

24
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,260
this is the typical airplane that we used to

25
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,740
hope from airport to airport

26
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,510
and stay as close to the balloon as we can

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,070
so that we can give terminate command and later

28
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,210
we can

29
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,550
recover the payload

30
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,720
which is an eventual by itself

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,020
in australia it is much harder than in the united states this was pass

32
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,020
but in australia there are no

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,200
airports in the desert and sort it is way harder to help

34
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,650
from place to place

35
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,320
i'm taking into australia now he's alice springs

36
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,240
when we launched this flight

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,710
in the days before we

38
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,600
had balloons

39
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,940
weather balloons test balloons which we drove up two hundred forty to fifty thousand feet

40
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,720
and then we probe the wins at that altitude

41
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,730
and the

42
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,850
people who did that

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,130
good reasons to believe that the balloon would you go sort of in this direction

44
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,560
well maybe here but in any case it would go north north-northwest

45
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,060
and so we look all these radio stations in australia

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,110
to look out for the balloon wave radar reflectors so they could give us an

47
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,410
early warning

48
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,070
because between here and here there are really no air

49
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,010
o ports

50
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,500
so if we follow this by airplane

51
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,590
you can land during the day at some

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,540
but really there are really no

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,740
no runways so that's pretty dangerous at night you could land here

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,960
so we were hoping that these radio stations would give us an early alert to

55
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,500
tell us where the balloon is

56
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,780
what happened however the balloon went straight down

57
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,670
and then was sunset so we don't know exactly where the balloon is at sunset

58
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,730
we can see that we

59
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,830
of radio contact was it

60
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,100
so we were flying close to it

61
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,910
and then at sunrise we picked it up we could see it

62
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,420
and then here when it was getting close to forbidden zone because there's

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,200
commercial flights here

64
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,160
we cut it down so we gave the air the radio command which separates the

65
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,800
from the balloon the balloon is very brittle it's very cold there

66
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,440
the balloon shatters

67
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,470
breaks in pieces comes down

68
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,190
and if everything goes well then parachute

69
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,390
brings the telescope safely

70
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,820
back to earth

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,110
this is the person that we contacted during the flight

72
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,370
try to

73
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,560
draw the attention of local people

74
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,240
you do that by flying which you airplane low over the house this person live

75
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,270
in the desert and its nearest neighbour was some seventy miles away from the

76
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,500
he was crazy

77
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,030
he was always drunk

78
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,130
he was shooting kangaroos in the desert

79
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,190
there's no windshield here

80
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,420
you will drive sixty miles an hour

81
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,290
and then he would change his kangaroos and shoot him

82
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,860
any other crazy games

83
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,910
which i didn't like at all he would put the dog on the roof

84
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,390
he gave me a demonstration once i was with him in this track

85
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,110
and he would drive sixty miles per hour which slammed the brakes in the dogwood

86
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,810
chemical through the air

87
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:02,340
and then he would say you can teach an old dog any new tricks

88
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,090
we encountered

89
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,820
wonderful animals during recovery

90
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,000
koala bear

91
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,910
quiet peaceful

92
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,610
very lazy online

93
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,690
most into one students

94
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,990
and then we got close to the payload

95
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,600
OK so they're gonna hafta

96
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,270
to get to the payload

97
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,040
there was this nasty glamour

98
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,810
he was about six feet long

99
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,640
let me tell you i was really scared it scared the hell out of me

100
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,970
but of course i didn't want to show that so i said to my graduate

101
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:39,260
student there's no problem these animals are harmless you go first

102
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,460
and he did

103
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,360
and it turns out they are harmless

104
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,350
and during the entire four hours it took us to recover the payload get on

105
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,390
jack's truck

106
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,650
this animal was just sitting still didn't move at all that is his way of

107
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,780
thinking that

108
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,080
and we don't

109
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,990
see him them

110
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,440
beautiful animals these quantities

111
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,660
aborigines eat them it's very precious full by away

112
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,920
so here you see don brooks who was an american who came with me was

113
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,840
an electronic experts and this is alice which was the wife of

114
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,160
you see the payload here

115
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,290
from all over

116
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,060
but it's in good condition

117
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,560
the crash pad

118
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,550
is there are purposely to protect against impact

119
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,790
get lower decelerations and of course it's OK to

120
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,350
crashed bad

121
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,090
destroyed that's the whole idea

122
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,670
and and then when you come back a few days later analysis brings it's there's

123
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,220
nothing happens every analysis brings

124
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,780
nearly all in the ground

125
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,950
so it is front page news perfect balloon launch

126
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,050
and thousand what's the start of the space probe they call it the space probe

127
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,580
i had a long interview with this

128
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,290
with this news reporter

129
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,410
and i told him that the reason why we have to go high is because

130
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,510
of the absorption of x-rays into the atmosphere

131
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,630
but the article didn't get that across

132
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,690
they said they fly balloons because then the closer to the stars well

133
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,800
i suppose it is close enough but it's really miss the issue

134
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,080
of the absorption of the x-rays

135
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,190
which of course

136
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,850
that's the reason why we have to go up not

137
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,850
because we want to get closer to the stars

138
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,240
so now

139
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,310
go back to the blackboards

140
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:38,980
if i can find my way

141
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,310
so between

142
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,580
nineteen sixty six and roughly

143
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,410
late seventies

144
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,010
i had about twenty successful flights

145
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,770
from the united states

146
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,030
from canada

147
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,390
and many from

148
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,890
australia now we also had some problems we had some bad luck

149
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,350
twice during my flights the balloons spot seventy thousand feet that's the trouble cause

150
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,780
very cold minus seventy degrees

151
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,190
there jet wins

152
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,720
and a bit on the balloon

153
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,200
and then the balloon burst them when that happens

154
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,300
we don't have enough time to terminate the flight we can separate the parachute from

155
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,390
the balloon it happens all of a sudden

156
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,870
and then in general

157
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,760
the parish gets entangled

158
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,260
and then you get a free fall solely payload is entirely destroyed in that happened

159
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,310
we were lucky enough that several occasions we made some

160
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,940
well quite

161
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
here's the gentemplate four

162
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,750
the predicate extent cardinality which i probably should have given you more information about so

163
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,730
let's see if we can

164
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,940
no matter how long can i

165
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,770
OK so extend cardinality

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,460
predicate relates

167
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,290
a set or collection

168
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,830
two an integer so

169
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,000
it tells you how many elements are in the set

170
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,540
if you have an assertion

171
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,630
of the form extent cardinality

172
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,420
a b

173
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,770
you want to

174
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,040
i realize that in english as

175
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,480
its cardinality is b

176
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,350
eighty has be elements

177
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,710
with this one

178
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,710
are one

179
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,630
are two

180
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,770
no no

181
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,940
and it is all this

182
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,730
all these

183
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,460
functions that described

184
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,330
phrases fun

185
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,980
an arbitrary number of arguments

186
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,210
results in the concatenation of all

187
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,920
the term paraphrase find

188
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,420
just just paraphrase

189
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:36,170
it's argument are in the best possible to paraphrase on and he

190
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,330
paraphrase this as a noun phrase

191
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,250
so this means

192
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,940
i realize there are one thousand nounphrase

193
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,960
like its

194
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,920
turned into certain constraints

195
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,960
under the third

196
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,900
and have the word

197
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,690
it has to be the subject and you

198
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,810
i want to have the word to agree with

199
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,860
this initial

200
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,380
this is singular then you want a singular form of having world and you want

201
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,560
this indicated that the initial subject

202
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,860
this is very

203
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,730
specialized knowledge that i don't

204
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,650
i encourage you to acquire must

205
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:26,770
you're really serious about writing ten gentemplate but just to give you a sense of

206
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,190
how this template represent

207
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,980
so that's what that's like

208
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,310
in the sentence with the

209
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,020
the transition from one

210
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,560
the second element is

211
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,960
former the that agrees with

212
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,380
they are

213
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,090
now free to translations

214
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,650
there are two like

215
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,980
this is the

216
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,860
the string known by form of the word member

217
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,880
as one known number

218
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,150
then the number that would be singular has two

219
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,960
numbers that

220
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,310
four lot of this work will be

221
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,290
so you

222
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,860
generally these gentemplate assertions are handwritten but in principle they could be derived

223
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,770
there are some rules that generate

224
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,710
the template solutions

225
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,150
i want to go on

226
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,690
because through this in detail but it's just it just shows that you can derive

227
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,130
these two templates by

228
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,880
kinds of semantic predicates i also wanted to talk about

229
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,850
so remember

230
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:10,500
picture which is one of the detail two groups from strings to concepts

231
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,130
there are two

232
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,880
kinds of morphology

233
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,750
the plural as that goes on

234
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:27,330
dog to form the plural of dog dogs that's inflectional morphology

235
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,900
the string down and this training dogs are both forms

236
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,060
of the same word

237
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,170
with derivational morphology

238
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,880
you take a word and then you have add suffix

239
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,330
four prefixed to it and then you get a whole new word

240
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,350
which has its own set of forms

241
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,630
two strings are inflectional variants

242
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,650
the word dog

243
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,310
i wonder and wonderful

244
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,790
are two separate words that are related

245
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,060
by derivational morphology

246
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,330
inflectional morphology generally

247
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,400
has to do with ten

248
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:22,310
person number and gender

249
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,110
inside there

250
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:35,690
there inflectional suffixes don't correspond to reified individuals whereas you have like meant the suffix

251
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,650
you know you have no reified suffixes inflectional suffixes can and there

252
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,480
content is indicated with regular assertions which also

253
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,440
and then you have rules that attached the

254
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,810
the suffix two

255
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,060
the base

256
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,900
you know that the infinitive form

257
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,270
some more

258
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,080
some string

259
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,520
the five

260
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,170
you get past tense forms

261
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,540
of the same word

262
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,210
that's how inflectional morphology was uses

263
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,880
english the fixation from

264
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,330
and evaluate

265
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,610
the EP on in a smart way

266
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,080
it's not just that

267
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,210
he only played

268
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:36,090
the game you don't get eighteen you get it

269
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,330
so it so it's not just truck at each some

270
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,310
fulfilling do with you

271
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,090
same as well as

272
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,130
yes place

273
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,710
place to place

274
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,860
but as class

275
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,670
classes but apparently not as we just learned

276
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,110
those don't contain the suffix

277
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,310
so the search

278
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,690
the you have to assert those forms directly

279
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:21,630
so we have these are

280
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,980
this is the inflectional suffixes and how they represent represented

281
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,210
with derivational morphology

282
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,130
you have a suffix and it changes the part of speech to words taken barriers

283
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,440
that verb and meant and that makes it now

284
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:45,060
fascination one teacher both

285
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,580
the verbal noun from taken over many now

286
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,490
so basically what is also found is a lot of

287
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,070
constructed thing so basically we started from

288
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,620
seeing how traditional what conditional independencies

289
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:05,290
then we suffer very simple example with only three miles that well conditional independence will

290
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,080
generate a small factorizations

291
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,790
then what we need is that well we just constructed a set of conditional independence

292
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:19,760
that will generate the value of use general factorisation for the joint prob

293
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:24,240
right in particular was so that we have a name for the class of models

294
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,630
they are called bayesian networks OK

295
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,770
of which particular cases

296
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,180
markov random fields and

297
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,990
those are not michael hughes

298
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,380
hidden markov models and

299
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,530
filters and

300
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,710
all this

301
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:49,500
states simple state space models and factor hidden markov models in order

302
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,670
so now we will start to

303
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,520
look at the more and the theory OK

304
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,240
in order to scrutinize and try to understand exactly how

305
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,630
his universe of conditional independence statements

306
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,440
relates to the universe of the representation the factorizations

307
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,080
the joint approach

308
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,910
so basically

309
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,780
what i'm calling it is

310
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,990
conditional independence they well

311
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,920
that's what mentioned previously when you for some given set of conditional independence statements

312
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,670
it does not mean that the conditional independence statements

313
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,470
of the resulting factorizations

314
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,860
we only do all the time

315
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,860
and pulls in order to obtain that for position

316
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,350
they are sufficient to obtain the factorisation but

317
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,280
the just not

318
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,100
the punishment

319
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,190
particular we introduce the what

320
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,610
i just called here a convenient set of conditional independence

321
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,730
each way

322
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,020
according to size the way that

323
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,360
the expression for the joint probability distribution just arise naturally

324
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,460
the question is how we do so

325
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,550
conditions and yes

326
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,830
we happen

327
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,110
what will actually and then you may as well

328
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,010
if i am

329
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:25,920
design i want to design the given graph model for represent of factory works so

330
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,620
gonna make sure

331
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,110
but i know

332
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,430
all the conditional independence statements that they assume

333
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,730
because maybe

334
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,870
i will

335
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:42,870
i assume a set of conditional independence statements

336
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,230
two in by another set of conditional independence statements

337
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,390
no working with

338
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,360
joint distribution that arises from that set

339
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,370
but when i'm working with the try

340
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,450
i'm also working with the model

341
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,170
that respects

342
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,580
another set of conditional independence statements that i haven't

343
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,430
written down in the first place

344
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,490
OK so i need to be aware of

345
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,090
all the

346
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,860
consequences of my initial assumption

347
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,300
so let's

348
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,990
try to look into this

349
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,140
how we characterize its

350
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:31,540
what's the smallest size of vision that that's an interesting well

351
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,990
three node

352
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,790
because if you have three and all you can

353
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,710
you can study conditional independence right

354
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,650
because for conditional independence you need

355
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,300
three five

356
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,120
so let's

357
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,730
try to do an exhaustive study

358
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,420
green old

359
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,770
vision that would be a

360
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:02,080
which sense let's study the conditional independencies in this business

361
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,380
the second let's study this factorisation in is

362
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:11,810
because we always talking about these twins of expectation we have here the set of

363
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,040
conditional independence statements have here

364
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,210
the fac torisation arise from this condition

365
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,380
we start with a very basic types of vision

366
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,290
you only have three no

367
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:33,160
and if we give the precise characterization of these equivalent if there is any

368
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,240
only appears in my objective function in the form of an inner product or scalar

369
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,600
so indeed this brings me to the elaboration of my support vector machine

370
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,680
namely what i can do

371
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,940
if i have a dataset which is highly diminished not separable

372
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,700
that can make my data into a high dimensional space

373
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,520
by replacement okay

374
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,270
by mapping function

375
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,200
if i man data from low dimension to high dimensional

376
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,530
the other thing i always if i go high enough i'll be able to separate

377
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,980
the data OK

378
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,990
so just to illustrate the point

379
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,610
if i just in two dimensions OK and hand

380
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:22,730
plus minus minus plus in two dimensions i can't find hyperplane which separates two types

381
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,040
of data but if it is in three dimensions OK and these are sort of

382
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,540
in the board

383
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,910
and these are sort of like a minus here

384
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,560
currently doing it but then circular OK so have pluses here

385
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,960
and the two months here

386
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,280
like an easy but some hyperplane that separates the two to two dimensions i can't

387
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,070
find hyperplane separates in a three-dimensional world these minuses outside the board i can easily

388
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,760
find hyperplane will do indeed have

389
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,440
formatting to high dimensional space

390
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,650
then i will be able to separate my data

391
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,870
and i we have a problem OK

392
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,810
i will do that for

393
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,940
my data is in the form of the dot product the product and this is

394
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,510
must have a mapping function

395
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:11,850
the maps made from my input space into the high dimensional space which i call

396
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,540
feature space

397
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,090
this is a mapping function

398
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:23,950
and i quantify likely high dimensional space mapped to a feature space

399
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,120
and one thing which must be true

400
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,160
about the space map into

401
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,730
isn't there must be a hilbert space ten textbooks cycle here it can be pre

402
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,340
hilbert space in the product space k

403
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,940
but what i was down to

404
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,450
is of course mapping in the party of so the space map into

405
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,100
and in the product must be defined so must be an inner product space so

406
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,470
he pre hilbert space

407
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:55,350
the one thing that may be bothering one thing is important courses

408
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,500
if i'm gonna mapping the high dimensional space and must have some mapping function

409
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,970
one of in very simple cases polynomial kernels i could actually figure out what the

410
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,230
mapping function is

411
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,050
but one of the curious thing about the kernel methods is i can

412
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,780
man into high dimensional space

413
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:23,360
without actually know what the mapping function is because if i defined

414
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,760
a functional form

415
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,960
from the inner product in high dimensional space it implicitly defines a mapping function but

416
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,390
i don't need to know what the mapping function is

417
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:38,690
in other words what i'm saying here is the following i had an part and

418
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,250
this is my map in the product

419
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:47,720
and if i define certain types of kernels they implicitly define certain types of embedding

420
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,700
but i don't need to know what the embedding function is OK

421
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,250
i just find kind of it's OK

422
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:03,200
and i just define a mapping function implicitly define a high dimensional feature space

423
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,820
don't need to bother what that phi x is

424
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,450
it just doesn't matter

425
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,910
so the don't bother and the could this object here is for the country

426
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:17,130
and it is therefore the inner product in of the pairs of points in feature

427
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,320
you don't care about the mapping function yes

428
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:33,140
however which are also seen before and this is not quite right we need to

429
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,370
do or you don't quite understand how to to use the test

430
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,090
born on right

431
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:48,710
she is writing this incredibly hard task but some sense the constraints are somewhat relaxed

432
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,990
and it's easier to get away

433
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,780
on the things

434
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,750
OK so

435
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,270
so in two parts

436
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,160
p on

437
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,890
it seems is so how does this relate back

438
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,790
so just look at some of

439
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,620
and people here are

440
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,770
the universe

441
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:38,030
you have

442
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,590
so is is one of of the

443
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,170
we have

444
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,620
the predominantly

445
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,550
well right after work war

446
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,540
representation of

447
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,140
this framework it can come on go

448
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:08,300
so there's no need

449
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,560
for example see

450
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,110
personal life

451
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,660
i didn't want to just

452
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,190

please contact your first place

00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,210
the small

456
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:38,130
let's more for me because he has forms slide that had

457
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,400
it's cool

458
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,710
he has in a series

459
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,210
well for

460
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,180
what are some of the problems very

461
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,630
we set constraints on the syntax of the language

462
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,500
government can define this email

463
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,920
pos tag

464
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,820
had little little

465
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,300
these are little

466
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,540
british marks interaction

467
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,320
in our

468
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,110
the recent years

469
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,330
one of the four

470
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,170
so he e

471
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,890
services small

472
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,980
four on information that generation size so that small

473
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,190
well that's what are already right

474
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,610
the deed

475
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,400
he was he he

476
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,800
which is the

477
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:50,420
BC xmlschema scheme to

478
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,720
so this is

479
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,730
just this very minimal level performance

480
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,440
are you

481
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:20,660
it is like all one more time now

482
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,070
so there

483
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,190
penalize how much i relaxing so i want to

484
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,650
minimize the sum of slacks

485
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,130
and then i have some smoothness terms

486
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,840
that's that's SVM

487
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,960
now you can turn this into an equivalent form that's

488
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,900
that's an unconstrained optimization problem

489
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:52,630
writing a strange objective here so now concise go away but then you have this

490
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:57,670
objective where f x y is tricks plus b

491
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,460
and then

492
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,920
this class means

493
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,760
we take the

494
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,130
maximum of

495
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,590
this value or zero so we truncated at zero

496
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:16,650
now this is why times as your prediction is known as the marginal basically says

497
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,920
how far away is your prediction from the decision boundary

498
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,980
and it should be possible

499
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,360
if you correct things correctly

500
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,280
if you classified things correctly

501
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,380
you know if it's an active u

502
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,630
classified things wrong

503
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,960
in this

504
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,550
is known as the hinge loss

505
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,960
so we turn this into this is the loss function this is regularizer

506
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,780
turn it into a risk minimisation framework

507
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,630
so that so far is the end

508
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,090
let's look at

509
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,070
the ways we can put in unlabeled data

510
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:01,440
now we do not have labels for the unlabeled data but we can pretend that

511
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,440
we have been pretending other methods so let's pretend that

512
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,260
the sign of my current function

513
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,170
applied to acts

514
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,090
that's my pretend label for acts

515
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,980
when x is unable

516
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,460
now if you put this into

517
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,630
pretend it's label point and put it into the margin formulation and the hinge loss

518
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,960
you see this

519
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:35,530
OK so this is my pretend label but my pretend label times fx is simply

520
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:40,510
the absolute value of f

521
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,170
so you end up with this

522
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:53,150
hinge loss now turns into something like that

523
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:59,460
very easy words simply going to stick them into the SVM

524
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,690
so the black part is the standard SVM

525
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:08,510
but i'm going to adding another term which is on the unlabelled data

526
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,030
and those are

527
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,490
you can view it as the corresponding laws for the unlabelled data

528
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,630
so this is the objective we want to solve

529
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,490
but what is it exactly

530
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,990
so here we go

531
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,400
i'm showing you you

532
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,170
the hinge loss

533
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,190
on the labeled data points

534
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,980
this x axis here is that the marginal

535
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:45,320
remember what i said is if it's on the positive side you have predicted correctly

536
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,070
and in fact

537
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,980
the hinge loss the new term that's the loss incurred in your prediction if you

538
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,900
want to

539
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,150
incur no loss you actually have to predict things not only correctly but confidently so

540
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,650
it has to be bigger than one

541
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:06,440
and then when you're not certain you start to incur some

542
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,490
penalty some loss

543
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,070
and why you predict things wrong you really encourage loss of loss

544
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,730
now let's look at the corresponding unlabelled data term

545
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,710
that one i call it had lost because this function looks very much like a

546
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:28,130
this is a dax instead of y fx because you not know why

547
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,820
now it looks like that where it's zero outside minus one or one but it

548
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,260
has had

549
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,360
minus one and one and it's very large actually at zero

550
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,340
what does it mean if you look at our objective

551
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,990
back here we want to minimize

552
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,210
we hope that every unlabelled data points will get a zero here

553
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,630
that means

554
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,610
every unlabelled data points

555
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,760
should be far away from zero

556
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,610
at least minus one or one way

557
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:09,760
what's zero well zero fx it was zero that's the decision that's the linear decision

558
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,010
so this

559
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:18,190
geometrically really says that i want my unlabelled data points to be outside of my

560
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,960
marginal outside the gap around my decision boundary

561
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,110
OK if i have only with data points near my decision boundary i will incur

562
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,820
some loss

563
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,480
so i don't want that

564
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,070
so that's

565
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:46,610
so that's the intuition behind some surprise support vector machines you simply want to sticking

566
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:50,880
that term unlabelled data to make sure that all the unlabelled data points are far

567
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,630
away from the decision boundary really it's the other way around it should be that

568
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:58,670
you're just your decision boundary that that you will find is far away from all

569
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,940
the unlabelled data

570
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,440
OK so that's the intuition

571
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,260
there is often a somebody here which is that

572
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,570
if you do that if you

573
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,130
optimized this

574
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,750
in many cases

575
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:19,880
the as and being very unbalanced that means that the prediction

576
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,960
it makes usually for the majority of

577
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:27,090
classification makes will fall into one class

578
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:33,260
and as a heuristic people come up with this class balance constraint

579
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,250
which says

580
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,090
i want

581
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,840
predicted labels

582
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,670
using this have

583
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,380
crossfire on my unlabelled data

584
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,730
if you look at

585
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:54,360
so because this is zero one you average them you it's essentially the fraction of

586
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,860
positive labels

587
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,280
you want this to be the same as the fraction of positive labels in the

588
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,670
it has always zero

589
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,990
i've also drawn in here all the shortest paths

590
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,570
this is not hard to do is we're not going to talk about two much

591
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,720
in this class but it's mention little bit more detail in the the textbook

592
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,630
there's something called the shortest path tree is something good to know

593
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,280
that if you actually want to compute shortest paths

594
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,800
in this class we mainly worry about the weights because it's pretty much the same

595
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:37,590
the shortest path tree is the union of all shortest paths and in particular

596
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,300
if you look at

597
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,760
vertex in your graph

598
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,320
and you consider

599
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,380
the last edge

600
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,360
into that vertex that was relaxed

601
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,610
among all vertices u

602
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:00,880
you look at the edges UV so was that the last one relax so just

603
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,440
look at the last is relaxed here you put them all together that's called the

604
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,400
shortest path tree and has the property that

605
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,570
from s to everywhere else there is a unique path down the tree

606
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:15,110
and it's the shortest path is a shortest path that we found

607
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:19,470
OK so you actually get shorter spans this algorithm even though it's not explicitly described

608
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,260
it's mainly talking about the shortest path weights

609
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,940
algorithm clear at this point i feels like it's doing the right thing you can

610
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,690
check all those numbers are the best hands

611
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,510
in our and proof that

612
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:54,190
so the correctness

613
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:07,920
so the first thing i want to prove it is the relaxation never makes a

614
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,510
if it ever sets dv to be something

615
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:15,950
i want to prove that is always an upper bound on delta

616
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:20,550
so we have this invariant

617
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,840
is greater than or equal to

618
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,720
delta as comedy

619
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,860
for all the

620
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,490
and this invariant holds

621
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:41,670
at all times after initialisation

622
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:45,630
it does not before initialisation isn't defined

623
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:50,070
but if you do this initialisation resets to zero and everyone else to infinity

624
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:54,740
and if you take any sequence of relaxation steps

625
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:07,800
and this invariant will hold after each relaxation step you apply

626
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:12,760
this is actually very general one also pretty easy to prove it holds not only

627
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,820
for dexter's other before a lot of other organs will see

628
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,440
these pretty much every other than we see one involve relaxation

629
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:24,320
and this is saying no matter what relaxations you do you always have a reasonable

630
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,440
estimate in this sense is less than or equal to its

631
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,510
greater than or equal to the true shrews pathway so she should be converging from

632
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,010
so that's the lemma

633
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,300
let's prove it

634
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,340
any suggestions on how we should prove this lemma

635
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,550
technique might we use

636
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:51,970
was cut-and-paste would for optimal substructure

637
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,440
cut and paste

638
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,450
he sort of what's going on here but not

639
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,470
not exactly

640
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,280
something a little more general

641
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,510
just intuition here doesn't have to be the right answer

642
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,300
so many answers are correct

643
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,030
i have possible purpose

644
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,070
i'm not going to write induction here but is effectively are using induction and that's

645
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:24,240
the answer i was expecting so this induction already in time going on here say

646
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,170
after initialisation should be true that are base case and then every six relaxation we

647
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:33,170
do which still be true so assume by induction that all the previous relaxations worked

648
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:37,220
and they were own to prove that the last relaxation whatever it is it works

649
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,860
so for system base case

650
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:46,320
so this is after initialisation saying initially

651
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,280
initially we have to ask

652
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,550
equal to zero

653
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,780
and we have to be of the

654
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,850
classical scaling to this

655
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,450
so what you end up with

656
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,570
this picture

657
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,910
which located

658
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,990
after weights

659
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,260
make it look

660
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,530
one of the south also

661
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:28,870
hard to get properly should be flipped over is also a reliable source like

662
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,690
so this is the picture comes out and

663
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,340
there's so much in distortions what

664
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:42,640
basically what's happened is that the places to reflect the road network in britain so

665
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,700
what we have here

666
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,770
these towns

667
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,920
are all on the motorway called the m one

668
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,700
these are all along the one on the the side of country called them six

669
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:59,070
this is what we call them five and so this is the way to

670
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,240
two to do so

671
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,360
what's happening here is the

672
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,960
because the routes recommended along the motorway because that's the fastest

673
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,700
this is fortunate as a short time

674
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,120
what happens is that line or not the geographical position not size geographical positions but

675
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,290
in positions that are related to

676
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:27,230
what was equipped to drive from inside and that's why i can see why signaling

677
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:31,690
network because of from program but

678
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,150
this is something that this is happening is

679
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:40,310
if you actually look problematic approach so bear in mind this is the transpose of

680
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,860
this is

681
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:45,210
this is the west of the country and this is this the country because it

682
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,760
happened to flip it that way round

683
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,230
you have no control over the region

684
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,100
well this parts of the country

685
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,180
is land

686
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,680
on this

687
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,230
it's a

688
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,140
and they are not so what happens here

689
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,690
if you want to this place carmarthen

690
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,090
so for that you can't go

691
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,850
state and because the season

692
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:11,900
so what we have to do is go back to the second down here

693
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:16,120
so what happens here is if you actually look the problem

694
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,880
you find the

695
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,350
this line of terms should really of the time

696
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:25,390
geographically but because the distances to

697
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,450
this part

698
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,300
than the actual geographical distance

699
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,600
this is all being pushed down

700
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,280
further away from here is

701
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,030
if you want to know more

702
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,040
so this is being pushed further and

703
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,620
in order to

704
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:49,460
much the distance is the distance is the which is what

705
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,650
works best

706
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,150
but i would say the things that i can see are the ones of to

707
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:05,830
much the motorway network and its distortions life

708
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,630
thing further away from carmarthen it should be

709
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,490
but this is this is this is a map that reflects the road distances

710
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,960
what was

711
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:21,780
so there is

712
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:28,920
scale into the same problem x the distances

713
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,480
the distances

714
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:35,510
what you're really trying to get is the same old

715
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:40,370
so the same rank ordered distance is not exactly the same so you are saying

716
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,270
that there

717
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,470
the oldest is the assume that you have information that says the

718
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:51,820
a and b for further apart than b c things like that so you to

719
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,130
where the distance on the map from a to b

720
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,720
is bigger than the distinction case well it

721
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,210
measuring the similarity between head is

722
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,230
less than

723
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,380
the similarity

724
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:10,100
but just trying to match the ordering of the dissimilarities

725
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:13,430
the distances that you draw on your

726
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,840
let's so

727
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:19,060
the basic problem is sometimes called chapel to shepherd crystal scaling because

728
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,990
they sort of

729
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,560
cluster analysis which decomposition

730
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:34,480
this analysis is trying to find groups amongst objects trust which objects in all sorts

731
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:38,490
of the the same basic ideas

732
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,060
so so that have indexes as the inputs as before

733
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:49,280
what we want to do is try and identify how we got concentrations of observations

734
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,110
in certain places

735
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,660
two types

736
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,870
are hierarchical which means that

737
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,220
if we have a

738
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,760
clustering that has

739
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:08,020
two clusters in the clustering has three clusters in is hierarchical

740
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,520
then the three the solution must have been obtained by splitting one of the two

741
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,850
clusters in the two cluster solution

742
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:19,690
so that you all the way you think is together with three clusters to two

743
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:23,630
clusters emerged to the three closest together

744
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,900
and gives you two new clusters

745
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,190
non hierarchical as

746
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:33,760
at all on that you can have

747
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:41,860
two clusters and the relationship go to cluster part of relationship three closest to the

748
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,360
hierarchical long

749
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,990
it was often used because it's quicker computationally and the two trips to building hierarchical

750
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:53,220
classification of clustering one is

751
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:58,740
you start off with all the values of the point separately and used it together

752
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,370
so you say choose to stick them together

753
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:04,430
so i suppose you twenty observations

754
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,510
you choose to

755
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:09,940
put them together that give you a nineteen clusters

756
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,020
and then

757
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:17,180
take nineteen clusters and stick to those clusters together to give you a eighteen so

758
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:17,980
that we

759
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:21,130
all the other way around the start this one cluster

760
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,560
i just put it into

761
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:27,730
and then that the two clusters say one or other of those in split into

762
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:34,330
so it's not a good hierarchical

763
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,420
it doesn't have the answer but that we quick

764
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:44,150
computationally the various ways of deciding what the distances between those clusters which are written

765
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:49,060
down here described in more detail in the book about three times

766
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,810
going to rewrite it

767
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:54,610
with the carried along by itself

768
00:46:54,610 --> 00:47:03,540
and now what matrix goes on that's times the

769
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,250
if you could say

770
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:12,860
this this forum is like how undo elimination has had a reversed

771
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:16,770
starting from here what do I do to get back

772
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:20,710
and it just turns out better to have

773
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:26,670
that all the data to have the matrix on 1 side like here and so

774
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:31,000
what matrix try I want to

775
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:37,230
the inverse inverse that's the key point right because because security was here and so

776
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,670
I multiply that through an example

777
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:45,860
the times the CPU time KGB me the you if I multiply through by the

778
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:53,690
inverse of undo the elimination steps that knocks out the thing puts it here so

779
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:58,750
so what I'm asking you is what's the inverse of the mass

780
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:01,880
and you know what the inverse of that

781
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:09,960
it's gets the same matrix from the minus there can we see why that would

782
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:14,860
on we could check that that's so write it down

783
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:20,060
2 1 0 and that's the minus half and I claim that this is this

784
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:24,360
is the inverse but now I'm going to call it its lower triangular and this

785
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,880
is the

786
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,610
and this is of course k

787
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:38,340
at I think where it important like we were coming quite a bit here in

788
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,690
In our but

789
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:48,560
we can use the Y inward sort of why the inverse matrix

790
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,480
the inverse operation

791
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:57,340
should be this guy with a sign change

792
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,670
and at the same site you can check that that matrix times that many cruise

793
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:06,690
gives the identity they they they are inverses of each other but we added half

794
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,710
we take away good good good exactly

795
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:13,920
exactly that's that's the word I'm looking for

796
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,690
this step added a half of this wrote that

797
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:21,670
and so if we want to inverted what I'm doing

798
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:26,790
subtract half of this role from the numbers right

799
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:30,980
back to where we were OK so I'm happy to have it on this side

800
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,980
actually I'm happy for multiple reasons

801
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:42,940
yeah which about what the media that we just saw emphasize that this is a

802
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:48,040
great place to have not only 1 thing I'd like to improve here and tell

803
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:52,950
and that is

804
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,770
that I've lost the symmetry

805
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:03,360
this was a symmetric matrix that that's 2 important properties to give up on

806
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,790
so I was like to my factorizations

807
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:12,090
should be a somehow symmetric factorisation

808
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:17,520
and the 1 way to do now I'm totally happy with

809
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:25,670
and now another factor out here

810
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:31,190
a diagonal matrix it just shows the pivots 2 and 3 halves

811
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:37,730
the alright so that's an easy it's nice to have a diagonal matrix

812
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,310
could be better than that and then

813
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,670
I got something like

814
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:45,880
so if you see what I'm doing is I'm taking this matrix

815
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:52,230
dividing that row by 2 and dividing that by 3 halves so that I get

816
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:56,250
this simple orthogonal matrix that only has 1 there

817
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:59,000
and of course it's going to 0 there now now you just tell me what's

818
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,320
there and really

819
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:08,130
social what did I do

820
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:13,820
I that just divided into the 3 have just came out so that was this

821
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:19,290
row divided by 2 divided by the pivot separated out the pivot so let me

822
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:24,000
with the 1 on the main diagonal and what's here

823
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:29,020
minus the head right because the 2 will multiply minus haven't give me the minus

824
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:35,590
development give you a chance to look at that because I'm going pretty quickly

825
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,000
that's the form of a woman

826
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,130
of no completes now

827
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:46,360
that's the form that

828
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,190
that we're shooting for

829
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:51,920
the matrix has been factored into a lower triangular

830
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,770
1 that has these multipliers it

831
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:59,130
a diagonal that has the pivots it

832
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:05,380
and then upper triangular and what's special about this upper upper triangular

833
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,190
it's the transpose of the lower

834
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:12,500
so that this factorization is now

835
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:19,820
symmetrised space we've got pull out the diagonal and we were left with the transpose

836
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,310
of the 1st

837
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:28,230
and that's great I mean that's the right way to have a symmetric matrix because

838
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:32,090
I made it every l times the impact

839
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,360
the next

840
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,690
several hours

841
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:40,090
are going to be about products of 3 matrices

842
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:45,440
outside factors are transposes of each other

843
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,360
that's always a symmetric result

844
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,190
if I take a matrix

845
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,860
time something in the middle

846
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,900
times the transpose of the 1st

847
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,670
that has not not matrix product is symmetric

848
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:09,580
and in this case the factor is lower triangular that factor is diagonal so long

849
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,750
that's great

850
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:17,840
but can we just checking can we see general fact white I claim that whatever

851
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:21,630
l and might happen to be

852
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:29,150
that products of this this triple symmetric triple product you could call it

853
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:34,110
produces that was is the result of a symmetric matrix how can I check that

854
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,860
the result is a symmetric matrix it looks kind of

855
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,940
I think it's transpose literary

856
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,980
me right

857
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,320
we want to know if something is symmetric

858
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:50,920
tickets transpose and see what

859
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,810
if we get again

860
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:58,110
In the case we got a symmetric matrix OK so it takes a transpose so

861
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:05,340
this is like offline here because there was a wealth or I'll put it in

862
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:10,860
here and so what is the transpose of this thing so I have a product

863
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:14,310
of 3 things I want to transpose

864
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,290
so this is

865
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:19,500
this is a little chance that the result is always symmetric

866
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:24,630
OK what happens when you take the transpose of several things multiplied together and you

867
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,480
take the transpose of

868
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,620
what's going on

869
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,500
all along this line

870
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,930
so i was our equals one we get

871
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,350
o along this line at this rate

872
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:39,870
he was there already

873
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:44,940
you see what's happening as our goes to one well it's true that this

874
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:49,120
went to zero but this also went to zero in fact faster

875
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,100
the thing is going up

876
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:54,440
now is this one more

877
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:59,540
the place here in the circle is the centre what's the what's the value of

878
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:04,520
you at the center of the circle

879
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:08,250
what do i get free you have the right here at the centre

880
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:12,890
there are zero yes all this stuff is gone i only get

881
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:17,620
one or two pi and what's interesting about the answer one or two pi

882
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,330
was one over so you at the centre zero zero

883
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,350
there's one or two pi

884
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:27,580
and then what is that what's the message there

885
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:33,020
it's the average of view around the boundary

886
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,210
and this is like always true

887
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:38,270
that the solution of classes equation

888
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:39,730
at any point

889
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:43,790
is the average of the

890
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:46,060
we have our around in a circle

891
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:50,710
so at that point take any circle i could actually take other circles

892
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,080
there's the centre

893
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:57,890
well you have my OK in saying that one or two pi is the average

894
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:02,710
of the delta function that that ask to to

895
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,250
distributed over the circle

896
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:13,440
what would be the solution suppose there was a constant all the way around

897
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,290
i suppose i suppose in the case which should have different boundary conditions for the

898
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:22,330
battery condition was you equal one all the way around

899
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:27,350
what would be the solution that

900
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:31,770
i'm looking for something that's all the possible creation and it was you know it

901
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:34,020
was one of the whole boundary

902
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,270
we can tell me that right away

903
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:40,410
it's going to be one the cost what are tell me is so suppose you

904
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:45,250
were the one on the top half and zero on the bottom OK what would

905
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,660
be the temperature

906
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,770
for me the temperature if i have a circular

907
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:53,640
block here and i he the top

908
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:55,790
semi circle to one

909
00:56:55,810 --> 00:57:00,960
and hold the bottom semi-circle zero what will be the temperature

910
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,230
say at the centre

911
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:08,890
it would be a half and half will be exactly be the average value of

912
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:11,750
one and zero ground sort

913
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,710
actually it will be a half of the way along here

914
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,430
what it will be

915
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,710
and the rest hold

916
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,160
we can figure out some formula but it won't be

917
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:26,040
totally simple i think will be

918
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,890
completely simple anyway

919
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:30,390
we're in a position to solve

920
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,730
plus equations

921
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,690
in a circle

922
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:42,600
this by knowing this answer for the delta function

923
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:48,250
i could and and so that the key points to maybe mention or

924
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:57,390
our first that and the value in every point will be the average of the

925
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:01,580
values any circle around that point so

926
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,520
the solution inside is

927
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:11,140
there's a maximum principle that is worth mentioning the maximal where will the maximum value

928
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:14,660
of u occurred

929
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:19,930
if if my statement is true which it is that from the pluses equation the

930
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:22,580
value at the centre of any circle

931
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:28,020
is the average value around the circle now saying look at the big circle where

932
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,060
will the maximum value of u

933
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,140
someone on the boundary

934
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,890
you could occur inside

935
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,770
this is the maximum can occur there because it's the present value of the other

936
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:46,120
point is the average of all those

937
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,310
so there could be bigger than all these points

938
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:52,660
and those could be bigger than all the points around them

939
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,270
so the only place

940
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:55,810
can be biggest

941
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:59,430
is out of the boundaries well of course in this example is really the biggest

942
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:02,350
it's it's almost completely

943
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:05,140
but so that's the general

944
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:13,140
interesting fact that this maximum principle and of course it makes total sense if

945
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,480
now delta function centred at would put sources

946
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,370
so this this maximum principle applies to any

947
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:24,770
and the

948
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:26,940
any EU equal

949
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:31,620
he is given on the boundary

950
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,100
on boundary

951
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:40,350
so it's totally natural suppose i have my circle

952
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:44,730
and i hold the boundary at certain temperatures

953
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:49,080
and what would you tell me about the temperature inside

954
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:52,140
it's going to be in between right

955
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:56,190
the temperature inside is going to be in between if i all the time varying

956
00:59:56,190 --> 01:00:04,190
temperature here maybe varies from three degrees to fifty five degrees and inside it will

957
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:07,890
b somewhere between three and fifty five an not accuracy see of fifty fifty six

958
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:12,060
degree temperature inside if there are no sourced

959
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,600
that's one thing here no sourced

960
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:19,120
so i've got to have had the chance to dimension the maximum principle and the

961
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:21,390
idea that i could

962
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:26,910
the temperature will vary according to whatever i like on the outside the inside it's

963
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:28,580
a lot smoother

964
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:30,870
one of the

965
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:35,280
there we have it we have a quantitative relation between energy and wavelength

966
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:38,230
one EV is tantamount to six meters

967
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:44,930
we have a quantitative relations energy and temperature one EV is ten thousand degrees

968
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,860
so if you like to say if i had something ten thousand degrees i have

969
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,900
the potential to be able to resolve things on the micron scale

970
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:55,400
what do these things may well let's see

971
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,410
i showed you a moment ago

972
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,980
the scale of distance on which various things you might want to look at are

973
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,040
and so we could see them with ordinary light

974
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,220
i've now added to that list

975
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,180
what the

976
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:11,810
energy corresponding to these distances is

977
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:15,050
using those numbers that i just showed you

978
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:20,740
and you see that the wavelength of light corresponds to energies of the order of

979
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,200
and EV

980
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:25,590
and we'll see in a moment or two

981
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:27,290
even more about this

982
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:31,620
so if you want to source that will provide you energies on the EV scale

983
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,650
it will tend to produce light is visible

984
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:38,880
the distance scales to the atomic nucleus

985
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:41,350
turner energy terms to correspond to

986
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,920
hundred MTV to achieve a

987
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:47,620
so if you want to probe the atomic nucleus you need to have been of

988
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,340
the order of the gv

989
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,640
and that is where we were fifty years ago

990
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:56,050
the highest energy accelerators and a few gv

991
01:01:56,050 --> 01:02:00,590
they were able to study the atomic nucleus and how it works

992
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,890
if you want to get to distances

993
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,880
of ten to the minus eighteen metres

994
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,560
the distance scales with the quarks inside

995
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:11,530
the protons and neutrons live

996
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:14,360
you need to have any scales of the order of

997
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:18,350
TV which is the energy scale we are now to particle physics so you're seeing

998
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:22,480
here now for the first time how energy scales in particle physics correspond to the

999
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,580
distance scales you can resolve

1000
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:30,100
if you want to get to what's called the plank length which is

1001
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:33,130
theoretically with quantum gravity takes over

1002
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:37,490
this the scale of length that you can form using planks constant of quantum

1003
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:42,000
the velocity of light in relativity and g gravitation

1004
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:45,070
that corresponds to the march thirty five metres

1005
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,430
and resolved that you need energy energies of ten to twenty

1006
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:53,030
and if you want to know how far away that is

1007
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:55,590
starting from an EV

1008
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:58,950
then the LHC isn't even halfway

1009
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,390
so it's out of all possible ways of doing our experiments on so i shall

1010
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:09,010
be working and talking only north of the TV line

1011
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:12,060
let's go back to my original

1012
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,140
little picture

1013
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,440
we show the universe in temperature energy and time

1014
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:17,810
and try to

1015
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,560
put these ideas together

1016
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:21,280
to see

1017
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:26,730
what is really telling us

1018
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:32,080
so out there in the space is it's very very cold three degrees kelvin

1019
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:35,030
the thermometer in the middle

1020
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,590
energy scales

1021
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:42,720
and the template is in blue next other the thames that correspond to those energy

1022
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:48,080
scales as i said one EV correspond to ten thousand degrees which indeed is what

1023
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,790
we've got to find the EV

1024
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:54,260
on the scale that ten thousand degrees next to it

1025
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,960
one cave corresponds to

1026
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:00,140
ten to seven degrees

1027
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,240
and these

1028
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:05,510
numbers begin to make sense because you see that the sun

1029
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:08,600
the heart of the sun ten to seven degrees

1030
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:10,200
the seven degrees

1031
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:15,360
a practical nuclear physics laboratory is nuclear fusion going on in the centre of it

1032
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:20,550
and the energy scale of the nuclear reactions taking place are typically on the cave

1033
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:27,830
the sum is burning temperatures typically of those orders let's go back down to the

1034
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,370
bottom of the thermometer

1035
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:32,920
we started off with millie a little and

1036
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:35,440
millie electoral-vote thousand electron volts

1037
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:41,250
is the energy scale which corresponds to typically room temperature in fact one fortieth of

1038
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,390
electron volt

1039
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:44,720
corresponds to room temperature

1040
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:50,120
now put your hand on your head from moment and you'll feel warmth

1041
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,880
that warmth is being produced by your breakfast

1042
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:56,080
when you eat stuff

1043
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:00,880
and a little bit of e equals MC squared in your cornflakes or bread or

1044
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,970
whatever you had is being converted into energy

1045
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:05,650
it is

1046
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:08,000
chemical reactions taking place

1047
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:08,910
in your body

1048
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,440
where the molecules

1049
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:17,710
are rearranging themselves these reactions are acting on the melee EV scale

1050
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,860
and the temperature is energies that are being produced on the three hundred degrees

1051
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:25,570
the scale of kelvin that's body warmth

1052
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:28,870
now if we turn out the lights in this room

1053
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,400
we wouldn't be able to see each other

1054
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,810
but if we had an infrared camera

1055
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:37,600
it was show us all sitting here by the infrared radiation that we're meeting

1056
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:39,210
because in

1057
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:41,070
length scale

1058
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:47,350
temperatures of three hundred degrees kelvin corresponds to the infrared wavelengths

1059
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:49,740
the the electromagnetic radiation

1060
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,730
so begins to hold together room temperature

1061
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:55,960
chemical reactions of molecules

1062
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:00,310
infrared radiation in wavelength

1063
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:04,090
if you now increase the temperature what happens

1064
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:09,030
well the wavelength go down into the infrared radiation you now move into the

1065
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,330
visible region if you turn on for example

1066
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:15,840
bar radiator

1067
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:19,820
the first you will feel the warmth and it'll start glowing red it gets hotter

1068
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:25,040
it will glow red yellow as it moves through the optical spectrum these like sunshine

1069
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:28,880
because the filaments are many thousands of degrees

1070
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:31,960
they are the temperatures

1071
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:36,370
where the energy is on out of the order of EV

1072
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,380
and the wavelengths in the optical region

1073
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,320
you're not getting the individual electrons in atoms being excited at the atomic level rather

1074
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,970
than just the rather loosely bound molecules

1075
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:52,130
if you nothing to your atoms

1076
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:56,910
the temperatures beyond ten thousand degrees what happens

1077
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,560
all the electrons in the atom

1078
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:01,850
after being given so much energy

1079
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,290
the temperature

1080
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:06,430
but they can no longer hold themselves out the at

1081
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:09,370
of the atoms become ionized

1082
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,060
the former plasma

1083
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:14,870
electrons and protons flying around independently

1084
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,100
those are the conditions you find the sun

1085
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:19,610
by the time you get some sense

1086
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:21,950
but it's all pretty simple

1087
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:25,180
so written down and say

1088
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:29,120
what they really mean is for properties

1089
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:38,420
the first one is pretty simple every node is either red or black

1090
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:44,260
that's the hence the name of a red black trees

1091
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:48,490
so the color field is just a single bit specifying red or black

1092
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:52,210
and red nodes i'm going to denote by double circle because i don't have a

1093
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:56,000
color chart here and black nodes will be a single circle and you probably have

1094
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,660
colored pens either so save us

1095
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:02,040
some grief

1096
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:03,470
credits double circle

1097
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:08,250
black is a single circle we search for black nodes in some sense right nodes

1098
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:10,980
are pain will see

1099
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:13,190
OK so can property

1100
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:16,410
is the room

1101
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:17,920
and the leaves

1102
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:22,790
are all black

1103
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:32,910
and i'm going to pull little trick your

1104
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:35,840
tree binary search is a little bit differently than we have in the past

1105
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:38,260
normally think of the tree

1106
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,110
as of nodes each node could have

1107
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:44,180
zero or one or two children something like this

1108
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,120
i'm going to imagine a pending

1109
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:51,920
every place where node does not have a child i'm going to put a little

1110
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,530
dots here and external which which i call so normally these would have been these

1111
01:08:56,530 --> 01:09:00,140
items and is going to have to every absent

1112
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:04,960
child pointer a new belief this will be my leaves these are really the nail

1113
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,840
pointers from each of these

1114
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:13,430
so now every internal node has exactly two children and everybody has their children

1115
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:16,690
so these are the doesn't refer to these guys are black

1116
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:19,430
and the is black

1117
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:22,740
according to rule two

1118
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:26,720
now the produced a little bit more interesting

1119
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:33,530
the parent every right now

1120
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,080
is one

1121
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:41,730
so whenever i have

1122
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:43,440
right now

1123
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,140
its parent has to be

1124
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:49,360
black a single circle

1125
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:53,060
so in other words if you look at

1126
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:54,440
path in the tree

1127
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:56,460
you can never have too red nodes

1128
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:58,350
consecutive has to be

1129
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:02,360
can most often a red black right back you can have several blackman's consecutive but

1130
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,890
never to that's

1131
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,840
and then one more rule

1132
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:10,980
this is a little bit more about such hands

1133
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:21,400
so if we take a simple path meaning it doesn't appear vertices from a node

1134
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,520
has access to a

1135
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:27,580
descendant leaf

1136
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:41,760
all such as all descendant leaves

1137
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:45,030
have the same number of black nodes on

1138
01:10:45,070 --> 01:11:06,620
so let me draw a picture we have some tree we have some node x

1139
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:10,980
looking at all the paths from x

1140
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:15,500
down to some descendant leaf down here at the bottom of the tree

1141
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:20,700
all these has should have the same number of black nodes so hero drop each

1142
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,770
one has

1143
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:30,150
black nodes leaf and three about it

1144
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:35,660
we know that these from property three these nodes don't have at most half of

1145
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:39,890
the nodes are red is whenever whenever another parent must be black

1146
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:45,070
but i want all these passive exactly the same number of black nodes one cell

1147
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:49,430
see here is that the black i didn't really

1148
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:51,420
the rooms are already here

1149
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:58,640
this should be the same for all has but in particular the count i'm interested

1150
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,140
in does not include x itself

1151
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:14,940
OK so if x is black only calling the black-eyed so the black box is

1152
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:16,550
this count for

1153
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,390
and even if x is black

1154
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,570
the black eyed for these are just some minor

1155
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,920
to get all of the

1156
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:31,160
algorithms typically so let's look at the example of a red black tree

1157
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:38,710
so i training example and also why we care about these properties

1158
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:44,300
if you put all the UV light again two responses

1159
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:50,140
if you look more carefully you can identify the best first effect is simply family

1160
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:53,100
take due to the dominant heating of you die

1161
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,670
with the laser light source

1162
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:59,580
in the network and the second process

1163
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,100
actually is

1164
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:06,810
this is cis trans of francis i summarisation process if you put up the light

1165
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:11,200
from the effect and then this is france as summarisation process

1166
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:18,480
works perfectly as predicted more or less biased the simple model just discussed

1167
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:24,290
however if you look at the time scale here it's thousands of seconds

1168
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:27,770
of course the question is whether this might be suitable for

1169
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:31,070
and artificial muscle would be a little bit too slow

1170
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:35,960
it's not an argument

1171
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,050
because it's when known

1172
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:44,280
these molecules cute that we use for the census friends i summarisation process

1173
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:50,400
can be nicely modified and you can get very fast response within milliseconds and for

1174
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,180
example very recently peter p

1175
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,650
published a paper with these networks

1176
01:13:55,710 --> 01:14:03,560
he which shine light on these samples and the reaction time was within milliseconds

1177
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,490
the brothers where

1178
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:08,290
on the water surface and

1179
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:12,180
the area

1180
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,940
well the light shined on

1181
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:19,350
into the dark and therefore because this paper a fast liquid crystalline elastomers swims into

1182
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:25,840
the dock which if find here in there in this paper

1183
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:28,770
another interesting aspect

1184
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:33,080
the optical properties of liquid crystals and you just one example

1185
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:35,890
i think one of the most fascinating

1186
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:42,590
the properties of the so-called karen the medical cholesteric phase is the selective reflection of

1187
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:44,990
circularly polarized light

1188
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:52,960
cholesteric phase of current nematic phase is simply continuously twisted nematic phase perpendicular to the

1189
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,430
direction twisted

1190
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:57,290
and due to the helical structure

1191
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:06,030
this cholesteric structure reflex circularly polarized light where the wavelength of reflection is directly proportional

1192
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:10,370
the periodicity of this helical factor

1193
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,960
the problem of course is when we look for elastomers

1194
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:16,420
can we prepare

1195
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,650
such a nice cholesteric last summer with these

1196
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,890
optical properties

1197
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:28,050
liquid crystal elastomers

1198
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:32,180
let's for example start with

1199
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:34,810
system where we have

1200
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:41,930
correspondingly corresponding nematic phase with the paul a chain confirmation

1201
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:46,000
in other words locally polar chain confirmation

1202
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:51,300
then we see that due to the helical structure the over all chain confirmation of

1203
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,330
such a network which should behave like

1204
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:55,880
single crystal

1205
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:59,110
a global chain confirmation should be oblate

1206
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:04,620
in other words to realize such a microscopically orders sam

1207
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:10,290
we need an over all obligate chain confirmation as mentioned in the beginning

1208
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:11,900
and this simply

1209
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,430
means that you have

1210
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,420
to do either compression uniaxial compression

1211
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:20,000
or by accident information

1212
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:26,680
unfortunately both experiments are extremely difficult to perform you would see it in the moment

1213
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:32,950
the next question of course is when we take our network if we introduce action

1214
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:37,420
global optimal chain confirmation do we actually see

1215
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:42,900
such as spontaneous twist which causes the helical superstructure

1216
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:47,380
in other words this the this coupling to the network

1217
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,800
we succeeded in getting these networks

1218
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:59,850
and here you see a small sample of such cholesteric network the reflection weight links

1219
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:00,890
should be

1220
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:02,130
in the

1221
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:05,180
a yellow to orange

1222
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:08,980
immediately can see that this is not a nice reflection colour

1223
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:14,320
which is expected for cholesteric phase nevertheless the concept works

1224
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:17,290
at least get

1225
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:27,210
or perfectly ordered no a center which is interestingly microscopically or in other words everything

1226
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:29,310
seems to work

1227
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:34,000
now when we take such a network and when we additionally

1228
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:37,470
by x information or uniaxial compression

1229
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:43,400
then of course this means that the helicopters structure is compressed of the network which

1230
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:49,410
caused a ship of the of the wavelength of reflection into the blue region and

1231
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:50,530
this weekend

1232
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:54,790
and if we

1233
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:57,920
properly measure the wavelengths for as reflections

1234
01:17:57,970 --> 01:18:02,810
and if we measure the thickness and the change of the thickness of the sample

1235
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:06,540
then we see that this an find information

1236
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:12,140
the helicopter the page with the macroscopic dimension of the network by the way here

1237
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:16,900
you see that you never realised to get the nice by x deformation

1238
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:18,130
it's also

1239
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:22,830
a company with shear deformation in the borderlands of the network

1240
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:25,380
and it's much

1241
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:32,630
difficult to realize such a perfect by excerpt information you need at least many many

1242
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:35,350
claims to get the perfect

1243
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:38,720
the formation of the network

1244
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:44,390
when we analyse nevertheless when we analyse the wavelength of reflection we see

1245
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,150
that there

1246
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:49,530
reflection bend of our networks is extremely broad

1247
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:55,110
here in comparison you see the same system as the low wall must liquid crystals

1248
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:59,190
and the width of the reflection bent is extremely narrow compared

1249
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:03,900
to our network the question was what's the reason why don't we observe such a

1250
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:09,230
nice orientation of the system there must be some people and here we get such

1251
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:10,610
get some

1252
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:12,400
nice help

1253
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:16,130
from michelle meet all the

1254
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,360
he has done some

1255
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,670
electron microscopic pictures of our

1256
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:23,800
polymer networks

1257
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:25,480
and you could see

1258
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:33,150
that we do not get a nice orientation of plains of equal director orientation but

1259
01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:34,800
there's obviously

1260
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:38,570
on the relation with in this typical cholesteric structure

1261
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:44,130
let me explain this dark region simply mean that our right like molecules on average

1262
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:47,380
looking in this direction like regimes

1263
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:51,150
parallel in other words here we have this helicopter structure

1264
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:53,360
we see the clear

1265
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:56,290
periodicity of the cholesteric phase

1266
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:57,710
and this should be

1267
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:03,000
and i explained which can be observed for low molar mass system following network we

1268
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,840
see it doesn't work

1269
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:09,400
question was what's the reason and it's a long story to make a long story

1270
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:16,750
to get perfectly ordered systems we completely change our chemistry and start with the chemistry

1271
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:18,340
which was already

1272
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:22,500
test part of the system by fiat always and russia

1273
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:26,570
and the order of ten to the university of mines

1274
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:27,550
we took

1275
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:29,860
of liquid crystal and polymers

1276
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:32,250
some functional groups

1277
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:38,420
the system begins to condense into this are well defined is larger but the entropy

1278
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:45,490
is smaller and therefore this cause fluctuations are negative and hence the cooperation from expansion

1279
01:20:45,490 --> 01:20:46,870
goes negative

1280
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:51,440
so there are three of the sixty four numbers that easily rationalised in terms of

1281
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:55,940
predictive non-animal is one of the more dramatic things is that this is the essence

1282
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:59,460
of this argument relies on two lengthscales of potential

1283
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:03,960
liquids with local tetrahedral symmetry such as silicon

1284
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:05,270
and so can

1285
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:06,990
two of the most common

1286
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:13,340
things on should also have a liquid liquid transition in very very recent work in

1287
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:14,540
nature physics

1288
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:18,090
and elsewhere shows that seems to be the case

1289
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:24,620
how can we tested this experimentally this experiment never simple and

1290
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,550
we learn in

1291
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:32,780
in the matrix that that that if we look at the phase diagram of a

1292
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:35,400
simple flow could point

1293
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,210
the to

1294
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:43,330
critical point the first order line but the one nothing is singular that's not strictly

1295
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:49,630
true nothing may be mathematically singular but if we make any quantity that susceptible to

1296
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:55,770
the proportion the fluctuations let's take the specific heat here then this was severely rises

1297
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:56,720
and drops

1298
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:03,080
very dramatically and has appeared as we crossed the we demand with the binary recall

1299
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:10,050
few was the locus of the maximum of correlation length and what causes rising fluctuations

1300
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:13,390
is to right the way to mine the system is

1301
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:17,610
mainly of fuel liquid clusters inside sea of grass

1302
01:22:17,610 --> 01:22:22,650
on the right and the it's the reverse if fuel gas clusters into cyrillic and

1303
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:30,740
here is the maximum of correlation length is the compensation point between those two scenarios

1304
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:38,960
how to make this experimentally and the coexistence line is very difficult to see

1305
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:45,100
but the winter because of of metastability but the world is very easy to see

1306
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:48,050
and now it's very easy to see all

1307
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:50,430
to be honest because they're all alone

1308
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:53,840
temperature of homogeneous nucleation of by

1309
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:58,280
using manual confined water

1310
01:22:58,290 --> 01:23:00,670
the hydrogen bond network cannot form

1311
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:07,780
and therefore the system does not freeze homogeneous nucleation temperature an example of very recent

1312
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:14,450
work recently submitted to nature physics is the analysis of model matches for transform infrared

1313
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:21,510
experiments in which one can actually play as a function of temperature the relative population

1314
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:24,020
of this low-density liquid right

1315
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:28,230
the geometry is and you can see there already roughly

1316
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:32,670
the temperature of maximum density four celcius to begin to be

1317
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:38,620
the significant number of droplets of the low-density liquid is the compensation point when the

1318
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:42,440
system crosses the line roughly two twenty five

1319
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:47,040
and a saturation of our temperatures

1320
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,480
this is one of

1321
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:54,350
perhaps two dozen reason experiments carried out in the last year or two by my

1322
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:56,830
much in messina and by chan

1323
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:57,960
at MIT

1324
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:58,940
which all

1325
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:05,540
converge and providing fourteen pieces of evidence favoring this liquid liquid phase transition

1326
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:10,840
one will always has to worry about everything one of the biggest one about

1327
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:15,950
all these experiments is that there are carried out in a confined geometry which means

1328
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:20,880
the walls are so it can affect the nature of the way

1329
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:26,420
in particular the water and even pure here so can well so i can well

1330
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:32,930
and therefore experiments have been redone for water near proteins and in particular

1331
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:39,430
there are places lysozyme and DNA and what one finds is not surprisingly is the

1332
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:46,790
famous protein glass transition which means the mean squared displacement suffered a major key at

1333
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:49,250
a temperature of around twenty

1334
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:57,790
and similarly the characteristic relaxation time and goes across from not years fragile behaviour through

1335
01:24:57,790 --> 01:24:59,460
i mean strong behaviour

1336
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:02,120
at the same temperature

1337
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:08,360
these experiments have not been reinterpreted not in terms of protein glass transition in terms

1338
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,310
of the cross-over

1339
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:16,460
in the properties of the thin skin of water that surrounds the biomolecules from the

1340
01:25:16,490 --> 01:25:20,980
predominantly high-density liquid local configuration of the red line

1341
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:26,440
to predominantly low-density liquid configuration below the window line

1342
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:32,090
so let's summarize this part of the talk what is complex because the

1343
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:38,120
charged the that comprise water give rise to a phase transition line separating two liquid

1344
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:43,280
phases and terminating at a critical point the fact that critical point is the paternal

1345
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:49,120
these are usually called the critical region around the critical points and that perturbation gives

1346
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,480
rise to the anomalies of one

1347
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:57,390
about this is was first found by simulations of a graduate student at is now

1348
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:59,520
confirmed by experiments

1349
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:06,430
the protein drug transition is not protein that does not transition but rather crossover and

1350
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,600
something i have not talked about because it's very recent

1351
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:13,270
just reported the gordon conferences shares worker modelling now

1352
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:20,780
showing that the low-density liquid is very relevant in nucleation because the first beginnings of

1353
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:28,450
thank you very much for this flattering introduction and thank you all the organisers for

1354
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:29,560
inviting me here

1355
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:34,480
it's actually quite special for me to speak here in oregon because i spent some

1356
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:38,030
time in oregon as a student going to school year so it was the first

1357
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:39,880
time that i really got to know american

1358
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,500
i feel a bit like student again in oregon

1359
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,080
so i i i decided taste

1360
01:26:46,090 --> 01:26:48,990
the title of my talk and talk about

1361
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:51,470
four things basically components

1362
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:56,400
some applications of kernels i'll talk about something called kernel means will come later

1363
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:01,250
will become clear later what i mean by this and finally i try to put

1364
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:03,780
things a little bit into perspective

1365
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:06,810
most of you probably heard about this thing called the kernel trick

1366
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:11,910
by talking about how this country has evolved over the years how we thought of

1367
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:14,420
it at the beginning how we think of it now it's also a little bit

1368
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:16,220
related to the

1369
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:20,420
the actual content of this talk so part of this talk will be

1370
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:23,760
well known to most of you know try to cut very short it will be

1371
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,060
may the first five or ten minutes so if you sleepy that's that's your chance

1372
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:32,950
afterwards are talk about some applications that some of you may have seen others may

1373
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:33,490
not have c

1374
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:37,930
and finally they don't talk about something that i hope maybe the majority view hasn't

1375
01:27:37,930 --> 01:27:40,140
seen yet

1376
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:42,890
these are the first

1377
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:47,270
five or ten minutes not so start with an example of a very simple pattern

1378
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:52,260
recognition algorithms where we are given two classes of data the classes and the circles

1379
01:27:52,710 --> 01:27:57,750
and we try to classify new point x based on whether it's closer to the

1380
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,990
mean of one class

1381
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:03,890
denoted mu plus so this is the mean of the one class or closer to

1382
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:08,270
the mean of the other class denoted mu minus which is over here so obviously

1383
01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:12,350
this induces a separating hyperplane is the decision function

1384
01:28:12,650 --> 01:28:17,150
with the normal vector that's the vector connecting these two class means

1385
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:20,970
but of course this only solves problems that are linearly separable

1386
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:25,840
and the kernel approaches then to preprocess the inputs with some mapping that takes our

1387
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:30,850
input domain into a dot product space and then we work in that space

1388
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:34,880
what is that helpful what can that help here's an example of a two dimensional

1389
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:40,210
classification problem separating these crosses from the samples we assume the true decision boundary this

1390
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:43,690
is this ellipse but we don't know what we only have the data now if

1391
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:49,110
we pre processed all points by computing all features of all the two product of

1392
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:49,480
order two

1393
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:54,130
and then this problem becomes linearly separable which you can see by reading the ellipse

1394
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:57,680
equation in these new coordinates

1395
01:28:57,690 --> 01:29:03,380
now the trick comes in when we see that if we take two such points

1396
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:07,280
x x trying to two-dimensional points we mapped them into the three dimensional space using

1397
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:12,040
this prescription when we then take the dot product we see that this gives simple

1398
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:16,520
binomial formula we can simplify it right is the square the product in the original

1399
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:21,380
so that's an example of a simple kernel we can compute the dot product without

1400
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:26,800
going into this high dimensional space same thing works for n dimensional inputs and products

1401
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,300
of order p

1402
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:30,950
in this case we end up with this polynomial kernel

1403
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:37,000
physically something similar works for all positive definite kernels of the notion well known in

1404
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:41,590
mathematics and whenever we have such a positive definite kernel we can prove there exist

1405
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:46,630
some mapping into another space so mapping five such that the kernel computes the dot

1406
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:48,130
product in that space

1407
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:54,250
in one way of visualizing the mapping is by thinking of it as a mapping

1408
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:56,500
into a function space

1409
01:29:56,860 --> 01:30:01,660
so we define the mapping to take up input point x into the kernel centered

1410
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:05,280
on that point x o for instance if we used a gaussian kernel then this

1411
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,960
point x would be mapped into a gaussian function

1412
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:10,620
sitting on the point x

1413
01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:15,490
another point prime will be mapped into goes in and all space will be defined

1414
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:20,490
to be the linear how complete completion of the linear i love these kinds of

1415
01:30:20,810 --> 01:30:22,510
maps functions

1416
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:25,850
and then we have to define what's the product in that space

1417
01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:31,030
and we have to define it such that it satisfies this equality because we want

1418
01:30:31,030 --> 01:30:36,310
to compute the product turns out this works we can define this it's defined we

1419
01:30:36,910 --> 01:30:38,910
extended linearly

1420
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:44,630
and we then have a kernel that computes the dot product in this function space

1421
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:48,400
in one of the nice things about of this kernel is if you substitute came

1422
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:52,160
here and you do the same thing for linear combinations you will see that the

1423
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:57,670
kernel represents point evaluation on these functions so it this i mean if i have

1424
01:30:57,670 --> 01:30:59,260
a function in that space so this

1425
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:02,740
at this point it's just abstract element of a hilbert space if i want to

1426
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:05,980
know the value of this function at some point x the only thing i have

1427
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:09,670
to do is take this other element of a hilbert space which is the kernel

1428
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:10,790
sitting on x

1429
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,640
compute the dot product between the two

1430
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:14,750
and that was my point evaluation

1431
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:16,100
and here i have one

1432
01:31:17,530 --> 01:31:18,530
this one

1433
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,270
the velocity v one

1434
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:24,900
and and this one has velocity v two one-dimensional problems

1435
01:31:24,910 --> 01:31:27,550
a warm-up

1436
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,090
the plough into each other

1437
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,340
they stick together

1438
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:34,210
i put some good ones

1439
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:38,230
and so to stick together to give you have to accept that

1440
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:39,840
this week

1441
01:31:39,850 --> 01:31:42,230
the direction of increasing x

1442
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:44,640
before the collision

1443
01:31:44,650 --> 01:31:47,350
i have a certain amount of movement and i can do is on the horizontal

1444
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:51,860
which is frictionless i can do it on the ice surface which is nearly frictionless

1445
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:54,010
and i ignore and drag

1446
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:57,320
so this is the situation before

1447
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,470
so the momentum that i have before

1448
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,330
he calls and one v one

1449
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:06,910
this is my plus direction i could support vectors over there but that's really not

1450
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:10,190
necessary because it's a one-dimensional problems

1451
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,890
plus and two

1452
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,610
the two like that

1453
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:16,170
my guess

1454
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:18,330
that's the momentum before

1455
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:20,220
now they stick together

1456
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:24,650
so when they stick together the total mass is in one place and two

1457
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:25,670
and then

1458
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:27,280
their velocity

1459
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:29,770
happens to be the primary often gives

1460
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:33,460
the prime the situation after the collision occurs

1461
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:36,640
so now i can apply for the first time the conservation

1462
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:38,110
of momentum

1463
01:32:38,130 --> 01:32:42,530
the momentum before must be the same as the momentum afterwards because there no

1464
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:44,520
external forces on the system

1465
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:48,760
when they collide you better believe it that their internal forces us to believe that

1466
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,020
there is good

1467
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:53,940
and it goes on in a field of forces both of them the momentum of

1468
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:58,590
each one individually is changing but not the momentum of the system as a whole

1469
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,130
so this equals

1470
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:01,110
and one

1471
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,900
plus and two

1472
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,380
the prime

1473
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,250
so if you put in some numbers

1474
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:10,600
suppose and what

1475
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:12,860
equals one kilogram

1476
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:14,290
and the one

1477
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:17,220
five meters per second

1478
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:20,360
let m two be two kilograms

1479
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,150
and that's the to be

1480
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:25,030
meters per second

1481
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:29,260
and you see since both in the same direction momentum here is five

1482
01:33:29,290 --> 01:33:30,790
six is eleven

1483
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:33,140
so this is eleven

1484
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:35,860
and this is one cluster with three

1485
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:40,800
so that's three times the one prime so v one prime

1486
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:45,000
it's eleven thirty meters per second sort of conservation of momentum

1487
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:47,360
tells you what the speed is after

1488
01:33:50,150 --> 01:33:54,700
when we deal with collisions the velocities of the object before the collision are on

1489
01:33:55,950 --> 01:33:57,740
you see here one

1490
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:59,880
you see here the two

1491
01:33:59,890 --> 01:34:02,480
the velocities after the collisions

1492
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:04,660
by convention are primed

1493
01:34:04,670 --> 01:34:05,930
you see here

1494
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:07,630
the prime

1495
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:10,270
now if after the collision

1496
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:12,010
object one object to

1497
01:34:12,150 --> 01:34:13,600
the different velocity

1498
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:15,730
we will call it few one prime

1499
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:17,130
and he two prime

1500
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:18,740
now in this case

1501
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:21,160
we're dealing with an inelastic collision

1502
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:24,650
so m one and m two are stuck together they are merged so it is

1503
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:28,170
to just call it the prime

1504
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:31,540
you could have called it three one prime because we want prime is the same

1505
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:34,720
as the two prime is the same as the prime

1506
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:37,400
and during the next four minutes you'll see

1507
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:41,100
that a few times do i call it the one prime i wish i really

1508
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:46,430
had it would be better if i had just used the prime that is unique

1509
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:49,140
and sufficient

1510
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:52,120
now to a certain amount of

1511
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,890
kinetic energy before the collision

1512
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:59,930
and of course we can all calculate the kinetic energy

1513
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:01,890
before the collision

1514
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:05,400
that is one half and one v one squared plus one half and two v

1515
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,080
two square

1516
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:08,430
one half

1517
01:35:08,490 --> 01:35:09,730
and one of

1518
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:11,230
one square

1519
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,260
one have

1520
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:14,540
and two v two square

1521
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:15,770
which is it

1522
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:17,520
you can do that as well as i can

1523
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:18,760
if you have to

1524
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:21,150
you'll find twenty one

1525
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:22,550
o point five

1526
01:35:22,690 --> 01:35:26,510
trail to taking the number

1527
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,790
now i want to hear from you

1528
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:31,050
what do you think

1529
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:35,790
the situation is worse economic energy after the collision

1530
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,130
don't look at the numbers

1531
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:42,230
just use your intuition may be wrong that's okay my intuition is often wrong

1532
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:45,940
so it was a certain amount of kinetic energy we had this condition

1533
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:48,990
and i want you to tell me what you think that the kinetic energy has

1534
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:51,190
perhaps increase or decrease

1535
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:52,470
or maybe

1536
01:35:52,510 --> 01:35:54,780
the kinetic energy hasn't changed

1537
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:58,810
o things the kinetic energy has not changed

1538
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:02,120
good for you i see some parents even

1539
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:05,690
things are getting energy has decreased

1540
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:07,150
even better for you

1541
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:10,720
it is a professor of physics there can go wrong there

1542
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:14,260
and the things are getting energy has increased

1543
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:17,680
no one things that they a amazing

1544
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:19,480
let's take a look

1545
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,050
kinetic energy

1546
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:24,910
the collision

1547
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,730
that would be one half

1548
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:29,310
and one class and two

1549
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,780
the prime squared

1550
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:33,230
what we agree

1551
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:34,660
the right this

1552
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,130
different location

1553
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:40,650
this was the twenty one and a half

1554
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:45,190
well you can do this as well as i can we know be one prime

1555
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:46,800
minister's eleven third

1556
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:47,900
you will find

1557
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,790
so what would be a reasonable

1558
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:52,640
the fourth

1559
01:36:52,650 --> 01:36:53,970
well let me

1560
01:36:53,980 --> 01:36:56,140
what the right thing

1561
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:57,630
it means that

1562
01:36:57,640 --> 01:37:00,020
every factor and s

1563
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:17,510
one of my

1564
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:36,940
but i want see what

1565
01:37:37,110 --> 01:37:41,040
well the

1566
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:43,000
the last four

1567
01:37:44,890 --> 01:37:47,920
are you

1568
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:49,270
all right

1569
01:37:49,390 --> 01:37:51,810
we're not three

1570
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:55,010
the line

1571
01:37:55,050 --> 01:38:02,390
the white

1572
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:09,260
it's not like four

1573
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:15,010
the article right

1574
01:38:25,180 --> 01:38:27,490
you can tell me about here

1575
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:33,100
in the last quarter the year in the war that are not

1576
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:42,360
well i mean

1577
01:38:44,830 --> 01:38:47,530
forty five three

1578
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:48,870
like four

1579
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:57,430
the fact that even more

1580
01:38:57,450 --> 01:39:00,640
you tell have the

1581
01:39:00,650 --> 01:39:02,240
in fall

1582
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:04,910
the whiteboard one more

1583
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:10,610
for sure

1584
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:14,340
what was

1585
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:19,690
what about the like bull

1586
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:31,120
for me

1587
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:41,640
one the other

1588
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:03,100
but also

1589
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:07,340
why not

1590
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:22,350
in the plane

1591
01:40:24,450 --> 01:40:31,820
really all

1592
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:34,630
a line the are

1593
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:36,940
or the

1594
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:40,100
now we

1595
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:42,390
the line of the article

1596
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:47,300
orthogonal to the whole planet

1597
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:49,420
right now

1598
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:52,890
the line they are orthogonal to

1599
01:40:52,910 --> 01:40:53,640
there are

1600
01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:04,080
when the line the origin orthogonal to a different the are well

1601
01:41:04,130 --> 01:41:06,250
that is the case that we all

1602
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:08,420
i have a clear picture they

1603
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,030
the two lines that need not be free

1604
01:41:11,030 --> 01:41:12,880
they have only

1605
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,530
so that for the

1606
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:17,930
like the simple case i'm talking about the one

1607
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:21,180
the other place they only needed there

1608
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:22,920
and there are

1609
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:27,960
so we now know what i mean

1610
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:29,440
four two

1611
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:32,890
so they be orthogonal and now i want

1612
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:36,410
that is true for the role played

1613
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:38,620
OK that

1614
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:45,050
o right

1615
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:51,790
o point o

1616
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:59,950
now how i know that

1617
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:02,150
but you might be right

1618
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:03,860
that means that the

1619
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:05,330
the piece

1620
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:07,970
this the right thing

1621
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:09,980
because cutting the whole

1622
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,760
two perpendicular

1623
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:21,060
OK so what

1624
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:23,730
well when i got

1625
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:25,400
i work with

1626
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:28,640
all i know is that all

1627
01:42:28,690 --> 01:42:31,810
no factor for all

1628
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:34,580
a equal the

1629
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:37,970
well the the the the and

1630
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:41,390
x all

1631
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:44,730
then they are

1632
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,140
so why

1633
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:47,590
there are

1634
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:50,680
the right

1635
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:55,780
if i write down a which is all i know about

1636
01:42:57,710 --> 01:42:59,190
i just wanted to see

1637
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:00,640
that telling me

1638
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:04,460
the just that great right there telling me

1639
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:07,100
the role of the right

1640
01:43:07,110 --> 01:43:09,200
there is a row of

1641
01:43:14,710 --> 01:43:17,350
grow r

1642
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:21,960
and multiply

1643
01:43:21,970 --> 01:43:23,910
and produce

1644
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:30,680
right now

1645
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:39,480
it perpendicular to

1646
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:44,730
and if see want

1647
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:47,110
because the way telling you

1648
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:50,200
that role was a

1649
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:58,140
multiply that are not quite right or one of the product with reduced the

1650
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:00,860
so is orthogonal

1651
01:44:01,070 --> 01:44:03,380
the first row

1652
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:04,960
and the

1653
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:08,080
two of the

1654
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:10,870
o and by doing that

1655
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:18,900
not all the around

1656
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:22,110
so we

1657
01:44:22,110 --> 01:44:26,900
and this is actually quite i mean sometimes is one of the reasons

1658
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:28,630
but people introduce

1659
01:44:28,650 --> 01:44:31,980
exponential family distributions

1660
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:35,190
namely maximum entropy estimation

1661
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:40,480
i mean really really loosely speaking entropy is based on the number of bits that

1662
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,590
you need to encode random variable

1663
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:45,170
and while we can define it as

1664
01:44:45,190 --> 01:44:49,610
the expected value of the negative log p of x

1665
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:54,840
and we just zero of serie c

1666
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:58,690
so it turns out

1667
01:44:58,690 --> 01:45:01,250
but the density p of x

1668
01:45:01,310 --> 01:45:05,900
which satisfies the condition that the expected value for fixes critical in nature

1669
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:09,060
with maximum entropy

1670
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:11,440
it is of this form

1671
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:14,570
d theta

1672
01:45:14,590 --> 01:45:15,750
g of data

1673
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:18,980
because it

1674
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:27,400
who has seen this fact before

1675
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:30,440
four five people

1676
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:39,940
well who want to see the proof

1677
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:43,230
OK so basically in the break

1678
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:47,480
five minutes break when other people can go to the bathroom you'll get to see

1679
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:50,690
the proof

1680
01:45:55,690 --> 01:45:57,610
one of the crawler is is

1681
01:45:58,480 --> 01:45:59,830
maximum entropy

1682
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:02,790
distribution with the given variance

1683
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:04,630
the gas distribution

1684
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:07,860
because the

1685
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:24,980
so i will get a distribution which looks like mix

1686
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:29,520
is proportional to the equals

1687
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:31,110
he to that

1688
01:46:31,170 --> 01:46:32,830
some parameters

1689
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:34,380
the ten times

1690
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,040
x squared

1691
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:38,940
minus g

1692
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:42,860
alpha theta

1693
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:48,770
because this is the same guy here

1694
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:52,060
now i have a normal distribution

1695
01:46:52,090 --> 01:46:54,590
they want to play around with the mean two

1696
01:46:54,590 --> 01:46:58,210
i might want to say something like the expected value of x

1697
01:46:58,230 --> 01:47:01,860
it's critical then say maybe two

1698
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:05,500
so i would get theta two x squared

1699
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:08,980
theta one convex

1700
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,520
and off we go again

1701
01:47:15,730 --> 01:47:18,480
if i just want to play around with the mean

1702
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:25,650
just required the expected value x is critical density two

1703
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:27,790
i would get if you fix

1704
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:30,310
being over

1705
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:36,360
theta time six months g data

1706
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:41,810
i could then say well you that should be the case

1707
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:46,020
to be

1708
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:49,830
in the domain of integers

1709
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:53,270
well then i will get the different function g but that's the only thing i

1710
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:56,790
would change

1711
01:47:56,810 --> 01:47:59,920
so a fairly powerful mechanism

1712
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,040
how to turn conditions

1713
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:05,230
on expectations of random variables

1714
01:48:05,290 --> 01:48:10,980
into distribution

1715
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,630
entire conferences

1716
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:14,980
on well one how to do this efficiently

1717
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,920
conference called it

1718
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:20,360
now in fact

1719
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:22,170
as it will turn out

1720
01:48:22,210 --> 01:48:25,810
this is not topic of this talk but it's quite

1721
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:28,830
an amazing thing that

1722
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:33,230
you yes not tonight

1723
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:39,230
you don't just know

1724
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:43,900
exactly that the expected value of some of the books

1725
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:48,590
so i mean

1726
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:49,960
but it just

1727
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:52,840
minus mu but this norm

1728
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:57,380
is less equal than some epsilon

1729
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:02,000
and you want to find the maximum entropy distribution of that

1730
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,190
you will get an estimate

1731
01:49:05,230 --> 01:49:08,590
which will not be a maximum likelihood estimate

1732
01:49:08,710 --> 01:49:11,330
but a maximum posterior system

1733
01:49:11,410 --> 01:49:15,630
then you get bayesian estimation of this

1734
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:20,520
that's all i wanted to say about that specific thing

1735
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:26,750
it's actually put to practical use

1736
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:29,460
i mean these are all really nice things to know

1737
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:32,290
in order to know that well you the world is all sane and all the

1738
01:49:32,290 --> 01:49:36,230
estimation algorithms lead to something quite similar

1739
01:49:38,670 --> 01:49:41,090
now let's actually put to practical use

1740
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:45,400
let's say we observe some topics one three exam

1741
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:49,940
which are drawn from some distribution pfx parameters by theta

1742
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:53,880
well i could going compute the likelihood

1743
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,290
p of x

1744
01:49:55,310 --> 01:49:57,480
practice y theta

1745
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:58,440
which is

1746
01:49:58,670 --> 01:50:02,040
big product over all my observations off

1747
01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:05,060
individual probabilities

1748
01:50:07,610 --> 01:50:08,360
this is the

1749
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:13,840
always the case if all the excise are drawn independently

1750
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:17,090
if they were to depend on each other i couldn't just write the

1751
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:21,210
joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities by

1752
01:50:21,210 --> 01:50:23,860
since there all drawn independently is i assume

1753
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:25,310
that's the case

1754
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:28,900
we know

1755
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:34,460
well this is an exponential second push this product inside

1756
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,630
and we'll take it is

1757
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:37,690
each other

1758
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:40,590
and then the sum of the form of

1759
01:50:40,610 --> 01:50:43,150
in here

1760
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:47,840
and they get in times your data

1761
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:55,090
further in terms of this expression just in time shifted to

1762
01:50:58,190 --> 01:50:59,270
let me

1763
01:50:59,290 --> 01:51:02,670
put those intermediate calculations upon the watchword

1764
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:13,150
p of x

1765
01:51:13,170 --> 01:51:15,380
parameterized theta

1766
01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:21,270
is if i push this inside is each other

1767
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:26,020
some i going from one to n

1768
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:28,770
following a fixed online

1769
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,130
inner product with theta

1770
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:36,190
in times g of data

1771
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:44,090
a very happy with this equation

1772
01:51:44,090 --> 01:51:47,130
was unhappy

1773
01:51:47,150 --> 01:51:49,130
now it could

1774
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:51,230
if i want to

1775
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:53,420
i find that theta

1776
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:57,360
which is the most likely theta explaining the doctor

1777
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,000
explaining x

1778
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:00,310
well i would go

1779
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:01,980
and compute

1780
01:52:04,670 --> 01:52:06,750
all data

1781
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:09,040
p of data

1782
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:13,650
p fix

1783
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:15,860
the transport sector

1784
01:52:15,860 --> 01:52:17,980
which is of course the same thing

1785
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,170
the argmin

1786
01:52:21,170 --> 01:52:23,420
that may help us

1787
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:24,600
for example

1788
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:29,980
with an inductive argument in order to obtain generalizations for an arbitrary business

1789
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:33,710
so why don't we started doing

1790
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:36,530
that's exactly what we are going to do

1791
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:40,020
so the question is how does bayesian africa

1792
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:42,140
it's a very simple reason

1793
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:44,270
it's got only three no

1794
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:46,790
and i want to ask the following question

1795
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:51,290
he's is a independent of b

1796
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:53,670
that's the way

1797
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:56,730
so this is just notation here for independent

1798
01:52:56,730 --> 01:53:00,410
i just want to ask where a is in the independent

1799
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:04,280
you know to check that i check if this is true

1800
01:53:06,910 --> 01:53:09,720
so let's look at

1801
01:53:09,750 --> 01:53:11,810
what's p of a and b

1802
01:53:11,830 --> 01:53:18,040
well i guess you i have the joint probability distribution for the model

1803
01:53:18,090 --> 01:53:23,360
so p of a b by marginalisation which is the creation cool

1804
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:27,750
observation and they can give examples of the two possible the quite

1805
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:32,410
by marginalisation we are something out on all

1806
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:33,980
instances of p

1807
01:53:34,110 --> 01:53:35,500
of situations c

1808
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:40,250
of p of baby p of the these are some of our CEO

1809
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,940
but p of a

1810
01:53:42,970 --> 01:53:46,290
is given by the factorisation of these bayesian network

1811
01:53:46,350 --> 01:53:50,190
which is the parent the children given the parent

1812
01:53:50,210 --> 01:53:52,750
the product over all

1813
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:57,770
so what's of ABC's p of a

1814
01:53:57,850 --> 01:54:01,900
times p of the given a times p of the given

1815
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:10,210
and i'm something on c

1816
01:54:10,270 --> 01:54:15,660
immediately a observed that there is one of these factors that does not belong on

1817
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:18,400
the doesn't depend

1818
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:22,560
his first factor does not depend on the exact constant factor for c

1819
01:54:22,580 --> 01:54:24,610
so what can we do remember

1820
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,540
the distributive law

1821
01:54:26,590 --> 01:54:29,230
let's just use the distributive law

1822
01:54:29,290 --> 01:54:32,810
in pull the spectrum of the sun

1823
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:36,340
that's exactly what we get here

1824
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:38,500
and now we only sample c

1825
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:40,790
these quantities

1826
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:43,850
which is basically p of the evening

1827
01:54:43,930 --> 01:54:45,540
that's our conclusions

1828
01:54:45,550 --> 01:54:50,110
these quantities here p of ten p of the given that in general is different

1829
01:54:50,110 --> 01:54:53,310
from this one

1830
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:57,430
he of be given they had to be

1831
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:58,990
i had to be itself

1832
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:01,850
i mean basically

1833
01:55:01,890 --> 01:55:04,170
these on hold in general

1834
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:06,230
in this graph

1835
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:13,290
and that makes a lot of sense why well we have to change here right

1836
01:55:13,290 --> 01:55:16,740
we have to abide these has some dependency on the one

1837
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:20,100
and some dependency on this one

1838
01:55:20,150 --> 01:55:24,430
so it is natural to expect that you will have some dependency on this one

1839
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:30,600
so these two violin not independent in general

1840
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:32,990
now the question

1841
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:39,750
let's assume is slightly different although well let's assume that you actually observed these viability

1842
01:55:39,770 --> 01:55:44,810
and let's ask whether these two are now independent

1843
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:47,990
so now we are looking for conditional independence

1844
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:53,900
you want to ask the following question is a the condition dependency

1845
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:55,930
that's the question

1846
01:55:57,660 --> 01:56:01,330
are you the conditional independence

1847
01:56:01,370 --> 01:56:08,900
well what we do

1848
01:56:08,910 --> 01:56:12,970
i can

1849
01:56:14,590 --> 01:56:16,130
where the

1850
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:19,400
is the condition that be given scene by the

1851
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:21,700
by the fact position of that

1852
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:24,680
and they also have these

1853
01:56:24,690 --> 01:56:26,360
very factorizations

1854
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:31,700
let's first check whether this factorizations

1855
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:35,920
it will be applied to conditional independence

1856
01:56:36,470 --> 01:56:37,520
these graphs

1857
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:40,380
so the station to this point

1858
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:43,360
what you want if you're out is the full

1859
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:46,140
these graph has a given factorizations

1860
01:56:49,590 --> 01:56:51,430
it also

1861
01:56:51,490 --> 01:56:54,870
implies conditional independence and conditional independence

1862
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:58,020
so what will see that these factorizations here

1863
01:56:58,060 --> 01:56:59,460
i will imply

1864
01:56:59,490 --> 01:57:02,260
the article conditional independence there

1865
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:05,460
particular condition the best for the graph

1866
01:57:05,470 --> 01:57:06,690
and now

1867
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:09,300
that's exactly what we're going to see that happen

1868
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:13,030
if we factorized these models

1869
01:57:13,090 --> 01:57:15,590
will think he of a

1870
01:57:15,610 --> 01:57:19,790
and if you give them a times appealed the

1871
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:22,290
now the question is

1872
01:57:22,340 --> 01:57:24,150
does it imply

1873
01:57:24,190 --> 01:57:26,220
this independent

1874
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:30,530
in fact position implies this

1875
01:57:30,530 --> 01:57:36,400
so let's start with some definitions

1876
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:39,380
these definitions are the

1877
01:57:39,390 --> 01:57:45,650
but in the sense that the dynamic system theory is well developed a theory which

1878
01:57:45,650 --> 01:57:54,120
was studied very well after the second world war around the second world war we

1879
01:57:54,120 --> 01:58:02,450
have a huge number of results concerning me meaning being systems but also non-linear systems

1880
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:10,360
and also very formal definition of what the system uses a sort of axiomatic definition

1881
01:58:10,370 --> 01:58:15,820
for a one hour and a half talk i decided to move towards more qualitative

1882
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:20,960
definition of the system to just perspective of

1883
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:26,190
this theory approach to the study of

1884
01:58:26,210 --> 01:58:28,590
systems some changes over time

1885
01:58:28,630 --> 01:58:34,370
so this is the nature of a system is the physical and

1886
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:43,250
but not necessarily physically listening which can be manipulated with actions which are called inputs

1887
01:58:43,340 --> 01:58:48,530
and that is the consequence of the action measurable reaction called output

1888
01:58:48,570 --> 01:58:54,150
this is in general definition of the system which is used in dynamical system theory

1889
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:58,830
what is new addition with respect to this definition

1890
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:05,230
this is the definition of dynamical systems dynamical system is a system which changes over

1891
01:59:05,230 --> 01:59:10,840
time and what very important is that the output does not only depend on the

1892
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:15,860
inputs but also depends on the current state of this is

1893
01:59:15,870 --> 01:59:18,660
so on the system history

1894
01:59:18,670 --> 01:59:23,660
this means that the system is in memory actually this makes difference with respect to

1895
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:28,730
the standard systems so i mean this is a system which is not dynamic system

1896
01:59:28,740 --> 01:59:34,070
in which the output is just the function the died function of the input so

1897
01:59:34,530 --> 01:59:37,480
if i take a friend and you give me

1898
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:40,090
give me another key

1899
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:47,290
so this is not really dynamic this time inside just cause effect relationship then it's

1900
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:54,270
dynamic system friends remember that very strong and can business so

1901
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:59,920
he avoid to to keep min thirty two you can sell

1902
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,690
here's a memory actually

1903
02:00:02,700 --> 02:00:08,210
and this is the notion of the dynamic systems are dynamic system is in

1904
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:11,860
being more serious disease

1905
02:00:11,870 --> 02:00:16,510
a simple example of what is the dynamical system

1906
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:24,020
so the example the following we have simple with we just lens in

1907
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:25,340
one switch

1908
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:31,670
so this which is a actually can be on on or off zero or one

1909
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:40,210
the output can is a bit but the basis of three different the configuration we

1910
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:41,440
have two lanes

1911
02:00:41,490 --> 02:00:44,040
so i'll put one is the one on

1912
02:00:44,070 --> 02:00:45,290
the output two

1913
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:50,950
is that two and the output three is off so both of them all

1914
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:54,290
it's not possible to have both of them on OK

1915
02:00:55,390 --> 02:01:00,600
the overall system is configured in order to to have four states and we can

1916
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:02,200
commence the

1917
02:01:02,270 --> 02:01:06,640
how the system is working taking a look this diagram

1918
02:01:06,660 --> 02:01:12,500
so let's start from state the number one and also this diagram

1919
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:16,190
this one just minutes space and improved

1920
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:18,580
one state and out

1921
02:01:18,600 --> 02:01:23,830
it's probably more simple start from these examples from this diagram here

1922
02:01:23,850 --> 02:01:28,050
so states x one means that we have also

1923
02:01:28,110 --> 02:01:30,750
that we have lamp on

1924
02:01:30,770 --> 02:01:33,970
i loved one or state x two

1925
02:01:34,010 --> 02:01:35,390
it is often

1926
02:01:35,410 --> 02:01:36,530
they three

1927
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:38,170
is land so on

1928
02:01:38,230 --> 02:01:40,940
think it's for ease of

1929
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,550
but this is the worse on in this way

1930
02:01:43,570 --> 02:01:46,350
if you are if we are in state x one

1931
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:48,980
which is number one on

1932
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:53,020
then we apply the switch

1933
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:58,480
so we switch it on basically we have these input we move from x one

1934
02:01:58,480 --> 02:01:59,630
to x two

1935
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:02,130
x two means the land is often

1936
02:02:02,910 --> 02:02:04,210
then from x two

1937
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:05,600
we can only apply

1938
02:02:05,610 --> 02:02:09,650
input u one which is switch off the

1939
02:02:09,670 --> 02:02:11,160
and we move from

1940
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:15,570
the state x two which is often state three

1941
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:20,380
which is the last two is on so it's like a is is something which

1942
02:02:20,380 --> 02:02:23,530
is very similar to our theoretical and memory on

1943
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:30,880
the mobile phone or any device which remembers what the current state action so

1944
02:02:30,890 --> 02:02:36,620
i contains click on and off on this week and they change the configuration of

1945
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:42,330
the land first two of then limk one then off the land to then often

1946
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:44,660
so this is a dynamical system

1947
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:50,590
because the output does not only depend on the input but depends also on the

1948
02:02:50,590 --> 02:02:52,490
past history

1949
02:02:58,420 --> 02:02:59,370
the game

1950
02:02:59,410 --> 02:03:04,910
another definition of the dynamical system is that it the dynamical system is a process

1951
02:03:04,910 --> 02:03:07,910
in which function changes over time

1952
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:09,620
according to a rule

1953
02:03:09,630 --> 02:03:14,280
it is defined in terms of the phi hill current value and the current so

1954
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:16,950
what's important of the example
