1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
the start with its profits

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,820
he is

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,670
in both

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,440
yes this universal

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,380
you are in

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,290
both extremes knowledge and

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,630
the opposite lane

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,210
morning today

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,770
problem in the sense that would be a massive

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,880
in order to come to both human and

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,420
the things going on here

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:42,800
we not only economic changes this simplification currently about

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,940
one of the

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,480
that means that we

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,880
human the one to of my face

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
i know

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:04,190
one experiment i know this is what you're not going to be

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,250
OK do what

19
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,840
the in connecting

20
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,960
you know

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,770
it's pretty low

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,650
he worked so that

23
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,520
the computer can cope

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,840
very well in the united states right up until

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,880
you you're on humans but what

26
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,860
you can't you don't even need to provide

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,900
think of of course

28
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,320
you can directly by

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,380
moving because you know you connect your computer computer

30
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,770
and like you know

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,820
i think it is something frightens you almost

32
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,320
five one

33
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,110
first of all

34
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,130
out of goal

35
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,210
in i

36
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,670
i don't so

37
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,980
i mean that the goal

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,400
united states

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,090
who in the greek letters

40
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,710
this is

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,840
but it is you're talking about you know about it

42
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,020
in now is now

43
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,770
but they actually you know we want to make

44
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,520
your brain images

45
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,900
electromagnetic which can be very complex

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,070
what we

47
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,690
we are

48
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,730
it's easy to reproduce those ways

49
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,460
we want you to use

50
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,380
you like the one

51
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,650
what we

52
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,170
you read about it and not to mention about these topics all of them

53
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,320
control manipulation

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,820
your properties that is changing general but general case

55
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,800
for the goal

56
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,650
so what are you

57
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,380
in the university

58
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,460
it's the connecting thing

59
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,170
keep your fuzzy so

60
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:33,790
three human capability into a remote control

61
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,340
you can make

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,190
in the leader

63
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,960
that that's

64
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,360
and the only icon guys in the can media you want to know

65
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,540
the fact that it of course you

66
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,980
but we want to be there

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,090
they get me this probably the

68
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,820
the question is the following

69
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,790
when you may be like control like

70
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,840
i don't hear you are

71
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,400
the guy

72
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,590
you and i don't know about you

73
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,290
the cars

74
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,420
how do i experience

75
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,860
it's like you know michael kind of compromise or we don't know

76
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,690
they claim that they did experiments showed

77
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,130
for this action

78
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:37,290
o thing going around freely but i i'm not know

79
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,520
it looks pretty so

80
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,520
what i'm saying we don't want to go one it's not i i have

81
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,440
the mother

82
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:58,300
what i'm saying is that featured ongoing now my which

83
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,960
in way the

84
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,110
she wanted to be human basic idea of human is based on the fact that

85
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,670
i think i hear of their

86
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,360
if you get four

87
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,650
we can use

88
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,900
and so on in which the band

89
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,110
we people avoid

90
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,670
both extremes of the mind

91
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:30,770
you get this notion of one four claims we have to be it just download

92
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,560
from one to another

93
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,270
on the other hand you this report that not in the remaining

94
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,020
now there are

95
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,060
we don't know

96
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:48,000
we all know that human nature is not the case and she

97
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:58,400
so we need more than ever now just coming from the here we need for

98
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,150
here we

99
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,860
here we need not

100
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,670
in what sense

101
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,290
it's fun

102
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,070
and to do that

103
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,480
today's societies

104
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,750
so size of

105
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,170
not much

106
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,570
knowledge matters to

107
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,730
it is that

108
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,980
i would say is

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,570
not that

110
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,250
we don't know enough you know about the

111
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,790
we have no

112
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,090
more and more in the sense that

113
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,640
depressingly well

114
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:40,660
but it's just a perceptron and it doesn't have multiple layers of representation. it has to

115
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,420
be the case for big complicated problems, multiple layers of representation are going to be a win

116
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,250
i'll try to convince you more of that later

117
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,230
what's wrong with back propagation? the reason it can't compete with support vector machines on many of the tasks

118
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:00,790
it was tried at, or doesn't do any better at least, is it requires labeled training data

119
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
and the big labeled sets is tough

120
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,780
the learning time doesn't scale well--it's slow in deep networks

121
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,300
and deep networks often gets stuck in poor local optima

122
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,310
they're much better than random, but we now know that: because we've got better ways of

123
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,020
training them of, deep networks can find much better optima than you find by just doing back propagation

124
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,780
from the labels

125
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,590
so the idea for overcoming those limitations

126
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,480
within the framework of neural nets in a very loose sense, is we're going to

127
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,240
try and keep the efficiency of doing learning by doing gradient descent some cost function

128
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,290
but it's going to be a different cost function, at least to begin with. instead of trying

129
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,920
to model the probability of the label given the image

130
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,330
just try to model the probability of an image

131
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,530
is going to build generative model of images

132
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,140
and once we've built this model, maybe it'll be able to say that's a likely image and this is an unlikely

133
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,650
the main purpose of building this generative model is going to be so we have

134
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,310
these features that we can use for something else later

135
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,600
but there are also other reasons you might want to build it like if you're monitoring a nuclear

136
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,750
power station you might like to just know that it's in some improbable state and then

137
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,890
you run

138
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,730
throughout the 1990's, starting the 80's, throughout the 1990's, people developed an area called

139
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,020
graphical models

140
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,200
i'm gonna use the term belief net

141
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,650
to mean essentially a directed

142
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,960
graphical model

143
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,340
which is acyclic

144
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,000
this term is not really very well defined

145
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,510
so here's an example of a graphical model. these are

146
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,450
variables that can have values

147
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,380
and these are the observed variables

148
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:51,670
and you assume that when you make an observation, it was generated by some model like this

149
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,710
so there's three problems

150
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,910
one is

151
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,700
and what's the structure of the model

152
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,260
i'll basically ignore that problem in this tutorial

153
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,480
a second

154
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,450
problem is

155
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,910
if you think you know the structure of the model, that is how many units

156
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:12,990
in each layer and how many layers, can you infer what state of these hidden variables probably

157
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,570
caused is visible effects

158
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,940
it's going to be a probabilistic model and therefore you're not going to be able

159
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,230
to infer these things for sure

160
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,690
indeed there may be many many different combinations of states you might have led to

161
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,850
the at least we would like to be able to pick some likely combination

162
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,490
or maybe pick some hidden configuration with a probability that's proportional to how likely it was to have cause

163
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,480
given the current model

164
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,710
that's the inference problem

165
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,340
and that's assuming that you know all the parameters that define how the states of

166
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,110
these two variables determine the state of this variable

167
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,270
what these arrows mean is that these guys determine the state of that guy

168
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,890
the learning problem is: can we now adjust all these parameters

169
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,650
so as to make this model more likely to generate the observed data?

170
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,890
so learning is going to consist, if you knew the structure, of setting these parameters to

171
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,320
make the model more likely to generate the observed data

172
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:09,180
and then perceptions is gonna consist of seeing some data and trying to figure out how

173
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,000
it was probably caused by this model and then saying the states of these guys are my

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
guess about the underlying causes

175
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,540
and then maybe if this one says

176
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,170
tiger and this one says running towards me then i do something

177
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,050
i'm going to use nets composed of stochastic binary variables for most of this tutorial

178
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:34,530
but i will talk about other kinds of variable later

179
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,740
so they're stochastic binary variables

180
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,040
bernoulli variables they get some input

181
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,700
which in the generative model come from above

182
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,640
it's the sum of the

183
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,850
states of the units in the layer above

184
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,170
times the weights on the connections plus some bias term

185
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,000
and they give some output

186
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,700
and the output is gonna be a 1 or a 0. they're gonna be stochastic units

187
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,460
the probability that it's a 1 is going to follow this logistic curve

188
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,440
so if the total input is 0, it's gotta,

189
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,500
it flips a coin essentially. if the total input is big and positive, it's nearly always on

190
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,300
and vice versa so this is just the standard logistic function that's also used in

191
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,170
some backpropagation networks

192
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,290
so now when we try and learn one of these nets

193
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,880
one thing that is easy to do with one of these nets is if i

194
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,350
tell you

195
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,580
the parameters on these connections the weights on all these connections

196
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,810
and i ask you show me the kinds of things the network believes in, the

197
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,630
kinds of examples it wants to generate

198
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,390
well, the parameters are gonna include biases for the top level units

199
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,400
so using the biases for the top level units i decide whether they should be

200
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,140
on or off

201
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,740
then knowing the states of these two units

202
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,200
i decide whether this one should be on or off, this one may also have bias

203
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,280
and in parallel i can decide whether these ones should be on or off

204
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,680
and then knowing the states of all these three, i can decide in parallel whether these ones should

205
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,710
be on or off so i can generate

206
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,610
a binary observed vector

207
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,300
and i can do it again and i'll typically get a different answer because it's stochastic

208
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,340
so it's very easy by doing what's called an ancestral pass just bandpass this

209
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,900
to produce samples of what the model believes in.

210
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,680
that's easy.

211
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,430
it's much harder to infer, given a sample that you assume is produced by the model,

212
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,960
how the model produced it

213
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,930
it's hard to even get

214
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,090
any good guess about that

215
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,860
that's because of a phenomenon called explaining away

216
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,780
so it's going to be very hard to learn deep nets like this because you can't even

217
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,540
to the do the inference, and to do the learning you need to be able to do

218
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,700
the inference

219
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,080
at least approximately

220
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,700
but for now let's suspend

221
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,810
disbelief and suppose that we could do the inference so suppose that

222
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,140
we could infer

223
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,310
some probable state of the hidden variables

224
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,100
we could

225
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,640
pick a state in proportion to the probability that that was the state that generated the

226
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,260
observed vector

227
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,380
then the learning is very easy in a sigmoid belief net

228
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,100
so let's suppose we want to learn the weights coming into this unit i

229
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,480
these are the units in the layer above

230
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,400
let's suppose this is some hidden unit

231
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,140
what we need to do

232
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,450
take a sample from the posterior which gives you a binary state for each of

233
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,090
these guys

234
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,900
and say: what we want to do is maximize

235
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,740
the probability

236
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,710
the observed binary state would have been produced by

237
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,750
the states that were observed up here

238
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,060
so the probability of producing the observed binary state

239
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,640
i'll call p i

240
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,900
that's the probability this is one given the states of these guys

241
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,670
which is just, ignoring biases, is the logistic of

242
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,250
the sum of these weights times these states

243
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,950
so that's the probability the units up here would have turned it on

244
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:51,700
p i

245
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,830
and we have some actual state for it, s i

246
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,780
and so

247
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,790
the maximum likelihood learning rule turns out to be: change the weight in proportion to

248
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,080
that's a learning rate

249
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,570
the difference between the state and the probability it's turned on, multiplied by the

250
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:12,040
i call this the presynaptic state the state of the unit that's driving it here

251
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,660
and the reason learning is going to happen is because the state of this guy when

252
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,180
you did inference

253
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,490
doesn't just depend on what these are up to, it depends on what's going on down here

254
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,730
so typically it won't be the same as the p i

255
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,570
and this will make the p i more like the s i

256
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,840
so the learning is nice and easy

257
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,940
it's the inference that's hard

258
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,190
and i want you to have an understanding for why inference is hard because it

259
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,190
turns out getting rid of that problem in the inference is the whole secret to making

260
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,150
these deep belief nets easier to learn.

261
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:48,350
the person next door you like a there's always the right where you thinking bottom-up

262
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:54,370
design you get uncomfortable calling methods that don't exist riots like but that doesn't exist

263
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,890
in like it's cool man right

264
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,750
and then we hold hands and sing kumbaya on everything good because of the and

265
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,280
carol going to know what to do so sometimes you just right methods and they

266
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,290
don't exist and it's fine because you're the one that's going to be writing them

267
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,490
so eventually they will exist right it's not like you're sitting there like the lighting

268
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,790
candles make some magic incantations hoping the go to show that not isabelle you know

269
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,750
it's not very

270
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,960
and you're right i have a friend one actually that would computer science i didn't

271
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,460
bother to tell them that that wasn't sure but if you think about it so

272
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,240
we can be pretty and i was kind of mean but that's all right he

273
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,930
does government now

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,370
we pick up to be present and guess what after we do that we've when

275
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,040
that's done we'll have picked up all the the first from that poll were standing

276
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,100
on and we would have put two next door for every people we picked up

277
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,720
so we're done with this while if we know that something is true is that

278
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,540
there's no more beekeepers on now pile because the first president is no longer true

279
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,170
so i have some pile next to me say on the next corner that has

280
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,830
twice as many people as on and so what i want to do i just

281
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,990
want to move the pile next door

282
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,650
and that's why function you like reckoning that sure why not so what we need

283
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,470
to right now well we need to know

284
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,270
you know how to put to be placed next or so let's go ahead and

285
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,710
write that provide private void

286
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,000
the person next door

287
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,150
right now i'm standing on a particular corner facing east what they want to put

288
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,720
to be put on the space in front of me and come back to where

289
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,420
i am still facing east some left in the same position i was when i

290
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,850
started how do i do that

291
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,710
i move

292
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,640
i need to put to be per so i could put a deeper part the

293
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,710
brain if you really wanted to you could put a formal appearance a you doing

294
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:41,040
something twice can i can i do for do before i called for in cycles

295
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,450
zero i less than two i plus plus probably for sure

296
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,390
but there is not always writing program is gonna put two but the first because

297
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,810
two lines the for loop put it into line still now what do i do

298
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,430
ah yeah rock on i move backward right which allows me to move back one

299
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:01,050
step and keep the same orientation so i end up my post condition is essentially

300
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,400
the same as my precondition except i've moved one b over to the output to

301
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,260
be present in the next spot and move backward you like a i already wrote

302
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,450
that so everything now in terms of instructions the carol understands at this point i

303
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,940
don't need to go any further so know output to represent store so the only

304
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,550
thing left to do in this program is to move the pile next or back

305
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,930
to where i am now

306
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,440
OK so what that means is how do i move that pile back to where

307
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,640
i am

308
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,070
so i'll call this for lack of well i know what the

309
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,440
function name is all oldest or the method name in order to steal it from

310
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,300
here can sometimes you just get tired of typing are right move the pile next

311
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,780
or back well

312
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,740
the place that i call this right i call this up here i'm not actually

313
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,020
on the pile next or what i call around my precondition is i am on

314
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,370
the avenue before the problem facing the pile but i'm not on the pile so

315
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,730
the first thing i need to do in terms of moving the pile next or

316
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,950
back is i need to move over to where the pile so now i'm standing

317
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,400
on a pile of twice as many beekeepers and i want to move all the

318
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,310
beeper back one so

319
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,740
what can i do

320
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,930
i could pick people but there's something i want to do multiple times

321
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,710
i need to have a while loop right and i'm going to do something what

322
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,370
condition i want to test right

323
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,720
in the first president right so as long as the first president there's still more

324
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,710
work for me to do because i there's still more be presented to move back

325
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,880
so what are the first president

326
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,980
what i move one beeper back move

327
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,760
one per back

328
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,910
all right again haven't yet that's fine but when this loop is done what i

329
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,550
know is i've exhausted all the people on this poll because every time i would

330
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,800
be prepared and i picked it up i moved it back one spot and hopefully

331
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,130
that method brought me back should bring me back to the place i'm standing right

332
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,240
now and i just keep doing this until transferred all the peepers so after transferred

333
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,240
all the people what do i need to do to satisfy my post condition which

334
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,990
i want to go back to the place i just transferred all the beavers

335
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,440
i need to move

336
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:03,990
backwards because all the beavers were transferred one avenue back so i just moved backward

337
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,120
to go back one now

338
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,510
i'm almost done i'm almost feeling good but not quite i need to do the

339
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:17,000
move one p per back at this point have gone to such a simple level

340
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,630
that maybe i could just do this stuff i'm standing on a pile of the

341
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,620
first facing east how do i move one back behind me

342
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:28,460
put it down and come back to the spot on that

343
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,720
well first let me take a deeper right because i need to actually move the

344
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,190
b breaker turnaround first that's perfectly fine as multiple ways i can do things from

345
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,150
and pick the beeper first and what i do

346
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,920
rather than turning around let me just use move backward i'll take me back one

347
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,440
then i

348
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,800
but the person

349
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,410
and i

350
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,070
move to move back to this spot that i

351
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,970
right now all in terms of things that what i refer to as primitives right

352
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,980
or instructions that previously defined and there's nothing more for me to define because every

353
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,180
time i find some new method hey i'm just going to call that i when

354
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,310
i wrote it and i just kept doing that over and over until written everything

355
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,270
i needed to do

356
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:20,430
on move pile next or back now because move one beeper back

357
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,610
i pick up b prime move backward i drop it off and i move forward

358
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,850
time on the pile that has all the beavers

359
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,890
and that's what i did up here right after i double papa then i move

360
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,300
backwards so it's a that's a good point which always want to remember what other

361
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,700
things are going to happen after you execute all that

362
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,230
OK so now the question comes up

363
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,980
that's a good question the only problem arguing that carol start with an infinite number

364
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,690
of the prisoners back right so if i pick up all five people the corner

365
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,510
that on that and then i take a step back to our i think about

366
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,720
five people and i want to put them all down and double them i don't

367
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,650
know that there are five anymore because africa cup for five look might be put

368
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:12,060
back in like manner i have infinitely many beekeepers infinity plus five and that looks

369
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,000
like infinity

370
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,630
that is a matter of fact if you takes cs one of three which encouraged

371
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,460
to do because i teach in the winter eventually we talk about infinity right calling

372
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,710
and it all comes back to carol not actually doesn't come back carol

373
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,530
but infinity plus any number is

374
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,600
within reason for number thirteen argue about that is still infinity

375
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,150
so that's why carol cannot account if we wifi at MTV per bag perl five

376
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,220
and look inside and then we can put down five but now we don't have

377
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,750
the minus say what you do

378
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:44,900
OK if you function doesn't look like that but instead in terms of symbols looks

379
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,180
like this you can still use the formula

380
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:54,190
or just a trivial change of variable means that you can write it as writer

381
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,160
instead now this is 1 place there's no way of writing the answer in terms

382
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:02,500
of capital letter that is 1 of those cases where this notation just no good

383
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,240
anymore I'm going to have to write it using the owner

384
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:13,320
all plus transform all of f of and wherever you see a team you choose

385
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,790
the right

386
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,120
the thing

387
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,240
basically this is the same formula that as that 1 will have to stand on

388
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,740
my head for 1 minute to try to convince you what I will do that

389
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:31,570
now what I'd like you just to take a look at the formula you should

390
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,570
know what it's called

391
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,640
there's a number of idiots who call this the exponential shift formula and beautiful ends

392
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:47,930
on the right side you multiply that exponential that corresponds to the function but fortunately

393
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,000
we pre-empted that a

394
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:56,010
we do when I could call this article Wikibook calls up the difficulty is there

395
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:02,700
is no universal designations for this formula important as it is however your book calls

396
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,700
this t axis translation formula

397
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,440
translation because I'm translating on the T access and it tells me what that's why

398
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:18,010
function essentially and this tells me what the

399
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,370
we will plus transform it

400
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:30,090
the other formula remember at the exponential shift formula the shift or the translation occurs

401
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:35,480
on the x-axis axis in other words the formula said that F of s minus

402
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,700
say you did the translation

403
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,220
In test variable corresponded to

404
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:46,220
multiplying this by

405
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,160
In other words the formulas for the dual to each other this guy translates on

406
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,960
the left side and multiplied by the exponential on the right

407
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:01,220
the formula that you know translates on the right and multiplied by the exponential on

408
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:07,290
the left again where we're gonna calculate what I'm trying to calculate so I'm trying

409
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,460
to prove this 1st formula the signal the easy and the easy consequence that I'm

410
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,400
going to calculate will plus transform that are

411
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,480
it's the integral from 0 to infinity all

412
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:28,720
either the minus st lines you will of t-minus say f of t-minus said the

413
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,770
a formula for but what I'm trying to express it in terms of the will

414
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,050
plus transform of f itself

415
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:44,520
now it's trying to be the will plus transform that the problem is that here

416
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,780
at T minus acres

417
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,610
which I don't like I would like that to be just t

418
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,020
OK now in order to not to confuse you and this is what can everybody

419
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:01,360
of will set t 1 equal to t-minus they'll change variables school changing the variable

420
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,780
and that integral

421
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,050
I change variable indefinite

422
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:16,400
integral well mostly the limits of e to the minus that's flying out t remember

423
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,640
you can change the variable for words direct substitution but now I have to use

424
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,790
the inverse substitution t

425
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:29,720
it's trivial but T is equal to T 1 + a so the change this

426
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,740
I'm a substitute backwards and make that 1

427
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,860
about the rest of the world this becomes you have T 1

428
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:43,330
this is therefore T 1 half change the dt too but that's no problem the

429
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:49,290
1 equals the because they constant so that the the 1 at the last step

430
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,370
is to put in the limits now when T is equal to 0

431
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,650
T 1 has a value negative

432
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,580
so this has to be negative and when t is infinity on infinity minus there

433
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,800
is also from

434
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:12,620
In other words this changes to that these 2 things whatever they are they have

435
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,280
the same value

436
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,400
all I've done is change the variables make a change of variables

437
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,270
but now of course I wanna make this look

438
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,240
and when you do that well

439
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,020
1st multiply out the exponential

440
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,350
and then you get a factor in the minus st 1 that's good that goes

441
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,280
so here we see that we have very small

442
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,020
so a very small number of

443
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,650
so a very high number of pages

444
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,280
the small degree

445
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,420
in degree so

446
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:52,820
if you generate the beijing you link it most likely this page new page will

447
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,790
stay stay in that in that shape

448
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,090
with very small degree and then you have very

449
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:07,660
a small number of pages with high indegree so this would be like this so

450
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,310
this would be pages like

451
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,570
google yahoo and so on so

452
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,330
so now if you

453
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,800
take all the pages the that

454
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,630
count in degree

455
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,860
draw a graph

456
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,310
and make a log log scale

457
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,260
you get to

458
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,940
straight line so this is the most characteristic footprint of the power law in the

459
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,840
so small number of pages

460
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,400
with the highest degree in very high number of pages with the

461
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,220
low integration so this is a a good example

462
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,120
the same would be four out degree but let's

463
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,650
keep this

464
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:55,170
and so the next very important concepts in social networks so whole small small world

465
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,820
small small world network is the concept where the

466
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,940
try to model the motion measure

467
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,790
what is

468
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,600
the linkage

469
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,570
how many steps do we need to go from one part of the network to

470
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,520
another part of the network

471
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,190
is called by the diameter of the of the ground

472
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,030
if we

473
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:26,520
maybe you are familiar with this concept c six degrees of separation so basically this

474
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,840
this tells people thought this was an experiment from the sixties or seventies

475
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,880
there somebody was testing one science social sciences was testing

476
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,200
people in the US are connected so how

477
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,020
one piece of information how true how many steps what you would need to go

478
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,580
so that it comes from one end to the country to the other end of

479
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:57,000
the country and on average came out that in six steps

480
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:01,540
any person is reachable from any other person in the US at the time so

481
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,140
that's why it's called six degrees of

482
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,590
separation now

483
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,230
on the that

484
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:13,700
but a few years ago to measure to what would be the

485
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,910
the degree of separation this would be

486
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:25,720
nineteen step so from in nineteen steps you can reach from any web page

487
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,660
two any

488
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:32,170
other web page on developing this main connected component course

489
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,170
actually this was shown by simulation but basically

490
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:44,200
later on i think it was confirmed by empirical studies

491
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,110
so here is one example of a small

492
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,860
one of the

493
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:02,690
in european project collaboration effort so this is the data which organelles from

494
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,720
our project is solid that so

495
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,010
we have here

496
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:12,470
eight thousand organisations which were collaborating in a roughly

497
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:17,470
three thousand four to to two hundred thousand seven hundred projects in FP five

498
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,230
so we have in this photograph

499
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,080
each node in the graph is one organisation in two organisations are connected if they

500
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,490
collaborate at least one right now the

501
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,730
the question is

502
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,810
the following how far apart are two

503
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,540
organisations such that

504
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:42,930
so the main connected part of this network so over everybody reaches everybody is roughly

505
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,230
ninety four

506
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,430
percent of all the nodes so

507
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,260
five percent of all

508
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:54,100
institutions in europe are connected somehow between each other so this is one of the

509
00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:00,630
vision and the maximum distance within this network of almost three thousand almost eight thousand

510
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,710
organisations is basically

511
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,020
seven steps

512
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,200
on average

513
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,640
we you can reach any any organisation

514
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,150
in three point one step

515
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:17,220
basically this small network is much slower of course because don't not that many

516
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:26,840
and almost forty percent of all organisations have average distance three or less

517
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,340
now if visualize this

518
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,720
so here is the

519
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,730
link linkage graph for the most connected

520
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:40,480
the most connected organisation which was this fraunhofer institute in germany

521
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,530
it's pretty large institute

522
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,730
which so

523
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:50,790
this is musician shows the following so if put fraunhofer in the media

524
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,350
and draw

525
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,540
all the institutions which collaborates

526
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,590
directly from the whole for in the first step

527
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,860
and then all the institutions

528
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,290
so each line represents one institution which if

529
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,370
i didn't draw the name because then it would be to domestic so

530
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,590
we take the glass rods

531
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,470
and we have the silk

532
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,830
in order to show you know that if i approached this neutral below

533
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,640
there's no positive charge on it

534
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,680
when it sees the positive

535
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,340
rather it will come

536
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,360
to the class

537
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,580
that's direction

538
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,070
still no charge

539
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:43,260
that's induction

540
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:54,300
many of the keep them dry

541
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,750
you may know understand

542
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,400
by rubbing amber

543
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:02,290
which the greek already knew a long time ago

544
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,040
the tracks

545
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,350
right pieces

546
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,110
obviously that induction

547
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,340
and you may also understand that if you comb your hair

548
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,360
and the come get charged

549
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,970
that you can now also pick up small pieces of paper because that's induction

550
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,980
even though those pieces are neutral

551
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,140
this phenomenon

552
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,350
will make the paper

553
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,950
good call

554
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,800
and i want to demonstrate that

555
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,540
but given the fact

556
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:35,560
the humidity is very high in this room

557
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,930
i prefer to make sure that my hair is very dry

558
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,500
so to get the maximum amount of charge

559
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,060
on that card

560
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:49,270
so even though i washed my hair this morning without that would never have worked

561
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,310
they must wash you have to do any of these experiments first but

562
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,010
i also want to

563
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,630
dry my hair because

564
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,530
that is important

565
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,290
so let's do that

566
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:21,980
so far away i don't have to do that but it's family

567
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:35,670
let's hope that that is enough

568
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,890
i small pieces of paper here

569
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,530
going to put in here and you're going to see the

570
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:48,380
projected there was a small television camera

571
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,680
and then i will call my hair

572
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,070
and i'll show you

573
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,070
where i can make a track those small pieces

574
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,380
after that first

575
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,710
television on

576
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:01,250
let me check my notes

577
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:03,540
to make sure that we have the

578
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,910
proper lighting

579
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,210
all lights off

580
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,840
and sports

581
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,190
and for all

582
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,330
there you see the

583
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,770
i'm going to

584
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:24,290
call my hair

585
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,000
there we go

586
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,140
you see that

587
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,800
some of the confetti

588
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,690
comes to me

589
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,300
but now

590
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,170
there's something

591
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,870
very special

592
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,360
some of the confetti comes to the call

593
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,650
and immediately leaves

594
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,370
one thing that is

595
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,150
why do you think that happened so

596
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,470
they became

597
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,150
i'll show you again

598
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,470
the pieces of paper

599
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,610
would be repelled by the comb

600
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,840
if you go down again to the table some of them

601
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,480
why is that

602
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:20,720
come on don't be afraid in the worst case it's wrong

603
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,170
you mean well

604
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,600
when the paper touches the call

605
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,910
because negative remember we had already decided that earlier the pieces of paper takes on

606
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:34,920
the negative charge because they touch the column noted both negative and so they repel

607
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,760
each other

608
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,450
that's fine

609
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,220
now there is another problem some pieces of paper

610
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,950
stuck on the call

611
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:51,190
show that to you again

612
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,630
you see that

613
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,350
this talk

614
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:59,310
and i'll leave you

615
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,460
the question why is that

616
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,290
i always leave my students

617
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,210
was the problem that they have to digest at home

618
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,900
you can discuss it with your parents you can discuss it with friends why is

619
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,260
it that so

620
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,880
immediately rebelled

621
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,900
but others permanently

622
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:19,410
for a long time stay on the court

623
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,090
the process of course is induction

624
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,130
that's clear

625
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,200
why do some

626
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,020
i have

627
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,750
nice collection

628
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,410
of balloons

629
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,870
but already too

630
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:47,450
if i run these balloons

631
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,410
it shouldn't surprise you that the balloon

632
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:58,760
yes try we've seen examples of

633
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,380
that's induction why does it stay there

634
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,570
the same problem with the paper and the cold

635
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:09,040
the problem with undirected graphs and factor graphs is that

636
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,860
many useful independencies are not explicitly represented

637
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:19,460
so the two variables have to be merely connected because some other variable depends on

638
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:29,540
right so this is a classic example from u there pearl wrote an important book

639
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,910
on this topic

640
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,290
where you're thinking of you know the sort of life in california you have rain

641
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:43,720
occasionally you have sprinklers for watering your garden or lawn and both these things can

642
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,420
make the ground wet

643
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,280
whether it rains or not and whether you're sprinklers or not

644
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:56,720
maybe marginally independent if you're spline is on the time for example that it ignores

645
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,980
the weather

646
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,490
the ground being wet depends on both of these things so here we have a

647
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:08,810
nice directed graph that represents these dependencies

648
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,850
if we were representing these with the factor graph or an undirected graph we would

649
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:19,300
have to join up all three of these variables into a single factor or put

650
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,620
undirected edge between these two

651
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,300
OK what we have to put this undirected edge here

652
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,480
because if we didn't put this undirected edge what would it mean well the graph

653
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:37,190
would look like this that would mean observing the ground was wet

654
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,610
would make

655
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:44,180
the probability of it having reigned or the sprinkler being on independent

656
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,050
and that's not true if we observe the ground is wet

657
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,300
there are two

658
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:54,770
reasonable explanations either rain or the sprinklers on may be both

659
00:39:54,950 --> 00:40:00,530
but certainly these two variables are not independent of each other conditionally independent given

660
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:05,330
it's a bit annoying in these undirected representations that you have to connect up lots

661
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:11,910
of things that are not a priority related just because something else depends on them

662
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:19,320
and this also sort of explains it it's the way of mentioning the whole idea

663
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,920
of explaining away

664
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,410
if you have multiple explanations for something

665
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,880
observing that this displaying sprinkler is on would explain away

666
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:33,500
the observation of the ground was wet making it less probable that it rained

667
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:40,030
OK so there's a complicated dependency between causes and effects that

668
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,800
that is well captured by

669
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,940
direct representations

670
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,510
OK so

671
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,750
let me now talk about directed graphical models

672
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:55,880
which go by several names we could call them directed basically graphical models

673
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:00,340
or bayesian networks of there's a footnote here because you can do

674
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:04,190
maximum likelihood or frequencies learning of bayesian networks

675
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,380
make use of

676
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:20,240
so the question is are the inference algorithm that they make use of this kind

677
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:27,480
of conditional independence yes so in fact the message passing belief propagation algorithms

678
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:31,420
are are really making try to make use of conditional independence

679
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:37,660
the form of the belief propagation algorithm is slightly different for directed graphs the factor

680
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,780
graphs it turns out not to make it big

681
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,880
not not make it practical

682
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,110
so is

683
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,870
well it's important if

684
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,300
it's important if you want to

685
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,120
however representation of conditional independence

686
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,950
in your graph i mean if you basically thrown away information by converting this into

687
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,110
but from the point of view the

688
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:10,570
messages they get passed around on the computer algorithm you can convert directed graph into

689
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:14,170
factor graph and you know

690
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,600
the algorithm will run correctly still

691
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:28,520
here is a directed graph we're bayesian network or sometimes called the belief network

692
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:34,740
and it corresponds to again to factorizations of joint probability distribution the joint distribution over

693
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,270
these variables

694
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:43,770
factors into a product of variables given their parents as chris already introduced so

695
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:49,460
the joint probability over x one to xn is a product over each variable

696
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:56,270
the probability of each variable given its parents so the parents

697
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,570
e are c and d

698
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,540
it was very easy to

699
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,290
independence in an undirected graph or factor graphs it's also not very hard to do

700
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,350
it is the notion of separation

701
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:19,750
in directed graphs are called this the separation

702
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,960
the dependency separation so the idea is

703
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,290
if i have the directed graph

704
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:31,290
i then x is independent of y given v

705
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,050
if the set b

706
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,660
d separates ex from y

707
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,820
so how do we determine whether

708
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,700
the d separates ex from y

709
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,020
these d separates ex from y

710
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,960
every undirected path

711
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,680
between x and y

712
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,360
is blocked by d

713
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,610
so we're basically i mean the way i like to think about this intuitively is

714
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,500
that we're trying to see what information

715
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:09,460
you can get to y and vice versa

716
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:11,600
without getting blocked by p

717
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:17,440
if the blocks all information they can get from x to y and vice versa

718
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:21,600
then x and y are independent given v

719
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:28,500
so we need to consider every undirected path right what's an undirected path well if

720
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:34,210
i have a graph like this i can consider pass on this graph

721
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:38,500
that can go either with the direction of the arrows are against the direction of

722
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,820
the arrows that would be like a

723
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:47,100
e d would be an undirected path right because i go sometimes again sometimes with

724
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,530
the direction of the

725
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:55,780
so i need to check whether it's blocked by v

726
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:59,030
and the way it's going to be blocked by the is

727
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:05,440
a path is blocked by the if there's is some node w on the path

728
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,300
such that either

729
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,340
one of these two conditions hold

734
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,160
a couple of announcements contest today

735
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,770
five o'clock in the email to my

736
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:41,020
wednesday will be

737
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,820
the test test one

738
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:46,460
i'll say a few words about that

739
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:52,810
coverage through the end of the electron

740
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,830
when c

741
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,970
so what i'm talking about today

742
00:45:56,030 --> 00:46:00,540
i will not be testing you but maybe you might pay attention because

743
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,860
about a month from now

744
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:06,180
we will ask if you skill testing questions about it but it's always pedagogical things

745
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,110
if i test right up until the last thing i say

746
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,320
i don't think that gives you enough dwell time

747
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,730
the flipside is going to be couple lectures now we're not going to be on

748
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:17,200
the test so

749
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,260
i think you will deal with it

750
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,010
one day i will be

751
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,730
giving a seminar on engineering education

752
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:29,530
halifax so in my place will be professor balancer

753
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,150
well competently substitute

754
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,560
for me and

755
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,150
keep the ball rolling

756
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,030
but i'll be back tuesday

757
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,590
contact me if you have some

758
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,030
questions in connection with the

759
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:52,150
so first thing lots of all begin with comments about the test not wave

760
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,070
i for one have to worry about running out of time the and so the

761
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:56,590
test is wednesday

762
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:57,890
the twenty ninth

763
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,730
and i'll will be written during the normal class times

764
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,730
if you take the test eleven

765
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:05,760
come here

766
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,730
there's a plurality of rules because we want to have some vacancies here

767
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:15,950
right so if your last name begins a through OK

768
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:19,080
you'll come to this room if you are

769
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:22,090
last name begins kh through y a

770
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,910
if you go to fifty three forty that's the gymnasium on the third floor walker

771
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,750
the jam up on the third floor and will accommodate a couple hundred people there

772
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,530
and for those of you at the very end of the alphabet we have a

773
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:37,440
special room for u one dash one ninety somebody has

774
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,660
some elbow room please go to the assigned role

775
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,560
by all means if your schedule two

776
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,780
ten class eleven please take the

777
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,410
test eleven

778
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:52,550
don't all come crashing into one o'clock because we don't have

779
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:55,740
the room or the

780
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,460
for the number of exams

781
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,150
please go to

782
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,590
the assigned room

783
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,750
so here's what the mechanics are

784
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:09,620
you're going to just go to the room as you normally do come on and

785
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,970
sit down

786
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,270
so i got to do just sit down

787
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,090
what's the purpose of the test by the way

788
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,180
why do i give you a test

789
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,600
it's to give you a status report

790
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:26,340
status report i want to give some feedback to tell you how you doing

791
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,840
OK how you doing so

792
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:30,270
two messages i can give you either

793
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,220
keep up the good work or

794
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,220
you better change of strategy because you're not mastering the material that's all i'm trying

795
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:36,870
to do

796
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:40,970
i'm not trying to to cross-check on the admissions process as i told you i

797
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:42,430
believe that everybody

798
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:46,190
so in this room has the intellectual apparatus to pass this class

799
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:50,720
so there's no gamesmanship here if you've been investing in the time

800
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:53,150
investing the time that i i asked you to

801
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,000
you'll pass handling there's no tricks

802
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,900
if you look at all the exams you can look at your home works that's

803
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,900
the kind of

804
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,930
questions you can expect

805
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,400
nothing to broadside you

806
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,970
on the other hand if you haven't been keeping up i hope that you will

807
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:15,840
pass so i can tell you look you get to do things differently that's all

808
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,960
bring five things with you got five fingers five things

809
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,380
periodic table

810
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,690
table of constance and you're allowed in a cheap and a half parliament sheet of

811
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:28,420
paper you can write anything you want

812
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,400
you right on the front around the back you can write on the edge i

813
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,220
don't care

814
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:36,850
you can photocopy you can follow reduce you can take everything from the last

815
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,110
ten years of three and i wanted to make a micro dots i don't care

816
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,960
what everyone

817
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:47,390
so that's three periodic table table of constants h

818
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,410
something to calculate where there will be some computations

819
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:59,030
sunday calculate with i don't care program calculating the only thing is no wireless devices

820
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:02,280
this has wireless internet and here you are going to be sending e-mails during an

821
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,470
example no computers no wireless devices

822
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,510
lord help your cell phone goes off

823
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,540
and last thing something to write with

824
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:13,400
i believe it or not i have students walk in the first thing here goes

825
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,320
upstairs to

826
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,090
i can't believe

827
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:19,530
make sure you get batteries that are

828
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,300
good state charging calculator

829
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:27,690
we don't have four hundred fifty calculators for

830
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,580
and you're right i will give you

831
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,860
the question paper just fill in

832
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,900
on the paper and then you have to bring the paper

833
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,330
fifty five minutes will start to all five will stop you fifty five

834
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,760
stop when we ask you to stop out of courtesy to your classmates everybody might

835
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,220
like a little more time fifty five stars

836
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,520
we'll have people collect them either down here at the back and

837
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:53,280
it out here in orderly fashion

838
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,290
so that's the mechanics now

839
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,300
i want you to do well

840
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,700
i want you to be able to put your best foot forward i want to

841
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:02,850
get all

842
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,320
frustrated and and failed to show

843
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,990
what you know so here's a couple tips

844
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,580
the first thing read the test

845
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:14,840
it's all you should be careful

846
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:35,450
this is for any expansion of the macro on the left-hand side

847
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,360
should be f of n

848
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:43,090
there's an expansion of the marker on the right-hand side so that we get a

849
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:49,300
OK and what this allows you to do is if you have a chain of

850
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,910
the call sign relations the chain is is then the very first one is equal

851
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:57,000
to are bounded by the very last one so you can change call signs in

852
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:00,300
the we normally would you just kept them around

853
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:05,900
so that's a big o notation any questions

854
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,730
but that

855
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:14,300
crash fingers

856
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,920
so the goal is great for expressing upper bounds but we also want to talk

857
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,210
about lower bounds

858
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,270
for algorithms we usually care about upper bounds on the running time running times at

859
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:30,040
most m squared is at most n log n to figure but sometimes we need

860
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,300
to express functions that are at least some quantity

861
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:37,670
for example will show that sorting requires at least on log n time and some

862
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,150
so we need some other notation for that

863
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:45,120
and the notation is

864
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:57,080
big omega notation and it's pretty symmetric straight out the set definition here

865
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:00,910
and we're going to write f of ten is becoming a major event in f

866
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,330
of n is at least

867
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:05,920
some constant times g

868
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:14,660
of course sufficiently margin

869
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:31,100
so basically just reversing the inequality relation between f and g

870
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,180
nothing surprising

871
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,290
just to have it there

872
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:43,590
random example and i'll get a little bit more sophisticated grid and is big omega

873
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,750
log and you should read this that up to constant factors were then is it

874
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:51,590
least logan for sufficiently large n

875
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,610
so this so omega sort of corresponds to

876
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,030
i agree the article text me

877
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,780
he some analogies

878
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,220
we have big n

879
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:07,900
they have become again this is less than or equal to

880
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:10,850
this is greater than or equal to and i'm going to fill in some more

881
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,130
here at the moment

882
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,580
i mean it's nice to have

883
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,930
all the usual operators would have normally we have strict lessons degree than an equal

884
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:38,380
sign and we want those are analogues in the asymptotic world where we ignore constant

885
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,340
factors and ignore the lower terms

886
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:46,830
so we have for example data she then this is the capital theater

887
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,520
which means you right the

888
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:51,080
horizontal bar in the middle as opposed all the way through

889
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,070
and then greeks

890
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,330
the way is

891
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:59,730
theta means that you're less likely to endure greater than or equal to

892
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,870
up to constant factors

893
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:06,830
this is the intersection of these two sets big going big mega

894
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:09,220
so that's

895
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:15,590
sort of like equal sign but of course is very different so you have things

896
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:19,810
like and squared is big of two n square you ignore

897
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:22,580
constant factors but all of these other

898
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:27,300
relations OK and squared plus bigger than is going to be better than square

899
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:32,270
but this does not hold the data because square events really bigger asymptotically bigger than

900
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:33,630
log and

901
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:38,180
and some of the other examples we saw like sanskrit verses and cuba's are those

902
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,370
don't hold with data

903
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:45,640
we have some

904
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,860
districts notation

905
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:52,850
which are the little

906
00:55:52,870 --> 00:56:00,670
and little make notation there's no little fame because there is no notion of strict

907
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:07,060
quality versus strict equality little o is going to correspond roughly to less than and

908
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,240
will make is going to correspond to a greater than

909
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,800
this is an additional just have to get used to

910
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:19,920
i'm not going to define precisely here because it's almost exactly the same the difference

911
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,840
is that instead of saying there exist constants c and not you have to say

912
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,960
for every constant c

913
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,240
there exists a constant and

914
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,100
the relationship between f and g this inequality

915
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,200
must hold for all

916
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,800
instead of just for one

917
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:50,620
and so on i can now depend on c

918
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,630
so you can assume that really n is sufficiently large but this gives you a

919
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:01,340
strict inequalities no matter what cos it you put here in front of g they

920
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:04,690
were doing little or no matter what the cost you put in front of g

921
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:09,560
f will be still less than c times g for sufficiently large

922
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:11,860
so we have some

923
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,400
random examples

924
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:21,330
and these are

925
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:26,480
these were again ignoring constants and squared is always less than and q for sufficiently

926
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,680
large n

927
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,630
and it's the principle here making could work out in order to do something like

928
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,930
this it will become intuitive

929
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:37,140
i k l make

930
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,820
certainly we were being very very happy to construct such filters

931
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:53,100
because that means that we can take any and you give me an input

932
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:57,620
and i and i take out all the high frequencies

933
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:00,960
and keep the good ones keep the good stuff

934
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:05,330
but what's the trouble with that filter

935
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,280
that i can

936
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,800
it takes a long time because right because there is no

937
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:15,760
i mean

938
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,940
that's gravel this i mean

939
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,730
all i need k all the way from minus infinity to infinity i want to

940
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:26,610
do that

941
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:28,470
right ideal filter

942
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,340
it will be i i are r

943
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:33,190
impulse response

944
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:39,860
so that i could stand for infinite and also for idea

945
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:54,670
these are

946
00:58:54,690 --> 00:59:01,320
let's see what i'm

947
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:05,320
if i'm not sure what you're adding choose

948
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:08,570
so that's what this is what my

949
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,570
what this

950
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,610
we ask about this

951
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:14,330
filter OK

952
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,880
so it computes the average

953
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:21,780
now in the frequency domain if it wipes out of making pi

954
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:25,120
because that's the alternating guy

955
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:29,770
if if my input was the some of the that's a good question my input

956
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:32,030
was the sum of

957
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:38,110
d term and pure alternations

958
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:43,130
yeah but i was going to what what would be the input well what so

959
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:45,660
what input when i be talking about that

960
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,210
oppose i had

961
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,370
the inputs

962
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,530
for me was there are many who live is another good example so there's one

963
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:58,850
input with that give me

964
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,620
one two one two or zero to

965
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:02,630
there are two

966
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:08,770
right if i if i literally adamantly zero to zero to zero two

967
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:15,160
and what with the output b

968
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,560
o once it's beautiful

969
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:20,760
keeps averaging no zeros in two

970
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:23,730
and the average and the output would be o one

971
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:29,480
now that's a good example

972
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,680
so this is not a pure frequency

973
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:34,310
the some of

974
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:39,200
it's assigned to some of two frequencies right

975
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:43,540
right right right

976
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:48,980
so where do we get to we got to this idea of filter but we

977
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:54,790
what to do

978
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:59,120
this is certainly the most of the problem that everybody face

979
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:00,570
so they started

980
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,390
creating filters

981
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,670
we want this

982
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,840
but it's asking too much so what shall we do

983
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,600
well the natural way idea is

984
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:17,210
take these we could figure out these numbers right

985
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,210
because these are

986
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,600
this is the this is the fourier series of the function

987
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:27,430
what i have to say it again because i just love

988
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:34,140
there are no function and here's its fourier series

989
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:38,490
and we know the fourier coefficients of the square wave

990
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:42,450
they die off at what rate

991
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:45,760
this just linear linearly one or k

992
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,390
bad news

993
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,570
so if we truncate this

994
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:53,760
and then we have a thousand are still throwing away

995
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,070
pretty big stuff

996
01:01:56,090 --> 01:02:00,300
and we have a tremendously long filter

997
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,950
and what it suppose i go from minus two thousand one thousand

998
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:08,380
and i i use the same numbers

999
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:11,490
well even when we don't have a problem

1000
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:16,930
suppose i just truncated is that a good idea or not

1001
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:21,070
in order to ensure should be somewhat ideal right

1002
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:27,780
anyway way it's the optimal it's the it's it's the idealist filter we could create

1003
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,030
in some sense

1004
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:34,450
and what would the picture looks like this

1005
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:36,200
what's the

1006
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,430
what's the

1007
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:42,220
so now i have another function

1008
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,050
chapter one hundred

1009
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:51,950
and what's what's the graph of the function of phi

1010
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:54,780
it has the gibbs phenomenon

1011
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:59,820
this is exactly what they get from the owners take the fourier series for

1012
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,470
four true step

1013
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:04,320
and shop

1014
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,490
so if i graph this it would be really accurate here but it would get

1015
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:09,910
worse and worse

1016
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:15,640
worst of course right there that would do a good very good job drop down

1017
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,160
and then it would

1018
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:21,280
this would be a little envelope

1019
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,260
of rebels

1020
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,300
there are there

1021
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,360
it would be

1022
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,970
unpleasantly large

1023
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:36,740
right at that frequency

1024
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,160
all right so

1025
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,660
feel the designers

1026
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:44,050
that's this is actually the closest function

1027
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:49,360
this ripley guy this polynomial so that's the polynomial time to read two hundred years

1028
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,950
and the course it goes the other way too

1029
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:55,970
it's going to be some

1030
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:57,010
so that

1031
01:03:57,030 --> 01:04:00,990
now in what sense is

1032
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,450
is that ripley

1033
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,530
unpleasant looking or little sort of

1034
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:10,590
no worrying because because this height

1035
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:14,550
a fixed number

1036
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:19,610
ah what sense i said it was really the best possible in a certain sense

1037
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:21,780
and what is the sense in which

1038
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:25,340
that's the closest function to the idea

1039
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,260
and two

1040
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:29,160
if i measure the error

1041
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:31,950
the difference between those two functions

1042
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,640
and integrate square

1043
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:37,860
i've got a small i can get

1044
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:41,720
because that's for it because this is an orthonormal

1045
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:46,390
and if i take an orthonormal basis

1046
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:53,530
in the l two norm everything it's obscure projection use the same numbers and this

1047
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:55,930
set the other numbers to zero

1048
01:04:55,950 --> 01:05:00,240
that's all too so there you seem to

1049
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,800
an advantage of l two it's so nice to compute with with and after all

1050
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,120
we just did was truncated

1051
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:09,590
the drawback is

1052
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:11,890
o point wise it

1053
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,470
that is really not is not perfect

1054
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:19,010
OK suppose i wanted so now tell me what

1055
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:25,030
one thing

1056
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:28,050
but it turns that this definition is still wrong even when you make sense of

1057
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,800
can be it's not it's not enough to be given y for free that's the

1058
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,900
wrong notion

1059
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,980
what you have to be given for free is

1060
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:40,280
and elegant

1061
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:48,890
an elegant self-limiting program for y

1062
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:50,750
four y

1063
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:56,530
and that's more than that given y directly you're given y indirectly the it

1064
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:59,710
the best theory for elegant program calculates

1065
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:02,890
and this is more than do you mean you from that you can get y

1066
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:05,820
by running the program but you know more than y

1067
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,050
you also know

1068
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,750
the complexity of why because if you're given

1069
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,200
the most concise program for y that's a y so you you know more

1070
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:22,200
OK now why is this definition of this revised definition of relative complexity of

1071
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,040
the right definition

1072
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:28,670
well the reason the right definition is because you get the following fundamental result which

1073
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:31,280
is true in shannon information theory

1074
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:32,740
as an identity

1075
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:38,240
but it

1076
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:44,520
it's very it's an important result is not an identity in

1077
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,880
algorithmic information theory

1078
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:50,330
so what does this result say

1079
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:54,180
it says what this means you know you're all mathematicians who i i know i

1080
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,690
was impressed by all the

1081
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,000
so you know everyone knows what order of unity is something that the difference between

1082
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,130
the two sides is bound to write about the number of this this is the

1083
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:06,940
size in bits of the smallest program that calculates from the calculates the pair of

1084
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,100
objects x and y produces two

1085
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:13,040
output this is the size of the smallest program just for x and this is

1086
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,830
the size of the smallest program

1087
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:19,630
suffering from the content why if you're given that x

1088
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,250
for free but you're given

1089
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:26,790
you're given

1090
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,420
an elegant program for x

1091
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:31,170
which is exactly the same as being given that the nature of x by the

1092
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:36,650
so in when you do that then you get this resolved now this result without

1093
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:40,570
the class sort of unity is an identity and shannon information theory

1094
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,010
and when i got this result i said now i have the right definition of

1095
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:45,800
problem size complexity

1096
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:49,160
so it's not enough to make the programmes of limiting you also have to change

1097
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,940
the definition of relative complexity

1098
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:54,710
and then you get out of this beautiful result which is a very

1099
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:57,210
major results

1100
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:59,860
so that when i said i have the right theory

1101
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,040
so this was

1102
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:05,180
a paper that i published in nineteen seventy five in the journal of the ACM

1103
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:08,750
and the title is an advertisement that was like a medieval title instead a theory

1104
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,930
of program size from identical to

1105
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:15,580
information theory that there was just one information theory was shannon information theory at this

1106
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:16,740
point there

1107
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:21,390
in my view to information theory is the shannon ensemble probabilistic information theory

1108
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:24,140
from communications engineering and is the algorithm

1109
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:28,230
information theory we to basically talking about the size in bits of computer program

1110
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,140
so now there are two

1111
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:30,950
but they

1112
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:36,860
they have some similarities and this this result is is is is a similar

1113
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:40,760
so i don't want to get into the technical i don't want to give you

1114
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,420
a survey of the

1115
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,170
of the of the theory

1116
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:48,500
because there isn't enough time but this is one way to resolve this i was

1117
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,760
talking to you about the

1118
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:51,540
about the history of this field

1119
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,050
but you see in my view the as i said the main application of all

1120
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:58,090
of these ideas it's nice that you get these results because it shows you have

1121
01:08:58,090 --> 01:08:59,780
the right definitions

1122
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:05,650
but but in my view the real reason for creating this theory is is to

1123
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:09,510
look at is to try to find places in pure mathematics where there is no

1124
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:11,950
structure where things are patterns

1125
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:15,540
of where things have maximum possible information content

1126
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,740
a maximum possible complexity

1127
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:23,230
and and that areas of math with with with irreducible complexity will be interesting because

1128
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:26,580
they'll be places where we can understand what's going on

1129
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:31,110
the places where things look random essentially even though it's pure map

1130
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:34,140
that was the reason

1131
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:38,180
that was that was my motivation for doing all of this and

1132
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:43,810
i think i'm the only person who really has been working on this

1133
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:46,940
there have been other people working in this field but they tend to be more

1134
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:49,090
interested or even technical

1135
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:52,470
stuff or in an application stated time complexity

1136
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:56,830
there is an industry which looks the program size

1137
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,960
and tries to use ideas from program size to help

1138
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,900
on questions involving time complexity

1139
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,990
and those questions and interest me

1140
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,530
so what i said

1141
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:11,240
i think the really interesting question now that you have the general notion of structure

1142
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:14,780
is to try to find some place with no structure and i told you that

1143
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:18,800
the first example i gave you is one place which thing which had no structure

1144
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,690
of the bits of any elegant program

1145
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:28,060
you know that irreducible complexity but let me give you my best example

1146
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,680
my best example

1147
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,580
it is the halting probability omega

1148
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:37,460
so this is a place

1149
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:43,100
pure math probability

1150
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,300
this is the place in pure mathematics

1151
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:52,180
where you can define something you find something that has absolutely no structure

1152
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:56,190
so let me tell you about this

1153
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,800
what is this not so the idea is to show that this is to get

1154
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:03,750
a worse incompleteness and the kind of ghetto in nineteen thirty one

1155
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,830
and actually this

1156
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,760
the whole the probability omega actually comes not from knows where

1157
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:11,500
although the goal is to

1158
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:15,410
look at incompleteness it comes actually more from turing nineteen thirty six work on the

1159
01:11:15,410 --> 01:11:16,690
halting problem

1160
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,840
that's the famous paper in the proceedings of the london society

1161
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:23,430
and doesn't talk about the halting problem you don't see that that

1162
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:29,280
in the paper but it's really buried there it's in their the time of the

1163
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:33,980
papers on computable numbers and about real numbers with an application to the shapes the

1164
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:38,660
that was the nineteen thirty six famous paper by turning

1165
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,360
so turning twenty shows in this paper and i just showed you in the previous

1166
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:45,890
the women

1167
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:51,560
shift the focus away from the husband on to

1168
01:11:56,240 --> 01:12:00,810
generation younger clearly that the water that's clearly a reflection of the fact that

1169
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,920
peacock hit left people

1170
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:06,880
clearly reflection the fact that grandchildren started coming so

1171
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:11,210
the women are operating much more strategically into their placings there

1172
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:14,320
their social capital and investing time

1173
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:15,890
shifting away from

1174
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:19,170
the thee

1175
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:20,490
husband as it were

1176
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:24,040
to the daughter and the grandchildren has these become

1177
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:30,620
more important to the more demanding and you don't see anything like that happen in the males and it's also

1178
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:32,010
if you look at the blue and

1179
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:35,220
red lines are pretty much identical in there

1180
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:41,010
lower left-hand peak and the peak is much lower than those the male and female children

1181
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:42,870
look at the difference with

1182
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:44,240
the women here

1183
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:49,770
you have is very high strong peak for the children and the preference a very striking preference

1184
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,470
the female the daughter over the sum

1185
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,600
okay so just an indication really sometimes

1186
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:03,110
how good these databases can be if you ask the right kinds questions if you like this is

1187
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:04,650
the data with there

1188
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:10,980
that is only because we started to ask these kinda questions that these can results so came out again

1189
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,910
so this is a reflection of the fact that

1190
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,790
creating relationships requires you to invest time the work it

1191
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:22,800
and here is evidence that this is really true if you look at them in a cora five best friends

1192
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,950
some of about half of them will be family of whom will be

1193
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,060
true friends and biological sense

1194
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:32,140
averages about five

1195
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:34,060
but if few

1196
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:38,320
also people who are in a relationship romantic relationship

1197
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,810
how many best friends they've got

1198
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,250
defined in the same way

1199
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,150
on average you come up with a figure of about four

1200
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:50,950
they have won a best and that's including the part where it won best friend

1201
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:53,140
fewer people who aren't in a relationship

1202
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:55,820
so this is evidence that falling in love

1203
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:58,220
is expensive it costs you a friend

1204
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:05,960
but it actually cost you to friends because remember if in forest you'll romantic partner

1205
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:10,350
and you don't normally fall in love with somebody who's already in your in a circle a five

1206
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:13,050
not least because to them probably family

1207
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:15,260
what you the person who

1208
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:19,490
u fall in love with this comes in from the outside i way out and

1209
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:21,180
a hundred and fifty is origami

1210
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:23,650
so to get a four

1211
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:30,150
from five hand include sector person you've actually lost two friends from the in a circle you've sacrifice them

1212
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,240
now there could be serious because if you sacrifice

1213
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,710
well maybe if you sacrifice to

1214
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:42,430
family it might not have such a big effect on their willingness to come to your aid

1215
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,420
in future but can be or to friends

1216
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:48,730
on the shoulders you need to cry later

1217
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:53,370
and if you sacrifice both your friends you've got no shoulders

1218
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:57,160
because family tend to be a little less sympathetic

1219
01:14:58,650 --> 01:14:59,210
so what

1220
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:04,180
amazingly what people do is they sacrifice typically one family member one friend

1221
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,050
so they still keep one friend one-shouldered crime

1222
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:10,810
and then they rely on the fact that family

1223
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:14,350
relationships will be less badly affected by

1224
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,490
not interacting with them so much

1225
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:21,880
a there will still come to help in the future so long very subtle behavior going on here

1226
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,220
work kind interesting

1227
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:29,490
the birds-of-a-feather story

1228
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:32,620
i'm offaly which we've already heard about earlier this morning

1229
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:35,530
we were interested in in

1230
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:44,800
what is that determines friendships and the quality of friendships andrey had based on on the original birds-of-a-feather idea

1231
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:46,330
the idea that

1232
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:51,760
you could kinda drop profile friends on the rather like a personality profile

1233
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,080
so we get a very large sample of people

1234
01:15:56,990 --> 01:16:01,140
a list of things that they might show twenty one things they might share

1235
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:06,030
friends and family members of the network is a pig one

1236
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:07,720
oh by the way

1237
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:13,360
if we go back to this another big part of disease chronic disease

1238
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:17,910
that's related to diet is the physical activity part of the equation is all discussed

1239
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:21,250
in the class and most of you probably know this your body weight is a

1240
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:25,410
function of how many calories you take and how many calories you burn off through

1241
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:29,960
metabolic processes but also physical activity and it used to be a lot easier to

1242
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,440
be physically active than it is today

1243
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:36,970
and we'll discuss this later in the class but energy saving devices all over the

1244
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:41,920
place you guys use computers i use the typewriter when i started college

1245
01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:46,500
so i was burning more calories creating a paper then you guys have two and

1246
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:50,030
that would seem like a lot of calories but you add that up across

1247
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:54,300
lecture grudge door openers and electric toothbrushes and

1248
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:58,030
windows on your car that you no longer have to crank and of course you

1249
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:00,670
don't have to get up and go across the room to change the channel on

1250
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:02,340
the television any longer

1251
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:06,160
these things contribute alot to a calorie deficit

1252
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:10,110
that used to be of there's a calorie the there's the deficit and how many

1253
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:13,940
calories people were burning compared to before and part of that is

1254
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,390
our environment

1255
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:19,510
and the way the environment structured a group of people in the united states and

1256
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:24,920
elsewhere who study something called the built environment how the environment is built affects how

1257
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:28,610
much physical activity we get so let's look back at this picture here

1258
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,460
so let's just say

1259
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,010
you have a child

1260
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:37,220
will up here say in this cul-de-sac

1261
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:40,930
and his friends with the child who lives over here

1262
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,550
that's probably not very long distances the kind of distance work it could easily write

1263
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:49,670
but of course no parents going to let the child right about from here to

1264
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:52,260
here because you've got the superhighway in the middle

1265
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:55,000
and the only way to get across it would be to go down here on

1266
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,420
this very busy road figure out how to navigate over here even if there is

1267
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:01,800
a walkway that one could write a

1268
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:04,160
and then maneuver over here

1269
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:10,280
and so the the introduction of the superhighway which divides these communities into really affects

1270
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,320
physical activity a

1271
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:16,310
you have another example of that that would

1272
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:17,170
that would be

1273
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:21,050
true is let's say you have a child who lives in this sort of

1274
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:23,850
circular area here who lives

1275
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:27,650
and his friends with the child who was here

1276
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:32,010
then that's not very long distance probably easily walkable in a few minutes but that

1277
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:34,410
child can be walking through everybody's yard

1278
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:37,070
so how do you get there you gotta go here here and these could be

1279
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:41,000
busy roads and so parents don't want to do it because of safety reasons so

1280
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,300
you see how when the country used to be laid out in a grid

1281
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:48,280
it's a new york city still is today than people walk to get places but

1282
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:52,870
when you have things like this which is typical of suburban developments it affects the

1283
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,420
physical activity lot

1284
01:18:55,450 --> 01:19:00,940
there have been some interesting surveys about people's relationship with food

1285
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:06,720
and the pew foundation this survey that was published in april two thousand six

1286
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:11,190
but as as people how much how to find out what percentage of people really

1287
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:13,330
enjoy eating

1288
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:16,850
and in the from nineteen eighty nine to two thousand six there was a pretty

1289
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:18,570
significant decline

1290
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:23,590
but even into the in nineteen eighty nine the numbers were very high

1291
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,840
now there was probably a time when people enjoy eating more

1292
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:31,320
they were eating all the time the meeting was confined to three meals a day

1293
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:35,390
it was more likely to be a social event because the family was together

1294
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,590
and the food had more

1295
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:40,640
per head better personal relationship for

1296
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:43,850
but why in the world over that period of time

1297
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:49,080
people's relationships with food get even worse

1298
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:54,200
well it has to do with our distance from food our psychological and physical distance

1299
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,670
from food and the fact that we don't appreciate it as much as we do

1300
01:19:57,670 --> 01:20:00,420
because it's everywhere all the time

1301
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:05,090
and we've been trained to eat outside of the normal mealtimes

1302
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:08,080
how many of you have seen the talk about all

1303
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:12,860
series of advertisments for the fourth meal

1304
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,450
common one people see that now what that means is no longer three mills efficient

1305
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:19,090
there has to be a four

1306
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:22,570
people are eating late at night reading early in the morning they are basically in

1307
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:26,110
all the time so this is not a very positive sign people are having a

1308
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:30,230
bad relationship with what can be what can be done to turn around

1309
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,350
in the same hole

1310
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:37,210
people were asked if they were eating more junk food in asia and men and

1311
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:40,670
women both set in pretty high numbers that they were eating more junk food and

1312
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:41,560
they should

1313
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:45,640
i hope that would be a small percentage of the population will be affected by

1314
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:49,810
this but it's not turns out to be a very high number so we have

1315
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:51,450
to ask why is this

1316
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:57,690
why are people eating too much junk food will be are gases

1317
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:59,850
what of the factors that have

1318
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:06,410
so availability and cost become two key issues yes in somebody else there

1319
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:09,860
say OK

1320
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:13,170
OK marketing is a big factor yes

1321
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:16,560
taste good

1322
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:22,210
OK so it's not only available sort of out there all over the place but

1323
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,330
it's easy

1324
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:27,140
you can be it can be security easily it can be made easily in the

1325
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:30,460
microwave or things like that that's all true any other ideas

1326
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:35,380
so OK is part of the social system that we're in yes

1327
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:38,490
OK it's

1328
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:45,370
right it's easy because there's less cleaning less preparation and things right

1329
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:50,680
OK that's a very interesting issue about the the response was that because the

1330
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:52,990
other food might expire quickly

1331
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:57,160
so that's true appearing in things like fruits and vegetables they only have a certain

1332
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,500
amount of life before they go bad a lot of these processed foods have very

1333
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,910
long shelf lives

1334
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:07,070
and therefore can be stored for long periods of time they can be on store

1335
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:10,010
shelves for a long period of time there has to do with economics of food

1336
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:12,300
especially food available to the poor

1337
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:16,560
which will discuss later OK these are you guys are all right everything that i

1338
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,280
heard was the correct answer now the people in this poll were asked the same

1339
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:27,020
and here's what they said to seventy three percent said that one reason is that

1340
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:32,930
it's more convenient it's what people like to eat it's heavily advertised it's more affordable

1341
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:36,780
people may not know which foods are healthy so those are all reasons

1342
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:38,860
you guys mentioned now

1343
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,550
what you might do about this let's say that we

1344
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:46,360
that year the surgeon general or you're the top health official in some country

1345
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:49,280
and you agree with this poor people are in too much johnson so we can

1346
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,900
do about it

1347
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:56,510
you've decided to probabilities choosing things and then you've got back can the then got

1348
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:01,160
actually turned into an algorithm to how to choose things about probability because you want

1349
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:07,260
to choose a finite populations so the standard ways roulette wheel sampling where you make

1350
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:08,130
pockets of your

1351
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:13,610
roulette equal to their fitness and then you just platelet p times to get new

1352
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:15,210
members of the population

1353
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:23,550
and the problem is that is you can fluctuations you could get all members of

1354
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:28,180
the population ending up released for members of your

1355
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:34,220
your new population you could be very unlucky and always the loser let's get released

1356
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:36,670
a member of your population

1357
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:40,720
or you could get always if affects members of the population minimizer those what you

1358
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:45,700
you want to have something you want to maintain diversity

1359
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:52,410
so there's another way of doing this called stochastic universal sampling she was proposed by

1360
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:56,750
well you basically the

1361
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:05,530
you choose one random number and then equal interview intervals around the wheel

1362
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:09,550
you can place balls in a safe place

1363
01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:13,830
people's around at equal intervals around OK

1364
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:22,760
this again also use select all members of the crew probabilities they give you many

1365
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:26,440
less fluctuations severs many

1366
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,900
let's ways

1367
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:30,490
of getting right of

1368
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,490
sampling happening

1369
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:39,180
and the proportion of times so members selected is very close to the probability so

1370
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:42,330
this is a better way of doing something that is in no way

1371
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:46,530
but this is a better thing to do is actually faster to implement the normal

1372
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:51,590
rule that was something do anything is personally i prefer that will sampling because it's

1373
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:57,760
much easier to do the mathematics and something from this that the mathematics and this

1374
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,980
turns out to be not something to actually

1375
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:05,880
exactly compute how to do that that's a silly point defining is if you really

1376
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:06,480
using e GA

1377
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:10,510
he stochastic universal sampling there's no reason not to

1378
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:15,670
it's not gonna make a huge difference for use against improved performance

1379
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:21,610
so configuration is the genetic code operations are configuration is usually

1380
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:27,480
represented as a string it doesn't have to be represented as a string in seventeen

1381
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:35,030
genetic programming usually don't use strings use much more complicated

1382
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:36,780
trees and things like that

1383
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:44,880
and you can think of the working at two levels at the genetic level so

1384
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:49,420
modify the string irrespective of the problem or the phenotypic level

1385
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:56,650
the operators actually you think have a common problem irrespective of representation

1386
01:25:56,820 --> 01:26:04,210
so you can sort of thing of two kinds of operations of genetic operations which

1387
01:26:04,210 --> 01:26:05,170
is what i

1388
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:11,360
more that's been talking about the city typical mutations of crossover and these are sort

1389
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:17,570
general purpose operations you can work on all strings but they tend to be done

1390
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:20,070
imitations you just mutate

1391
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:22,550
things done

1392
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:28,590
so the provinces of representation in order to get these changes work well you have

1393
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:33,760
to have good representations the other thing you can do is phenotypic operates as you

1394
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,960
can think of what they're doing on the phenotype of the problem

1395
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:41,800
these after be special purpose because it depend on the problem

1396
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:44,760
so this is two ways of thinking about

1397
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:49,670
how to do GA you can think about your problem and think about what operators

1398
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:54,960
you want to do good moves and problem or you can just think dumbly back

1399
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:58,300
you've got string doing dumb things on the string

1400
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:02,920
and the more you have to do saying how to represent my problem well on

1401
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:10,710
that string representing to make that strings to may be dumb operations good

1402
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:12,400
of the time

1403
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:18,030
so so there is no

1404
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:26,530
and since you certainly not doing on services and this is certainly not darwinian so

1405
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:27,510
i'm scanners

1406
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:32,460
so for instance OK so one of the things we will see later is as

1407
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,300
good ways of doing crossover four

1408
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:43,710
and for the colouring graph coloring problem very really means you know what

1409
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:45,300
heart of

1410
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:48,310
and now if I express that the

1411
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:51,020
but but but but but but

1412
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:55,530
as matrices

1413
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:58,970
because you knew that was coming that's what I have

1414
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:02,190
this is my goal

1415
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:09,570
an orthogonal basis and the normally even bases in the row space

1416
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:13,330
and an orthonormal basis in the columns space

1417
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:18,690
so that I'm sort of diagonalize the nature of the matrix A is like getting

1418
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:21,240
converted to a diagonal matrix thing

1419
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:27,400
and you notice that usually I have to do I have to allow myself to

1420
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,450
different places

1421
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:34,730
but my my little comment about symmetric positive definite was the 1 case

1422
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:38,950
it's a q equal q signal

1423
01:28:38,970 --> 01:28:41,360
where V and you the same q

1424
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:42,600
but mostly

1425
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:48,900
I you know undertaken a matrix like 0 let me take a matrix like for

1426
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:52,090
minus 3 3

1427
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:56,260
there's a 2 by 2 matrix

1428
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:59,830
it's invertible so as

1429
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:02,280
but it has rank to

1430
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:06,640
so I'm gonna look for 2 vectors V 1 and V 2

1431
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:08,470
and the in the row space

1432
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:10,400
and you saw on the looked for

1433
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,180
the 1 of the 2

1434
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:15,050
in the row space

1435
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:17,470
which of course is too

1436
01:29:17,570 --> 01:29:24,210
and I know look for you want you to do in the column space

1437
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:27,430
which of course is also plotted

1438
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:30,660
and I'm going to look for numbers signal 1

1439
01:29:30,730 --> 01:29:32,280
and sigma to

1440
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:38,240
so that it all comes out right so these guys are thought awesome normal

1441
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:44,380
these guys are orthonormal and these are the scaling factor so I'll do that example

1442
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:45,950
assume as I

1443
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:48,730
get the matrix picture straight

1444
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,600
you see that this

1445
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:56,280
expresses what I want can I just say

1446
01:29:56,330 --> 01:29:59,160
2 words about null space

1447
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:00,310
if we have

1448
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:03,510
if the null space

1449
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:10,100
then we got what we want to move in a basis for for that so

1450
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,780
here comes the basis for the null space the

1451
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:15,980
all plus 1 down

1452
01:30:16,330 --> 01:30:22,230
so if if we only had an dimensional rose space and the other n minus

1453
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:28,250
dimensions were in the null space OK it would take an orthogonal orthonormal bases there's

1454
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:28,850
no problem

1455
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:32,660
and then would just get 0

1456
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:37,570
so actually would no zeros will come out from the from the head on the

1457
01:30:37,570 --> 01:30:42,730
diagonal matrix so what I'll complete that 2 of

1458
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:44,740
the 2 of

1459
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:47,400
orthonormal basis for the whole

1460
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:54,450
I complete this to an orthonormal basis for the whole space and I complete that

1461
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:56,590
was 0

1462
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:58,620
null space

1463
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:02,860
no problem here that is so it really

1464
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:08,100
the true the true problem is in a matrix like that which is symmetric so

1465
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:11,950
I can't use its eigenvectors they're not orthogonal

1466
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:14,930
but somehow I have to get these

1467
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:18,380
orthogonal in fact orthonormal

1468
01:31:19,690 --> 01:31:23,300
that make it work

1469
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:28,120
I I have to find this these or normal guys these orthonormal guys and I

1470
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:37,230
we want to be signal what you want and a unique to be signature muted

1471
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:41,230
that's my goal

1472
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:44,370
in the area of the

1473
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:48,070
matrices they're gonna get me

1474
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:53,230
now these are orthogonal matrices I can put that if I multiply on both both

1475
01:31:53,230 --> 01:31:54,780
sides by the inverse

1476
01:31:55,450 --> 01:31:58,970
I have a equals you

1477
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:01,760
signal the inverse

1478
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:04,090
and of course

1479
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,860
you know the other way I can write the

1480
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:09,190
this is 1 of those square error

1481
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,240
orthogonal matrices

1482
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:14,070
so it's the same as you

1483
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:16,350
sigma the transfer

1484
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:22,760
here's my problem

1485
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:25,850
I got to

1486
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:28,430
orthogonal matrices you

1487
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:31,140
and I don't wanna find them both at once

1488
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:34,760
so I want to cook up some expressions

1489
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:38,350
that will make them

1490
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:40,380
you disappear

1491
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:43,840
I would like to make users apparently we only with the

1492
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:46,790
and here's how to do it

1493
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:53,140
it is it's the same combination that keeps showing up whenever we have a general

1494
01:32:53,140 --> 01:33:00,480
rectangular matrix then it's a transpose that's the great matrix

1495
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,500
that's the great many

1496
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:05,230
that's the matrix is symmetric

1497
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:10,140
and in fact positive definite or at least positive semidefinite because of the matrix with

1498
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:13,330
nice properties so let's see what will it

1499
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:16,000
so if I took a transpose there

1500
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:18,830
I would have A transpose A will be

1501
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:23,070
what would I have I transpose that I have

1502
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:30,380
segment transpose nu transpose that's that's the A transpose now the

1503
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:33,190
and what guess

1504
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:42,150
was like worse because it's got 6 things now together but it's going to

1505
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:48,120
collapse into something what did you transpose you collapse into

1506
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:53,350
the identity so that's the key point this is the identity and we don't have

1507
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:55,880
you anymore

1508
01:33:55,900 --> 01:34:00,880
and sigma trend post time segment of the diagonal matrices

1509
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:04,730
so the product is just going to have sigma squared on the diagonal so do

1510
01:34:04,730 --> 01:34:09,140
you see what we've got here this is the

1511
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:16,900
times this easy matrix signal 1 squared sigma 2 squared times the transfer

1512
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:21,310
this is the this is the A transpose that this is what we copy down

1513
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:26,360
A transpose A is that

1514
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:31,090
user out of the picture anomaly having to choose the bees and what are these

1515
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:37,550
movies and what are the signals

1516
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:40,190
you know what that these are

1517
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:45,000
there are the eigenvectors the this is a perfect

1518
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:48,280
eigen vector eigen value

1519
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:51,730
Q land q transpose

1520
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,740
for the matrix A transpose A

1521
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,930
a itself is like nothing special

1522
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:01,520
but A transpose

1523
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,590
has the zero mean

1524
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:08,100
so we can only be

1525
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:13,870
expectation the expectation of conditional expectation given the

1526
01:35:14,830 --> 01:35:18,170
axes on g minus one

1527
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:22,430
are then

1528
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:25,610
these these up i is the function

1529
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:30,470
this less than or equal to g minus one

1530
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:35,350
so these supply is the function of the conditions here

1531
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,650
so i can move all the

1532
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:41,940
these are by

1533
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:45,170
this is equal to the con expectation of these

1534
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:46,800
but i can be

1535
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:49,560
conditional expectation but the

1536
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:54,550
because of the definition of the martingale difference the conditional expectation is there

1537
01:35:54,570 --> 01:35:58,320
so i you're there

1538
01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:14,610
yeah i i you know it almost

1539
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:34,260
the conditional if given but i would like to what

1540
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:48,350
these are all random variables

1541
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:50,580
calculate this one

1542
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:53,270
because the in the graph

1543
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:54,900
with respect to the

1544
01:36:54,910 --> 01:36:57,210
conditional distribution of the

1545
01:36:57,210 --> 01:37:03,820
and given that it

1546
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:09,280
well i have here that these are uncorrelated

1547
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,780
i showed you that under fairly general conditions

1548
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:19,830
the average the the media were

1549
01:37:19,890 --> 01:37:25,810
of the that the is square of the average goes zero

1550
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:28,150
OK let's calculate

1551
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:29,850
this one

1552
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:35,640
but we being the color of the the average is one of our and were

1553
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:40,310
that the expectation of all across product

1554
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:45,030
but if i is not equal to j

1555
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:50,330
this expectation is there

1556
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:51,580
so only

1557
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:59,930
those terms are non-zero for which i is equal to j

1558
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:04,630
what were and were

1559
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,220
times the farm

1560
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:10,520
of the second moment of four

1561
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,070
of the set

1562
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:14,360
but you for example or

1563
01:38:14,410 --> 01:38:19,000
these sequences barmby

1564
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:25,150
then the star and the involved sequence divided by and we're going to zero so

1565
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:33,320
as soon as the fact that the the second moment that are bonded then

1566
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:36,520
we had a weak law of large numbers

1567
01:38:36,530 --> 01:38:43,610
that the average goes to zero emus were that

1568
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:48,780
i forgot to mention that on the wiki i have a survey paper

1569
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:53,030
it so everything in detail

1570
01:38:54,130 --> 01:38:56,790
is written in the in the paper for

1571
01:38:56,790 --> 01:39:00,140
and also the slides are there

1572
01:39:01,970 --> 01:39:03,430
not harmful

1573
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:10,060
use the martingale difference property for a general problem

1574
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:13,750
hope to construct martingale difference

1575
01:39:13,790 --> 01:39:16,520
four a problem

1576
01:39:16,610 --> 01:39:20,780
i assume that you have that y sequence

1577
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:24,840
which is a function of x i

1578
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:31,460
and then in the use the

1579
01:39:37,490 --> 01:39:39,240
and my nose

1580
01:39:39,290 --> 01:39:44,280
the conditional expectation of y and given the media sector

1581
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:45,700
it's a construction

1582
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:51,080
i in any way i call it as the

1583
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:57,500
and the claim is that the fuzzy and is a martingale difference sequence

1584
01:39:57,510 --> 01:40:02,600
putting a different sequence had the requirement one is that the only the function of

1585
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:06,770
x one x two xn it's five because y is a function of x one

1586
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:10,730
x two two x then you there is the conditional expectation is the function of

1587
01:40:10,830 --> 01:40:18,020
x one x two two x minus one so the first is of course

1588
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:24,120
now we have to calculate the conditional expectation of the given the actually the previous

1589
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,100
axis OK

1590
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:30,990
definition of the

1591
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:37,150
and calculate the conditional expectation for the first there

1592
01:40:37,210 --> 01:40:38,990
given the axes

1593
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:42,250
and the second is given that which is the

1594
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:44,220
it means that a

1595
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:50,180
the difference is that in and the limit but it's obvious there

1596
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:51,700
but in this

1597
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:53,290
just looking at the next

1598
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:56,130
very wide to the function of

1599
01:40:56,160 --> 01:41:01,100
actually it in this way we introduce artificially

1600
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:04,340
martingale difference sequence is

1601
01:41:04,350 --> 01:41:06,000
and in this way

1602
01:41:06,510 --> 01:41:10,780
you can have a little large numbers

1603
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:15,300
for these differences

1604
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:18,050
because of the previous she OK

1605
01:41:18,050 --> 01:41:21,200
so we have to go back to the optimality

1606
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:24,950
i repeat the definition

1607
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:29,030
a be star

1608
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:31,320
the local optimally

1609
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:34,580
OK i have to prove that the

1610
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:40,190
again this is a copy of the one of the views she i have to

1611
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:42,730
to prove that all around

1612
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,080
these average

1613
01:41:44,110 --> 01:41:45,630
cannot be better

1614
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:48,310
the other average

1615
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:49,420
growth rate

1616
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:50,800
it is that the

1617
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:57,050
not here to prove

1618
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:04,160
look at the the restart the average growth rate of these have been very awful

1619
01:42:04,170 --> 01:42:05,830
you actually

1620
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:11,000
it is an average of the logarithmic there

1621
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,500
it's been my

1622
01:42:12,510 --> 01:42:15,810
y variable

1623
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:17,520
from which

1624
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:20,000
i derive

1625
01:42:20,090 --> 01:42:21,810
marking different

1626
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:27,080
all to do this

1627
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:29,860
i had

1628
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:32,300
and for problem

1629
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,730
the same

1630
01:42:34,970 --> 01:42:46,730
you see that here i i don't cheat

1631
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:49,000
why i it

1632
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:51,980
because believe in this case the

1633
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:57,930
is an average of martingale difference

1634
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:04,640
i took a random variable with the white

1635
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:09,810
my nose is the conditional expectation of piecewise

1636
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:12,040
given the user

1637
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:20,080
the blue average goes zero

1638
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:24,620
second application is in the field of dependence measures

1639
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,220
so some of you

1640
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:33,430
you might have heard of methods methods like ICA and kernel constrained covariance and the

1641
01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:36,000
hilbert schmidt independence criteria

1642
01:43:36,180 --> 01:43:38,350
and all of them treat this problem

1643
01:43:38,370 --> 01:43:40,290
of independence

1644
01:43:40,330 --> 01:43:44,270
so you have two random variables x and y drawn from some joint distribution

1645
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:49,310
pf px y with these marginals and we want to know whether this is a

1646
01:43:49,310 --> 01:43:51,270
joint distribution factorizes

1647
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:55,910
and the main idea in these methods work very well

1648
01:43:55,930 --> 01:43:59,310
it's very very similar to the idea that i showed you before but we are

1649
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:03,620
rewriting distance as an optimisation problem over the unit sphere

1650
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:05,640
the main idea is that

1651
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:11,250
two random variables x and y are independent if and only if for all

1652
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:13,370
continuous functions f g

1653
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:19,330
the covariance of f of x into y vanishes so again this is like it's

1654
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:26,120
a simple linear criterion but it's enforced over a large class of nonlinear functions you

1655
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:29,970
turns out again we we can do this over the unit sphere of a reproducing

1656
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:31,640
kernel hilbert space

1657
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:35,120
and then get independence criteria that will work very well

1658
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:38,000
but and now i want to

1659
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:41,560
show on the shelf would tell you that we can recover

1660
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:45,310
one of these arguments exactly using

1661
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:48,370
the kind of argument that talked about the last ten minutes

1662
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:52,750
and to do this we just have to map the joint distribution into a hilbert

1663
01:44:52,750 --> 01:44:57,350
space we have to map the product of the marginal into it was space

1664
01:44:57,370 --> 01:45:01,390
and then we use this quantity this difference vector or the norm of this difference

1665
01:45:01,390 --> 01:45:03,450
with is a measure of dependence

1666
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:07,140
so we just take heart different all these two distributions

1667
01:45:07,270 --> 01:45:10,290
and if we then use the kernel no we need to come on x and

1668
01:45:10,290 --> 01:45:14,680
y for unicode user can that factorizes into two components

1669
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:16,500
on x y

1670
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:17,930
we can show that

1671
01:45:17,950 --> 01:45:20,870
in this case this quantity

1672
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:25,370
square of this quantity is equal to the so called hilbert schmidt norm of the

1673
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:31,930
covariance operator between the two rkhss it's generalization of forming is known and if we

1674
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:34,290
look at the empirical estimate this quantity

1675
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:36,780
we get this call this thing illustrates

1676
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:40,990
which is exactly the same thing that has been studied before and called the hilbert

1677
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:44,060
schmidt independence criterion

1678
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:48,060
so we arrive at it from a somewhat different point of view

1679
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:52,410
we can also look at the witness function of the equivalent optimisation problem but it

1680
01:45:52,410 --> 01:45:53,850
may not going to that now

1681
01:45:53,870 --> 01:45:55,350
just point out that

1682
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:58,330
there's another talk ICML by shanghai so

1683
01:45:58,350 --> 01:46:07,120
on saturday before lunch uses the conditional cross covariance operator in the context of learning

1684
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:09,120
causal structures for graphical models

1685
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:16,270
so the application is in the field of covariate shift correction and local learning

1686
01:46:16,290 --> 01:46:20,680
in this case this problem of compared to correction

1687
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:25,040
we assume we have the training set drawn from the distribution p

1688
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:29,450
we have tested drawn from different distributions p prime but we assume that the conditional

1689
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:33,310
distributions of y given x identical

1690
01:46:33,330 --> 01:46:39,850
so only the input shift and a number of approaches one of you what i

1691
01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:43,680
have suggested that in such a situation one should reweight with the training set to

1692
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,660
some kind of importance sampling

1693
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:51,600
this could kind of idea also maps well into our framework what we basically we

1694
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,470
do is we

1695
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:53,700
use the mean

1696
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:55,410
one of the test points

1697
01:46:55,430 --> 01:46:58,930
test inputs is all reference and we tried to

1698
01:46:58,930 --> 01:47:03,890
reweight training points with this but i saw twenty points such that the

1699
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:06,970
the re weighted mean of the training points becomes

1700
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,020
similar as possible to the mean of the test points to remember

1701
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:12,270
if the means are the same the statistically

1702
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:15,060
these two distributions are not distinguishable

1703
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:16,290
so we try to

1704
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:20,160
well the training points to mimic the distribution of the test points

1705
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:25,660
and this leads us to an optimisation program to to these constraints of course in

1706
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:32,290
practice we regularize this problem and it turns out that this especially if the situation

1707
01:47:32,290 --> 01:47:37,600
is underspecified for the conduits are too large for the problem this can help a

1708
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:41,700
in the special case where here

1709
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:44,890
this set of test points only contains one test point

1710
01:47:44,990 --> 01:47:46,520
this actually

1711
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:50,620
it's to a local sample weighting schemes as a method for local learning in that

1712
01:47:52,410 --> 01:47:56,560
last application

1713
01:47:57,810 --> 01:48:00,810
again related to the previous one but maybe a little bit more general

1714
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,600
this is something that was only just started

1715
01:48:03,620 --> 01:48:06,950
looking at is in the field of measure estimation

1716
01:48:06,950 --> 01:48:09,970
and as a special case dataset squashing

1717
01:48:09,970 --> 01:48:15,310
there have been some related approaches are there and in this case the idea is

1718
01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:19,660
we try to minimize this discrepancy between the mean of the sample and the mean

1719
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:20,770
of the distribution

1720
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:25,640
when we consider an a priori specified class distributions

1721
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:29,000
so we take this convex combination of distributions

1722
01:48:29,450 --> 01:48:30,540
and with these

1723
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:35,850
constraints and we minimize this quantity and we can rewrite this as a convex quadratic

1724
01:48:36,850 --> 01:48:38,520
with this objective function

1725
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:41,370
but this time is constant

1726
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:44,430
it's interesting to look at these other quantities

1727
01:48:44,450 --> 01:48:47,060
so the difficult ones of these first two

1728
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:54,290
these expectations of the columns with respect to these measures to be pre specified but

1729
01:48:54,290 --> 01:48:57,770
it's interesting to think about what kind of measures what kind of combinations of kernels

1730
01:48:57,770 --> 01:49:02,850
and measures to quantities that can be empirically analytically calculated

1731
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:08,180
in one example is of course if both discussing and this is just an integral

1732
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:10,000
over several gaussians which we can do

1733
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:15,450
so they can be go sense of different with we could also use dirac measures

1734
01:49:15,490 --> 01:49:16,640
the distributions

1735
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:23,490
in which case we can either try to approximate the training set by weighted subset

1736
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:28,660
of the training set this problem as being called dataset squashing before or we can

1737
01:49:28,990 --> 01:49:29,790
try to

1738
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:37,330
we can also recover the covariate shift correction algorithms we try to approximate the true

1739
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:38,410
test set by

1740
01:49:38,830 --> 01:49:43,410
measures on the training points so that i can just talked about before we can

1741
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:44,890
recover that as well

1742
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:46,340
but if they are not

1743
01:49:46,350 --> 01:49:48,740
you're in very good company with people

1744
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:51,560
who also there are

1745
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:53,230
make any sense

1746
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:59,160
so i don't have that prove to be certain it's not mathematically that you know

1747
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:03,640
that's right it has it that's why it's still an open conjecture right and by

1748
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:06,420
the way could show up this could not be so i mean if in fact

1749
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,540
it turns out

1750
01:50:07,590 --> 01:50:12,910
that these are tech are theoretically not part the constant in front end up being

1751
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:16,000
huge or whatever that would also block embarrassment

1752
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:18,270
but it investment spread across a lot of people

1753
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:23,140
OK that's because that's the topic will we'll come back to topic several times in

1754
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:24,090
the class

1755
01:50:25,850 --> 01:50:28,890
OK so

1756
01:50:28,940 --> 01:50:32,400
when you save the methods to solve in general optimisation problem i mean they always

1757
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,090
involve compromise so

1758
01:50:34,130 --> 01:50:34,920
if you

1759
01:50:34,930 --> 01:50:39,420
one is due to the two main categories of compromise are as follows the first

1760
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:43,090
is is is not

1761
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:44,560
back down

1762
01:50:44,570 --> 01:50:46,300
on the meaning of soul

1763
01:50:46,350 --> 01:50:47,660
solve min saw

1764
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:50,370
it means find the point that is

1765
01:50:50,420 --> 01:50:55,270
has least objective and satisfies the constraints that's the definition of salt so you leave

1766
01:50:55,270 --> 01:50:59,410
that intact but you leave open the possibility that the computation time

1767
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:05,070
in might involve let's take thousands of years or something like that OK so that's

1768
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:09,690
generally people call it global optimisation off and it's a big field by the way

1769
01:51:09,690 --> 01:51:14,770
that it's been almost entirely it is based on convex optimization also will see a

1770
01:51:14,770 --> 01:51:18,490
little bit about that later in the class that so that's global optimization

1771
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:21,710
now the other one which is the one most widely done by people who do

1772
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:28,450
they do the following it's actually very very closely collaborate with the do

1773
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:32,610
they go and some the first and have some of the little footnote like this

1774
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:36,690
and then way down to the bottom here like this

1775
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:38,530
the they write this

1776
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:41,920
they they right and now i have to ask you to zoom in on that

1777
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,740
task it is

1778
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:45,170
there go

1779
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:46,150
and there it is

1780
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:50,110
OK so it is not really OK nineteen simbach back out OK so

1781
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:56,050
what that means is that big a big story about this and they make it

1782
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:59,800
they say well it's a local solution but when they don't

1783
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:02,270
it gets tiresome to say

1784
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:07,730
so locally local solution all they can place it doesn't look so as you drop

1785
01:52:07,730 --> 01:52:09,060
it after one

1786
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:12,000
and then you say well i i solved that problem and i solve this problem

1787
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:16,040
the the homework exercise i solve this negotiable give talks they said so i minimize

1788
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:19,150
that the point is they didn't know what they did was they got a local

1789
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:22,310
solution but we will talk more about that as well

1790
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:24,330
OK now there are exceptions

1791
01:52:26,730 --> 01:52:29,670
well that now

1792
01:52:30,590 --> 01:52:32,250
actually if you're going to do that

1793
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:35,350
i would maintain although this is not a

1794
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:37,440
widely held actually you'll find it

1795
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:42,250
many my opinions are not widely known but this is among my opinions are not

1796
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:45,770
widely held this mean one if you're going to do that i would actually do

1797
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:47,920
it via convex optimisation

1798
01:52:47,940 --> 01:52:49,090
and next four

1799
01:52:49,110 --> 01:52:53,730
which is to say actually since we're already like one quarter through around the spring

1800
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:56,230
which probably be giving lectures

1801
01:52:56,270 --> 01:53:03,380
maybe even next week for them to do so i would recommend doing it for

1802
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:06,980
convex optimisation but that's another story they doing it spain

1803
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:12,310
what out now because we crossed the ground it's scheduled to be in the spring

1804
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:14,980
who knows one of doing

1805
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:21,560
i think it could be early february we don't know OK alright

1806
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:28,710
OK so what exceptions there are cases where you can solve these problems no asterisk

1807
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:33,670
nothing most famous one in the world by far the least squares norm

1808
01:53:33,690 --> 01:53:35,360
no asterisks there

1809
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:36,630
it's not like

1810
01:53:36,630 --> 01:53:41,810
oh yeah well i transpose a inverse a transposed you know be aware that

1811
01:53:42,130 --> 01:53:46,580
that's a lot of work super well in practice that it's not the status of

1812
01:53:46,580 --> 01:53:50,380
that is that is the global solution

1813
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,360
and there's a couple others that you might not know about you might though

1814
01:53:55,420 --> 01:54:00,010
and that would be things like linear programming problems will get to those quickly quite

1815
01:54:00,010 --> 01:54:02,960
quickly but those are ones where you you get the answer

1816
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:04,940
you know

1817
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:07,290
asters nothing

1818
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:11,540
there are actually as in these but there are much in much smaller fine print

1819
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:14,080
and i'll get to the later class don't worry i'll

1820
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:17,290
we get when there is an admission that has to be made i will make

1821
01:54:17,290 --> 01:54:18,860
it will come clean

1822
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:23,150
maybe quietly first but one that i will be quite OK

1823
01:54:23,170 --> 01:54:24,750
and in fact

1824
01:54:24,850 --> 01:54:29,870
the parents of these and a considerable generation is convex optimisation problem so this is

1825
01:54:29,870 --> 01:54:32,080
really sort of the exception

1826
01:54:32,250 --> 01:54:36,170
so a lot you know i mean this to a rough the rough idea to

1827
01:54:36,170 --> 01:54:39,190
put it all together something like this

1828
01:54:39,210 --> 01:54:43,210
that most opposition once you get so let's let's review what we've learned so far

1829
01:54:43,230 --> 01:54:47,400
we have really going to let review went so far a everything is an optimisation

1830
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:50,020
problem OK well that's tautology OK

1831
01:54:50,610 --> 01:54:54,830
we can really you can't really solve most opposition all you really can't solve cases

1832
01:54:54,830 --> 01:54:55,960
so far

1833
01:54:55,980 --> 01:55:00,710
great that's the kind of depressing now the good news is actually here that there

1834
01:55:00,710 --> 01:55:05,090
are huge exceptions this entire classes about one of the exceptions

1835
01:55:06,130 --> 01:55:07,830
when you do convex optimization

1836
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:11,380
there are no asterisks it's you you solve the problem in

1837
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:13,540
there are no apologies nothing

1838
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:15,190
it's the global solution

1839
01:55:15,230 --> 01:55:16,130
which is fine

1840
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:18,790
is convex

1841
01:55:18,810 --> 01:55:24,520
his life convex i would have to say no it's not i hope it's not

1842
01:55:24,610 --> 01:55:29,500
more you know it's not said no no as well if we get later today

1843
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:31,400
on the white

1844
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:35,730
we don't really what i mean to czech convexity you really have to take two

1845
01:55:35,730 --> 01:55:40,020
instances and then form average weighted averages in between like for example the average of

1846
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:41,210
two things

1847
01:55:41,230 --> 01:55:45,150
would you i would be the average of yours in your life look like i

1848
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:50,170
don't know what the hell the thing that has happened is that life has to

1849
01:55:50,170 --> 01:55:53,130
be better than the average of the qualities of your lives

1850
01:55:54,940 --> 01:55:56,190
i don't

1851
01:55:56,210 --> 01:56:06,790
keep that is running topic will revisit periodic but for the most like this is

1852
01:56:06,790 --> 01:56:12,670
it's not a question there are exceptions besides convex optimisation nesterov

1853
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,290
one right now

1854
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:16,710
sure you're writing composition

1855
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:20,480
that's that's one where

1856
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:25,360
you can compute the singular as i could i can write as an optimisation problem

1857
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:29,230
or something like that pretty easily write in for example a right in right this

1858
01:56:29,230 --> 01:56:33,610
work they find me the best rank two approximation matrix

1859
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:36,830
non convex

1860
01:56:37,540 --> 01:56:38,730
non convex

1861
01:56:38,750 --> 01:56:42,860
and yet we can solve it and we get the exact global solution end of

1862
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:48,290
story by singular values or by a principal components analysis depending on what future

1863
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:49,940
so that's an example

1864
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:55,330
that's pretty much about it now there are some others that there is that there's

1865
01:56:55,330 --> 01:56:57,880
no i mean there are some combinatorial problems

1866
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:01,880
so taking things on combinatorial algorithms in computer science or something like that

1867
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:04,610
they are common to all country problems

1868
01:57:04,610 --> 01:57:07,520
is that we say that given the class

1869
01:57:07,530 --> 01:57:13,010
then the each of the component if is independent of the other so that the

1870
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:15,340
different measurement i see about nine

1871
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:17,970
my input are independent

1872
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:19,120
from each other

1873
01:57:19,180 --> 01:57:24,610
and so it's represented uganda presented namespace by this graph which

1874
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:27,560
you have observed

1875
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:29,260
the the

1876
01:57:29,260 --> 01:57:32,540
the different measure of your examples

1877
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,980
and q you have the class

1878
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:36,220
and so on

1879
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:37,770
we see that

1880
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:42,500
in going back to lower dispersion problem

1881
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:46,030
is a is is the tate to tate

1882
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:47,600
no note

1883
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:48,840
and this

1884
01:57:51,490 --> 01:57:54,180
seeing it if i find the class

1885
01:57:54,210 --> 01:57:56,030
like if a conditioned on the class

1886
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:01,930
any of the of the components are independent

1887
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:03,420
which makes that we can

1888
01:58:03,450 --> 01:58:05,450
right this as the product

1889
01:58:05,470 --> 01:58:07,800
over the continent

1890
01:58:08,270 --> 01:58:12,250
the of of the probability of the component given the class

1891
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:14,130
OK another example that you know

1892
01:58:14,150 --> 01:58:16,450
it is the first order

1893
01:58:16,730 --> 01:58:18,660
markov model

1894
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:19,520
in which

1895
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:21,430
we have

1896
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:26,040
twenty which in fact it's a way of

1897
01:58:26,110 --> 01:58:29,660
writing the sequence short away

1898
01:58:29,930 --> 01:58:32,550
sequence from one to t

1899
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:35,960
what is a random

1900
01:58:35,970 --> 01:58:39,120
michael's mothers our our

1901
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:43,650
mothers to represent sequence of of states

1902
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:45,730
and so it can be

1903
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:47,910
written like that you have

1904
01:58:49,180 --> 01:58:50,260
the first

1905
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:52,830
the first element in my sequence

1906
01:58:52,850 --> 01:58:55,070
and so on the table

1907
01:58:55,090 --> 01:58:59,260
t minus one elements and may may sequence and the

1908
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:00,850
the last element sequence

1909
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:05,010
and what is usually the first order markov assumption

1910
01:59:05,030 --> 01:59:05,850
is that

1911
01:59:05,870 --> 01:59:07,320
the probability of

1912
01:59:07,330 --> 01:59:14,260
one one element in the sequence is only dependent on the previous

1913
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:18,420
the previous one and not on the the once before so that can do it

1914
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:23,910
like that the probability of the state t

1915
01:59:23,930 --> 01:59:25,880
is given

1916
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:31,390
the all the previous states inside equal to its equal to the probability of

1917
01:59:31,970 --> 01:59:33,520
the state t

1918
01:59:33,530 --> 01:59:35,120
given the

1919
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:36,760
previous state

1920
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:43,760
and you see that that was the model is the first

1921
01:59:43,770 --> 01:59:47,730
so the graphical model is is the first graph i show you with the which

1922
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:50,500
any any not in here

1923
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:56,120
apart from may be the first and the last hour head to tail

1924
01:59:56,830 --> 01:59:57,820
i had to

1925
01:59:57,830 --> 02:00:01,090
note so observing one conditioning one

1926
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:03,560
we give

1927
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:10,850
he some considered to tree consequent if states

1928
02:00:11,850 --> 02:00:19,700
and i observe one of the middle then the tools will be conditionally independent

1929
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:25,580
and this can be generalised instead of having sequences i have liked

1930
02:00:26,070 --> 02:00:29,330
the two dimensional sequences

1931
02:00:29,390 --> 02:00:31,840
the like a map of

1932
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:33,670
of states

1933
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:38,040
this here is something more general

1934
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:42,120
say that i have a joint distribution

1935
02:00:42,130 --> 02:00:47,170
represented by a directed graphical models

1936
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:53,930
then if i take the conditional distribution of parts plant explaining my

1937
02:00:54,010 --> 02:00:56,460
may set of of random variables

1938
02:00:57,240 --> 02:01:00,040
so i am we consider that

1939
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:03,100
conditional distrib distribution of

1940
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:07,100
one particular not given all the remained in meaning

1941
02:01:09,370 --> 02:01:12,530
and so that can be written by a

1942
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:17,050
bayes as the probe the joint probability

1943
02:01:17,050 --> 02:01:21,730
thank the marginalisation divided by the demand marginalization

1944
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:27,880
and since

1945
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:33,350
we know that this is represented by a directed graph so we know that we

1946
02:01:33,350 --> 02:01:35,770
can order the nodes in a way that

1947
02:01:37,630 --> 02:01:41,320
are any parent has lower degree

1948
02:01:41,340 --> 02:01:45,680
or lower numbering than any of his of his children

1949
02:01:45,810 --> 02:01:46,590
i can

1950
02:01:46,620 --> 02:01:50,970
decompose the joint probability as the product

1951
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:53,470
of the probability of

1952
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:55,360
it's not giving experience

1953
02:01:56,920 --> 02:01:58,710
and so here in the in the

1954
02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:02,520
a lot of of of

1955
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:03,790
properties here

1956
02:02:03,790 --> 02:02:07,890
what will not depend on yx yx

1957
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:14,520
thanks i and so they will go out of the the of the integral

1958
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:16,870
and we'll council was it was the

1959
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:18,840
top one

1960
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:20,820
and so

1961
02:02:20,870 --> 02:02:22,950
this will only depend

1962
02:02:22,950 --> 02:02:25,350
on a few set of nodes
