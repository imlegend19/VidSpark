1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,770
the columns of the matrix would be an identical

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,180
plates but which would be orthogonal

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,890
you know ninety degrees aligned was the first one so you have these rules you

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,640
know here and is here

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,990
and this would be the inputs and this would be the outputs and you could

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,830
exemplify what is this learning like you know in this in the hands will simplified

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,700
visual style

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,940
well you have an association between input

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:39,090
rho and an output column if there is a hole drilled

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,810
that creates the communication between the first plateau in the second flight sick this could

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,500
be hydraulic model of plasticity of memory now if you have an input you can

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,280
just put a little bit of water in one of the rules and it goes

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,310
in fields

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,620
you know the rules and groups

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:04,700
into the commons you can collect into the core this time and and you will

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,180
get your output runs

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:13,280
OK so so i'm hoping people will have other ideas of that kind and i

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,540
was inspired by some of the kids that people made and that they saw the

19
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,000
lawrence hall of science which is very close to where i live

20
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,630
and you can now buy you know for between ten and twenty dollars a teacher

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,010
for four kids where you can make experiments on your kitchen counter

22
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:38,220
in electromagnetism in chemistry and mechanics and all the elements that that you need to

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,910
do the experiments you can find you know in in your kitchen essentially

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,180
so i was thinking well one do that for learning as well we can have

25
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:55,150
the simple experiments that illustrate with very concrete objects what it is to to learn

26
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:01,980
and in the process of doing that actually i think it will make us also

27
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:08,110
reflect on what would you know the very basic principles that matter for

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,330
for science

29
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:18,440
so i would like to to state this effort and and slowly build it up

30
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,120
i think there is opportunity for us to write more wikipedia articles

31
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:31,500
because wikipedia is a great vehicle for the for the broad public the opportunities to

32
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,900
the amount of the volume of documentation that there is in the past calendar website

33
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,050
and also i think make the pascal website more visible so people should know about

34
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,220
its should know that there is material here for example i didn't know myself that

35
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,970
there were all these videos that were available so people should be downloading it from

36
00:02:51,970 --> 00:03:00,270
from the outside and it would be great if people you know which started making

37
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:07,780
games and interactive software that is that this pedagogical and vision that we can have

38
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,040
a website that would link to all these different resources

39
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,510
and then i talked about in the kitchen counter demos for children and adults

40
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:27,240
and more sophisticated demonstrations that could be then presented in science museums or in or

41
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:34,020
in schools and could be then part of teaching curricula as well

42
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:41,570
so it is my attempt as a two proposing a number of themes around which

43
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,920
we can we group

44
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,360
four different types of research

45
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,090
i'm thinking of two poles

46
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:54,350
so the top call has to do about learning

47
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,970
as a means of helping survival

48
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,350
so why do we need to learn as much as

49
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,760
physical entities or humans as animals why do we need to we need to learn

50
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,180
to survive two

51
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:15,800
to improve or quality of life and live and so on the second goal of

52
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,640
learning i think is creation so level is against the basic thing that need to

53
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,570
do first and then afterwards you have some spare time and you have you know

54
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,030
succeeded in surviving qx brain energy

55
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,710
you can spend it on on creation

56
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,010
and to create things you also need to learn from your peers so if you're

57
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,820
an artist you you will learn from the past artists you know and if you

58
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,880
are a researcher who learn from past researchers to make new creations

59
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,510
so those two poles

60
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,020
for me would be fueled by a certain number

61
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,010
a fundamental building blocks so the

62
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:05,240
intention survival and creation of the applications and what the red

63
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:13,080
blocks here are the the material that that you need in order to

64
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,310
tell you

65
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,180
well might have revealed that the very start

66
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,470
it's really laughs

67
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,810
the reconstruction was saying the

68
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,220
this is really

69
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,830
function and the way

70
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,850
really this series

71
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,260
i'm sorry that really late

72
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,280
you sort of sort

73
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,220
why it's true

74
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,220
it's the ages

75
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,780
to find the coefficients

76
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,310
and the as put everything back together

77
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,310
so all

78
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,830
is a scaling function

79
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,660
so the full picture is

80
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,510
OK i this

81
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,160
link function is usually written detailed views of features

82
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,220
and the way that use the word w told uses h ones

83
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,060
but those are

84
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,470
those are in this step of finding coefficients

85
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,120
so you don't really see them

86
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,850
and in the reconstruction CS

87
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,600
the discrete time

88
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,870
here w

89
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,370
right so

90
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,640
very good if i rewrite full filter bank

91
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,510
the signal goes through

92
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,530
each zero and h one

93
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,780
now if transformed

94
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,930
we compress

95
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,970
inverse transform upset fall

96
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,410
the other filters

97
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,470
after one of the pieces together

98
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,810
and you

99
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,560
reconstruct x

100
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,620
just writing what we

101
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,370
we're looking at last week

102
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,140
so the whole point is

103
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,490
it is

104
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,720
these numbers

105
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,490
the filters

106
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,890
are by very same numbers

107
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,680
go into

108
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,950
continuous time

109
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,720
these numbers

110
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,180
changing faces

111
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,280
the coefficients in new basis

112
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,350
continuous time these are the spaces

113
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,560
and she said w given the bases

114
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,030
the coefficients

115
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,080
it connects everything still

116
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,140
they don't wish repeat don't wish

117
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,010
magic numbers because she was the first to five

118
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,720
numbers that work

119
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,410
just what

120
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,510
the numbers were

121
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,850
one plus

122
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,580
three bus route three

123
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,290
three miles three three one nine three three were

124
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,830
it's not enough one is the flip

125
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,390
i guess is

126
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,760
and that's where we are going to the trouble fly

127
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,240
h one n one

128
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,490
so those

129
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,530
one is the

130
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,290
the same four numbers here

131
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,330
because it over she was shooting for cycle

132
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,180
she uses the same four numbers but

133
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:33,370
signed first

134
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,510
by reversing every other signs i do get a high pass filter

135
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:44,140
and this guy is orthogonal to that guy

136
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,180
the result of orthogonality of vectors is orthogonality

137
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,780
we it's

138
00:09:53,830 --> 00:10:00,780
that was it it you might read the original paper by don't wish

139
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,810
i field

140
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,060
thank you

141
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,950
communications on

142
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,780
you're an applied math

143
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,990
when applied it's york university courant institute journal

144
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,260
it's just

145
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,450
very striking paper for the amount of

146
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,990
inside brought the progress is made on the problem

147
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:38,240
extremely tough to go back to the second problem was to find the basis

148
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,760
that was orthogonal

149
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,700
this is the distinction

150
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,310
because of course

151
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,650
and as you might

152
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,650
that is

153
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,280
is what you are

154
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,680
course you are

155
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,890
i find it was on its back right

156
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,760
and on top of

157
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,650
so we should i

158
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,770
the those

159
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,730
you my

160
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,600
this is far

161
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,760
and the sense of from the

162
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,380
the change was in between two rules

163
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,230
and which was the gap between men

164
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,490
as you will that right now

165
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:03,480
this is really do need to what's just

166
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,030
so many wrong is not from the perspective so so

167
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,220
the BBC's you all

168
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,430
and he is

169
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,880
peace now runs in a game

170
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,740
the sense of

171
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,710
is a

172
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,790
one of the simplest kind

173
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,550
so this is

174
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,650
this is

175
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,490
so this is my computer

176
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,950
they're lying

177
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,320
rule also states that this

178
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,490
random or nine lots of space

179
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,800
yeah i see through his

180
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,450
it is that it is

181
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,580
what are these procedures

182
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,640
for was

183
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,900
i don't know that

184
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,120
some problems of my master at low robots

185
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,010
and it doesn't matter to me

186
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:16,730
these are the the role

187
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,260
and now for you

188
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,960
the the business

189
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,200
that comes rules one

190
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,790
now that the main thing is to find

191
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,750
it's not

192
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,070
i see no

193
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,120
which is the

194
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,050
there's an image

195
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,730
now again from most

196
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:02,320
i find hard to read i see no

197
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,140
that means this is that

198
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,590
so in two dimensions because it is

199
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,990
one reason is this

200
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,320
it just means there

201
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,470
so this is how it works so in two dimensions

202
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,010
here this

203
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,510
large the rules inside this

204
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,330
and the amazing assumptions in this tutorial

205
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,340
and this

206
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,130
i thought that the name

207
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,960
this is a

208
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,990
so you see what i mean

209
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,220
one is

210
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,960
i i was too

211
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,190
of e

212
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,890
dot elves dot product

213
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,790
so the line integral

214
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,140
equals minus the

215
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,240
and this is a magnetic flux

216
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,050
through road surface

217
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,790
that you test

218
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,090
two that closed loop it is an open service

219
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,930
any surface

220
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,280
you may choose is fine

221
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,540
it is an open service i cannot

222
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,900
stress that enough

223
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,890
you choose a closed loop

224
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,060
you can do it right here in space

225
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,550
you can attest to that an open service which could bones out into the audience

226
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,310
any moment in time

227
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,270
this the whole

228
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,520
so whenever you deal with

229
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,690
the line integrals

230
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,820
so let's do

231
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,060
the line integral

232
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,400
and then see what that

233
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,440
boundary condition that leads to

234
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,290
so we do the same thing with their

235
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,690
so we have here conductor

236
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,920
and here we have a vacuum

237
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,280
and so he field here

238
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,050
everywhere zero

239
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,030
here is your electric field vector coming in

240
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,490
from your electromagnetic wave

241
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,490
so here is your e t

242
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,210
here is your and

243
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,720
exactly in the way

244
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:35,110
that i find this is the normal component to serve

245
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,460
now i'm going to make a closed loop

246
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,810
this is my closed loop

247
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,360
from surprise you

248
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,710
that i choose it this way

249
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,220
and i'm going to march around the closed loop in any direction that i want

250
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,840
to i chose this direction makes no difference which direction

251
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,060
you choose

252
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,870
that this be dl

253
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,280
and that this

254
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,970
the db

255
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,210
i'm going to do exactly the same thing

256
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,070
i'm going to go in the limiting case when dl goes to zero so they

257
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,590
get the boundary condition

258
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,520
at the

259
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,580
so if you're ready for this i start here

260
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:19,910
and i move in this direction so the EU the UFT has no impact because

261
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:24,190
it's perpendicular to the direction of motion so the dot product is zero so all

262
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,950
i worry about is this one

263
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,730
and so i get one half could e of and

264
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,790
and one half

265
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,820
one of the l let's suppose that this is one half of the l and

266
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,940
this is one

267
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,690
but that's when i go from here to here

268
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,570
so now we go from here to here

269
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,060
and of course you've and has no effect because it's perpendicular to dl

270
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,890
l is a vector in the direction that i'm moving

271
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,230
so now i only deal with u of t

272
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,190
now we get plus

273
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,960
he of t

274
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,740
times the

275
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,240
now i mean i go down

276
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,060
so now you have to use up i go down to the dot product creates

277
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,350
a minus sign

278
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,730
so now we get

279
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,200
one of

280
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,570
and so on

281
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,310
l a set u of t but diamond you've you've and is in this direction

282
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,110
and you're moving in this direction

283
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,840
so that's why you get a minus sign and you've has no effect

284
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,690
because is perpendicular to the wind direction of motion and the electric field here is

285
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,150
so this now

286
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,660
becomes minus

287
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,650
chains of the

288
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,340
magnetic flux through

289
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,530
that surface

290
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,410
this surface if you wish or surface boulders out in the audience i don't care

291
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,530
it is minus

292
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,830
the phi

293
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,020
and that

294
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,690
goes to zero

295
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,390
because i'm going to make the non-zero so there is no surface left

296
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,420
so that one goes to zero

297
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,390
notice that this one

298
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,540
councils of again this one

299
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,120
so now we find

300
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,740
that is that at the boundary condition

301
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,070
and gential

302
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,580
but that's the one

303
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,690
i want to remind you though that is the skin depth

304
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,960
so in reality

305
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,070
there's an exponential decay

306
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
all of this

307
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,720
e vector

308
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,900
that is in the service that decays exponentially over that

309
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,570
the skin depth delta that we discussed earlier

310
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:38,240
that is that skin

311
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,070
so that is the kernel of b

312
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,280
which is your two

313
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,420
so you're going to do a closed loop integrals

314
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,840
of these ltl you work your way through that

315
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,410
and then you will find

316
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,320
the magnitude

317
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,840
of b of t

318
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,670
that is the

319
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,160
component of the magnetic field in the plane of the conductor attentional component

320
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,570
that magnitude

321
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,120
his museo

322
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,040
what we call

323
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,220
of s is the surface

324
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,290
current density and it has units and p is the leader

325
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,410
and so

326
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,450
i actually currents

327
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,440
oscillatory currents

328
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,320
on the surface

329
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,200
that occur when the electromagnetic wave comes in these currents change with the frequency of

330
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,120
course of incident radiation

331
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,540
so not only

332
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,120
is there all the time

333
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,700
readjustment of rove s which is the surface

334
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,960
charge density

335
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,940
but all the time is that electromagnetic wave interacts with the conductor

336
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
it's going to be a current

337
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,700
in order to make sure

338
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,830
that we need

339
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:04,080
this boundary condition so real things are really happening

340
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,760
so we can use these four boundary conditions now

341
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,550
you start looking into some

342
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,160
results and i will start with a very simple example

343
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,360
because i can demonstrate that

344
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,880
and you can delete leaving sorry this is not actually very yesterday for example you

345
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,200
can believe that

346
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,720
when you add more and more of adding more and more by grams to to

347
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,420
a model

348
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,200
entropy of models so number amount of information in the model

349
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,210
and field

350
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,420
increases pretty fast

351
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,730
every new piece of information is important this information talking about

352
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,820
frequent word of frequent viagra

353
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,080
but then

354
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,470
you can see that number of information usually

355
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,440
increases very very slow

356
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,530
and i think that you have this intuition

357
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,210
that's only

358
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,720
some small number of war

359
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:12,740
i have some strange distributions that whereas with a very free

360
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,680
all the roads and all other combinations of words are pretty random and they uniformly

361
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,620
how we can do this

362
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:27,390
imagine that we have not only unigram model not on the distribution of earth to

363
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,970
but also

364
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,810
higher order models

365
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,050
viagra model trying to model

366
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,860
so we can use

367
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,470
simpler model

368
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,630
models of low order

369
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,630
next models

370
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:52,480
imagine that you have this stuff you know they are going to use this model

371
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:57,400
in our system and we don't want to create huge files and some complex social

372
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,310
structures were loaded something into memory

373
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,210
going to seed for example model

374
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,240
three gram model of the whole english language

375
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,360
into memory of all ordinary computer

376
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,150
more than that because it's not the main task of all search engine we only

377
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,150
suggesting result

378
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,270
maybe we can feed it in the number of megabytes in our memory

379
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,660
what do we want to

380
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,130
we can create

381
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,740
our model

382
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,350
for example from unigram model three grandmother

383
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,620
then we can assume that we have some

384
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,680
algorithm that can calculate

385
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,470
probability for high order model

386
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,510
using results from

387
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,710
three this order models

388
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,480
using this algorithm are called usually such

389
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,960
collection is called the coffin in the english one

390
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,490
and then we can come up with

391
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,920
OK to have this information from all higher order models

392
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:13,800
and they have the same probability but calculated using low order models

393
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,390
and become quite them and if you see that we already had

394
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,880
i have pretty good

395
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,860
the difference in this really is lower than some threshold

396
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,240
we can simply remove

397
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,410
this from higher order models

398
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,600
and then we can do it interracial so we can

399
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,930
starting from from for example

400
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,710
the higher order model because of the highest order model in this is the biggest

401
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,560
i understand that for example we have much more power so worse than simple words

402
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,170
and three grounds is much more than viagra

403
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,410
so we can

404
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,350
stop pruning from the highest order

405
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:02,890
and do it in iteration always control precision of all

406
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,330
and removed

407
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:10,680
this probability that can be predicted by another information

408
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,720
how can we use

409
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,970
low order model to predict probability of higher order demand

410
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,810
consider this

411
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:27,470
simplest around have unigram model and they have environment

412
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,770
so you have probability for word one word two

413
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,540
this is a slide

414
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,310
then we can

415
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,350
of black

416
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,680
simply using ordinary formula of

417
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,310
probabilities of conditional probabilities

418
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,970
but we have

419
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,000
this so

420
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,500
the probability of just war we have

421
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:57,250
they don't have combine probability from the above

422
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,130
combining probability about two

423
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,960
but what we can do can

424
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,060
i have

425
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,880
independent assumptions

426
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,640
you can think OK

427
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,660
this more completely independent

428
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,880
if there are completely independent

429
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,850
the quran is simply

430
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,080
play of

431
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,610
case we can we can use it

432
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:28,880
this human behaviour would entail and just briefly go through this spatial reasoning is of

433
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,820
interest having the memory i mean making mistakes not not too often i think twice

434
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:40,200
is OK but three four five times becomes a bit tedious commonsense reasoning using goals

435
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,410
in what you do

436
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:49,610
possibly some gold using tactics planning in team games communicating with each other coordinating what

437
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:55,740
you do adapting if you see that what you do doesn't work to change and

438
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:02,070
these are in the way the most interesting ones human behavior sometimes pretty unpredictable ways

439
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:07,720
but often interesting ways and they have errors and weaknesses they make errors and have

440
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,880
weaknesses but these have to be again not running into one weaknesses right you want

441
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,050
exploitability weaknesses

442
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,630
and interesting weaknesses and then if you explain them three times you want to that

443
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,780
have to be closed right because the funders in finding another weakness that you could

444
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:35,930
so here's an example of that that is actually being done in commercial games

445
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:41,510
the idea is to control a car on the track and the first goal is

446
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:51,220
to have a to follow a certain line on the course in in a believable

447
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:58,880
and also handle interaction like recovering when you happen to bump into the wall or

448
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,340
or a handle interaction in the sense of overtaking people

449
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:08,950
the other thing that people then i thought about was wouldn't it be great if

450
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,070
the car if we could emulate the driving style of particular driver so if you

451
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,930
were playing the game and you would have to go to the toilet you could

452
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:22,450
just switch on your substitute driver you driver as it's called and that

453
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,220
guy would then go on there there were others there are other ideas like you

454
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,490
train up your driver ta and he plays online tournaments against other drivers and so

455
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:35,590
you have to play in tournaments director your more like the culture of of the

456
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,820
so the example two examples in which this has actually been carried out when is

457
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,610
colin macrae rally

458
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:50,700
and there neural networks were used to to learn how to negotiate track but directly

459
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,150
of course it's relatively simple in the sense that there was little interaction between the

460
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,030
cars in this game is about negotiating a given track in

461
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,300
as short time period as possible and

462
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,530
but the i was using neural networks and that that seems to work quite well

463
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,820
another example is forza motorsports that's some colleagues of mine a working on that and

464
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,860
it's going to be released for the x-box in a couple of months and this

465
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,450
is where these driving this driver technology is being used so one of the features

466
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:27,180
is that you can actually drive the car for a few tracks and then the

467
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:34,840
computer learns your particular choice of of a of the line for the track

468
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,360
so the idea is quite simple i don't want to go into the details here

469
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,110
what you you need to player in the game for learning you have this avatar

470
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:51,200
that you want to train and you use the learning algorithm and the game state

471
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,680
is sent to the player and the avatar and the learning algorithm

472
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,680
the player then behave in certain ways and

473
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,880
the learning algorithm and the game of course get this information and the avatar behave

474
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,170
in certain ways

475
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,720
and then the learning algorithm can give feedback

476
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:16,180
depending on the discrepancy between the behaviour of the avatar and the behaviour of human

477
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:21,610
and that's the learning process so this is example

478
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:28,510
this is an example of a of the racing line here on a given track

479
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,130
the blue thing is the racing line and

480
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:38,070
this is rolled try ralf herbrich my colleague trying to follow the racing line as

481
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,200
precisely as possible

482
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,320
later i he was tired i guess

483
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,700
that's essentially the training data

484
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,210
these young people in the audience you should know

485
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,660
uh and all this additional information so that's high dimensional data as well

486
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,780
another area i work is computational biology gene expression

487
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,370
so you can characterize the state of the cell

488
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:11,080
effectively be concentration and location of all the chemical compounds that are in so i

489
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,700
think the size of the state space

490
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,560
u have i don't know if my memory is something like thirty thousand genes in

491
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,890
your body eta those genes has products

492
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,970
maybe in the form of proteins many many more proteins and the are genes

493
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,610
so if we think of the state of an individual wanted yourselves

494
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,950
u need not millions

495
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:35,330
variables that characterize the state at any given time plus position

496
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,430
velocity everything very

497
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,440
very very high dimensional

498
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:48,890
how do we deal with complex data so i tried to simulate some complex data

499
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:53,790
and this is very much starting from what goes on in a low dimensional because

500
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:57,870
typically people don't show you images of high dimensional data because you can't visualize it

501
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,680
so when i first started doing machine learning it

502
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,840
u looked data like this it looks complicated but people had techniques for dealing with

503
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,160
this they had mixtures of gaussians models and hear with the so called located in

504
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,780
the center and a little ellipsoid

505
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,450
denoting um

506
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,510
thee covariance if the

507
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,900
you've got a mixture of gaussians bit about data which think that's really good because um

508
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,880
now looks quite complex in terms of data and density modeling is something we want to do

509
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,140
understand the density of the data and i tell you is actually perfect because it's

510
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,290
these model i generated the data from so this is even if it from the

511
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,510
data this is the true model

512
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,140
once you've seen use anything

513
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:47,720
complex structure isn't a problem for mixtures galcians yeah i mean it can model these

514
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,690
things quite well people do a lot of effort into selecting the number components into

515
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,170
dealing with the fact that there is

516
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,300
multiple local minima

517
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:59,240
but fundamentally surely that's the problem solved

518
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,000
that's not the case and it's not the case i'd argue because the way you

519
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,010
look at data in two dimensions is somehow so the wrong and the galaxy and

520
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,160
maybe a nice model in two dimensions but straightforward calcium

521
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,050
calcium where you're not thinking about what you're doing

522
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,020
so if you just apply calcium and that its covariance in high dimensions it's gonna

523
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,740
be quite a bad model very often

524
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,230
i still argue the gaussians can be very useful you can do a range of things gaussians but

525
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,510
you have to do things like structure the covariance matrix

526
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,810
in order to fit them

527
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,940
why is it you know this is the sort of thing that

528
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:41,370
i came into machine learning from a fairly naive perspective that in those days machine

529
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:45,020
learning this was about how the brain works and neural networks is how the brain

530
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,660
works and these bunch people came along with support vector machines and messed it all

531
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:54,920
finally with deep learning going back to doing what we were doing fifteen years ago back to

532
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,520
these are the drawing these circles and putting lines between them

533
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:03,980
on and i came in from mechanical engineering background with the naive view that neural

534
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,150
networks is where it's at and then when i saw these statistical models mixture of

535
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,340
gaussians i thought well surely they're very powerful to

536
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,050
but i think the reason that they aren't as widely used as they should be

537
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,850
is because in high dimensional data they typically don't work very well

538
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,980
these two-dimensional parts against can be misleading and a low dimensional intuitions can fail

539
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,760
dramatically and there's a couple major issues

540
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,680
in high dimensions in a guassian density all data actually moves to a shell

541
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,320
now i'm gonna try and show you visualize what i mean by moving to a

542
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,540
shell you may have heard this before

543
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,080
there is no data near the mean of the gaussians so

544
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,540
way of thinking about clustering model like this is what you're saying about your data

545
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,430
and i like this way of thinking about it is that each data point is

546
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,800
really a prototype that's the mean the calcium

547
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,780
has then been corrupted in some way according to the covariance calcium so you're saying

548
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,800
you represent your data by prototypes that the mean

549
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,710
plus corruption which is the covariance how they move away from the mean

550
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,880
sometimes you don't show this thing

551
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,970
what what what moves

552
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:18,080
so for this from a patient you have an ordering

553
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,790
i have an ordering

554
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,520
of items

555
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:30,280
it's called full full full ranking

556
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,920
so in this let's two

557
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,070
it's called for ranking because all of these orders meaningful

558
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,760
and this bar he is

559
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,760
it tells you that you prefer the heat and item

560
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,920
on the left

561
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,760
of it

562
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,760
so this year this thing here

563
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,040
is what i wrote in blue

564
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,930
you know this permutation leads to

565
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,510
it's this

566
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,510
or this for ranking the order of the

567
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,850
but i would say that

568
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,190
i do this

569
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:27,050
the set of items

570
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,010
no large

571
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,970
and large here means

572
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,680
maybe anything larger than

573
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,470
anything larger than thirty is because you know the number of possible

574
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,470
permutation with the

575
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,730
and this is quite

576
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,250
to deal with

577
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,120
so that comes this

578
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:53,900
this idea of partial rankings

579
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,160
you know of talk about core sets

580
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:08,630
so how you how you make partial rankings

581
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,380
you take this presentation

582
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,200
then you multiply

583
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,780
by a subgroup

584
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,520
this subgroup while

585
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,350
i will

586
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:26,200
use the following notation here

587
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,980
this means that

588
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,660
this subgroup

589
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,510
the first two numbers

590
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,880
and the last one

591
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,440
it's a

592
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,280
you don't care

593
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:46,150
so all elements that fixed the first two numbers

594
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,590
good you take those elements for this approach

595
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,700
and they all did

596
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,070
the are that's that

597
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,240
the order the ordering of the the

598
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,540
two numbers can

599
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,380
can move fixed and

600
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,450
doesn't matter

601
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,520
so this

602
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,860
this this will create the following

603
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,770
all agree

604
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,790
this gives you an ordering

605
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,600
permutation pi

606
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,740
this is an

607
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,440
normally used

608
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,310
notation for politicians

609
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,650
partition one one two

610
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,570
you know the sum of this thing has to be the order of the group

611
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,790
and in this case for

612
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,170
we have to construct the first and show you

613
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:15,050
first of all which are the elements elements of these

614
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,160
of the subgroup here

615
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,590
certainly the identities here

616
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,540
because the identity

617
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:28,180
the identity

618
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,260
with which fix everybody

619
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,490
one is

620
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:50,320
that's that's we use here not this notation look i'm not using various appliances

621
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,560
i'm only using the the

622
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,760
resulting order of the

623
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,700
permutation so this is the identity

624
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,570
one two three four

625
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:05,520
and this is one from of limitation that fix

626
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:10,110
the first two numbers

627
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,480
look less and less like the underlying distribution

628
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,090
in this case you started off good but as time goes on you might get

629
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:20,650
example but it is simply concentrated near the boundary

630
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:26,090
and so you know how some labels later what you're left with is a training

631
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,890
set looks very unlike the underlying distribution

632
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:35,060
and so now the question is do we really want to optimize with respect to

633
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,430
this training set

634
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,700
it's very different from the distribution we actually care about who knows maybe by being

635
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:46,400
close maybe the point right near the boundary are actually noisy points and we don't

636
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,880
want to pay all that much attention to their labels

637
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:55,600
OK but simon says that many ways in which to sort of summarize what the

638
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,350
issue is

639
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,140
the simplest way to say this

640
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,080
is that it's the problem of biased sampling

641
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,050
OK that you

642
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:09,750
as time goes on your training set looks very different from the distribution you actually

643
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:16,200
care about and so there is some danger in optimizing with respect to the training

644
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,850
so by the way feel free to stop me at any time

645
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,060
any questions

646
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,550
this is the nature of the activity

647
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,580
this choose

648
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,650
you are

649
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:38,520
yeah it but it seems like this one does want to choose informative points and

650
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,930
yet at the same time one wants the resulting classifier to do well with respect

651
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,710
to random looking points

652
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,980
so it looks like this is going to be some sort of trade-off or there's

653
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,530
some source of conflict of the here and so the question is how does one

654
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:56,380
resolve this conflict and

655
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,930
so that's the sort of thing that will be talking about

656
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,440
so concerned about bias

657
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:09,260
on the distribution of the four themselves

658
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,040
one of the finest

659
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,890
the control labels given one

660
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,640
as you can see the

661
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:23,020
no so so they they bought the right to be able to source confirms the

662
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,560
second would be a source of concern

663
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,110
right so it's so so the two

664
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:27,800
the two

665
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:33,500
the two problems the first is that the the distribution of the x values is

666
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,570
not nature's distribution of the x values and the second is the distribution of y

667
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:43,110
given x might be different you know you might be by focusing on the boundary

668
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,930
you might essentially be in regime where the distribution of y given x is something

669
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:53,630
like point five always and so those labels might be less reliable

670
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:59,820
so this this is sort of at a high level and a little bit you

671
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:05,130
know touchy-feely this whole issue of sampling bias so just to make it more concrete

672
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,270
let's look at a specific example

673
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:12,320
OK so here is the sort of generic strategy that i talked about and i

674
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,930
said that the variance of it but i was just looking at the kind of

675
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,900
a high level

676
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:21,050
OK and now suppose that you know just to just to keep things simple suppose

677
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:25,710
we have a really easy hypothesis class OK so the data all lie on the

678
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:30,300
line so the one dimensional dataset and each hypothesis is just the boundary on the

679
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,180
line and to one side is green and to the other side it's right OK

680
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:38,560
so a really simple sort of a hypothesis class

681
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,290
now here's an example of the data distribution

682
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:47,050
forty five percent of the points like in the greens forty five percent live here

683
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,690
and these are red

684
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:53,210
and so on in the middle you have two and a half percent richardson in

685
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:57,680
two and a half percent agreed to see what would happen in one of these

686
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,430
in one of the active learning heuristics

687
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,500
so you start by sampling from random points but since the

688
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:07,760
data predominantly lies in these two clusters at the far ends let's just say the

689
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,710
initial batch of points pretty much like here and here

690
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:15,630
OK so you look at those two points maybe have four points here in four

691
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:19,270
points and the other one and you do something like you know a maximum margin

692
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:24,090
classifier something and based on that people the boundary somewhere in here

693
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:28,160
OK now you're going to query points close to the boundary to end up wearing

694
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,060
points in here

695
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:32,470
i sometimes and it's time goes on you will

696
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,800
query points closer and closer to this middle point and you basically end up converging

697
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,300
to this hypothesis

698
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:42,560
now this hypothesis has got five percent error because it gets things wrong in the

699
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,800
optimal hypothesis is this one

700
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,470
because it has only two and a half percent error

701
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,140
OK so this is an example of

702
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:52,420
the problem of sampling bias

703
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:56,800
basically what happens is that

704
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,290
you know you start with this hypothesis that sort of in the middle of all

705
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:04,750
of you greens and reds it looks like a good hypothesis and then you become

706
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:07,340
really confident that all of these have to be read

707
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:14,090
but you really have no justification for being so confident it's misplaced confidence and so

708
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:19,030
you end up with you end up with an algorithm that

709
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:25,530
not even consistent you know which is which is a fairly basic statistical guarantee you

710
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,790
forget about optimizing the number of labelled one would hope that as the number of

711
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:34,400
labelled goes to infinity at least converge to the right page and in this case

712
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,720
that wouldn't happen

713
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:40,250
OK it but it's something that's not consistent

714
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,580
and it's an example of

715
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,920
an example of how this might play out in practice if you if you think

716
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,810
back to that pedestrian identification pedestrian detection thing you about it that after seeing the

717
00:45:54,810 --> 00:46:01,210
first few labelled images the learning system this gino then sees an image of a

718
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:02,560
fire hydrant

719
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,460
and it's completely certain it's a human being you know a child or something like

720
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,770
that and so it will never ask for its label there's no there's no need

721
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:12,940
you know

722
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:18,210
the cluster of fire hydrants in the space of data is the cluster fly hydrants

723
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:22,990
in a cluster of phone books that look like this the cluster of fire hydrant

724
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:25,810
so everything

725
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,280
there's been a bunch of experimental work is this an example of that

726
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,780
there's an example of

727
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:35,380
sort of study in

728
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:42,060
so this is the the text classification setting in which the sort of hidden cluster

729
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:48,700
effect in word you have one of these active learning heuristics where initial sampling process

730
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,470
missus some clusters

731
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:54,460
and and as a result the learners completely sure about the label of the cluster

732
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,550
at the local level there are some zigzagging so we want to keep might be

733
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:01,210
the sp three hybridization

734
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,590
sp three

735
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,290
gives bonding along

736
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,570
the chain

737
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,340
that in fact

738
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,810
and this is one hundred nine degree angle

739
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,830
and also if you are really close you say well this is clearly bad but

740
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:24,410
if you make this long enough you get far enough back

741
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:27,700
in a general sense this is termed a straight

742
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:33,280
this is termed a straight chain straight chain

743
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,680
there's there's one other thing that is is similar to

744
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,080
what we've seen in the past in the case of

745
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,500
of silicate and not shown here

746
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,630
the as long as we got one hundred nine degrees

747
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:50,750
along this axis between the other bonds there's no specification what happens down here

748
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:55,890
so this this should remind you of what happens in a silicate when

749
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,680
the oxygen is done online

750
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:02,030
so it's possible to get disorder and so here you see

751
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,570
one case where

752
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,530
you have the the hydrogens on adjacent carbons

753
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,890
not facing one another words here there are lined up so if i were to

754
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,190
look on and from

755
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,610
the left down the chain i would only see one

756
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:22,050
the all the hydrogens are lined up and we call this configuration eclipse configuration is

757
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:26,600
slightly high energy whereas this is a little bit lower energy staggered and what's the

758
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,570
fact that the effect is not to give us the straight chain that goes

759
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:36,400
in the line for that you have to have the eclipse configuration here's two

760
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,630
examples of c seventeen h thirty six

761
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,330
they're both straight chain because once twisting a little bit more than the other inherent

762
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:49,570
talking about just the carbon carbon bond twisting these are both terms straight chain but

763
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:52,650
they have different conformations

764
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,180
so this is starting to make you think about

765
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:03,040
the plurality of possibilities even within the same chemical composition that would be

766
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:08,410
present in polymers here we've only got seventeen imagine if instead of seventeen became seventeen

767
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,030
what this condition

768
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:16,340
this is an example of what we mean by straight chain but it doesn't mean

769
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,470
that it's a rod like

770
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:24,220
OK but i can now show you something that's not straight chain so let's also

771
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,080
look at something called a branched chain

772
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,950
that's different and go look at one

773
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,430
go look at butane

774
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:40,560
you know that's the gas temperature is users

775
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:43,070
fuel for

776
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,890
cigarette lighters guess that's not pcr or so

777
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,960
we all now we can use it for lighting candles

778
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,660
right useful i think i can say that

779
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:56,700
well i can do it so let's look at the butane so that's number four

780
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:05,150
right so i'm just as smooth things along it's possible to just write them in

781
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:08,920
a straight line even though we know these are hundred ninety degrees

782
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,280
and we know that if there's nothing put at the end of the stick we

783
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,820
assume it's hydrogen so all of these are hydrogen carbon hydrogen linkages so i've got

784
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,270
one two three four

785
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:25,890
carbons are about one two three four five six seven eight nine ten so this

786
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,350
is as it should be c four h

787
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,630
ten and certainly this is

788
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:34,230
this is identical to

789
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:38,020
something that could be represented as follows

790
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:42,230
right so now i'm going to have the four

791
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,640
outlining a tetrahedron so there's one two

792
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:50,250
three four one two three four one two three four

793
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:55,730
remember when you're in carbon chemistry four sticks four sticks of every car

794
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,050
as what check

795
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,960
OK so this is

796
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,060
this is the the linear

797
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,960
but there's another way is another way we can do this into the following we

798
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,860
can put

799
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:10,510
and if one of the carbon

800
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:12,560
i put a branch

801
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:15,800
branch and then i'm going to use the force the rule

802
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:17,620
so one two three

803
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:21,360
one two so one two three four this has one two three

804
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:26,700
so let's count one two three four four carbons

805
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,900
and three

806
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:36,270
six nine ten ten hydrogen so on a formula basis this is also a butane

807
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:41,400
but it's the different noises as as a solid state chemist we're we're

808
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:47,540
very much attuned to molecular structure in this molecular structure the linear one is different

809
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:52,300
from this one is the branch one so this one is called iso butane

810
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:58,210
and the other way to look at it is

811
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,270
the backbone is only three carbons

812
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:05,210
so the backbones only three cards according to this rule there should be some kind

813
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,840
of propane

814
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:11,220
this another way to name this is called a propane

815
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:16,670
but it's got instead of just hydrogens one of the propane

816
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,630
how we started the transformation process approximately

817
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:25,150
well in concrete in OT employees about

818
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:27,110
twelve months ago

819
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,710
we started renewing our values

820
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,190
we checked

821
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:37,830
that's how can forty five thousand people making not a very human company that delivers

822
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,800
human technology

823
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,530
we need to change

824
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:46,250
so the nokia way had to be in years and values need to be changed

825
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:49,130
so our business is changing

826
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:53,770
and we know that it's of the dialogue with technology markets

827
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:57,370
we annihilating all the time with the society sorry of this

828
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:04,190
this going going from and another way to another just should be time so what

829
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:08,170
we did was that we opened we used to like

830
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:10,350
two ways of

831
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:11,650
driving the change

832
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,210
we had high touch

833
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:19,070
and then we had high tech by high touch women that we organised so-called nokia

834
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:23,510
way cafes as the method we

835
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,670
rolled around we went to

836
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:32,890
we went around the world in fifty nine days we had this huge participation in

837
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:39,630
one-day workshops where people from different types of works different layers of the organisation has

838
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:43,470
the flat company we do have still some layers

839
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:48,870
is that we met and we discussed about values had to renew them

840
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:54,030
and how to what does it mean for us as individuals the company to become

841
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,810
an internet company and then on

842
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:59,390
on me

843
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,390
fourteen to seventeen

844
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:04,410
and we organised nokia way jam

845
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:10,350
and that was the combination wisdom of the crowds combined with artificial intelligence

846
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:14,990
and that was something that i do is i will remember all my life because

847
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:22,770
there were seventy seven hours online and i was awake sixty hours of that so

848
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:27,750
this is how we renewed nokia way process so we engaged people first we started

849
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:32,290
deliver print airline tickets to mars

850
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:36,740
and the question was that one of our values you would like to

851
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:40,770
what kind of our ways of working you would take we due to the journey

852
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:45,090
of the market to mars had like two times for your suitcase i me and

853
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:48,470
then the habits the bad habits that you wanted to

854
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:52,630
one did you leave behind and we made small and we wanted to make it

855
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:59,090
fun we make like small inquiries we ordered like gadgets of small small and well

856
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:01,370
i forgot to bring a small

857
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:03,670
yet it would symbolize the martian

858
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:07,150
and then we had the video in on top senior leader saying that the question

859
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,210
was what what is the colour of martian

860
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:13,750
and then we started by loading actually that what what really is the journey about

861
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,570
we used real marketing

862
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:21,830
and that's something that so when delivering these airline tickets

863
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:25,850
and the idea was that hey share with your own crew and so the people

864
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:27,870
who think that have a good idea

865
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:33,730
in in how we should look like in the future well dull corporate internal comms

866
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,930
we got two questions after this

867
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:40,190
first one was what's the right answer for the question what is the colour of

868
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:43,710
right there is no right answer

869
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:48,250
and the second was was that what does it mean because i haven't got yet

870
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:52,250
the airline ticket and we were going like

871
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:57,530
this is so nineties then that there is no right answer all the color side

872
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:02,810
equal and by the way here five airline tickets to you coming immediately and shared

873
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,430
with your best friends and so we got the mix of the good mix of

874
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:11,090
people and we renewed our values we had a world cup faster sharing where our

875
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:16,670
CEO extent but so not without giving any notes had to confirm four new values

876
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:22,390
they had build from our previous ones they are achieving together engaging you meaning both

877
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:25,850
consumers and using employee achieving together

878
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:31,070
and very human and passion for innovation and i think the latter last one is

879
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:34,480
why we are here and then it was time for nokia way jam

880
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,830
we were the first

881
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:46,010
but first commercial customer of of the IBM so in that was our vendor we

882
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:52,570
have again fun that's very crucial in when trying to block

883
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,770
and generation people to work with as it has to be fun

884
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:59,730
well i forty five and about forty five thousand

885
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:06,370
thousand employees and then we need to kind of exclude our factory employees because they

886
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:11,870
involvement to nokia way jam was bit different and we we have forty five percent

887
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:19,130
of our our employees participate in jamming the the ball of the jam was threefold

888
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:20,390
it first of all

889
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:23,590
it was kind of to ensure what's happening

890
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:27,740
so let's first do

891
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,340
look at the consequence of the conservation

892
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:34,660
of mechanical energy

893
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:37,080
very powerful concept

894
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,860
and as long as we deal with gravity

895
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:41,970
you can always use

896
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:46,600
you see here on the desk something that looks like a roller coaster

897
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:51,670
and i'm going to slide and objects

898
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,940
from this direction

899
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,730
created a little bit better

900
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:04,730
he was that roller coaster

901
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,140
this is

902
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,880
and then it goes up again

903
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:13,380
and that if circle has radius are

904
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,570
this point eight

905
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,380
i release it

906
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,900
zero speed i assume that there is no friction for now

907
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,780
this point b

908
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:30,610
i define here

909
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:34,350
y equals zero one is even more important i defined it

910
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,080
you equals zero

911
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,890
and this is the direction of the direction of y

912
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:42,290
at eighty object has no

913
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,820
velocity no speech

914
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,890
a b of course it does

915
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,300
it has converted some potential energy

916
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,460
the kinetic energy at this point c

917
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:55,420
is had reached maximum

918
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:00,120
velocity that it can ever have because all the potential energy has been converted to

919
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,380
kinetic energy

920
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,780
and at this point the

921
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:07,030
if it ever reaches that point

922
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,420
that will be

923
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,040
the velocity say

924
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:12,860
OK i start off

925
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:17,290
o point is at a different distance h

926
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,310
above this level

927
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:23,370
and so i apply on the conservation of mechanical energy

928
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:24,650
so i know that

929
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:25,860
you have a

930
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,530
plus the kinetic energy at any

931
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,130
which is zero

932
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,990
must be you would be

933
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:34,190
plus kinetic energy b

934
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,320
must be u ed

935
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:42,970
plus kinetic energy density must be you would be less kinetic energy and if there

936
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,790
is no friction no other forces only gravity so we lose no

937
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:51,430
no energy goes lost in terms of friction

938
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,570
we know that this

939
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,820
by different

940
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:00,770
these two are

941
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:04,430
so now i can write this in general terms of y

942
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,130
o point six this

943
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,740
this point the single that being

944
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,500
location y above zero line

945
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,320
and i can write down now

946
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:17,040
that you a which is MGH

947
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,210
that was given when i started that was all the energy i had it was

948
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:24,820
my total mechanical energy if i call this you zero which is free choice i

949
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,390
you have be which is now

950
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,570
and g

951
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:33,990
plus one half

952
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,500
the square at that position why they should hold what you see there should hold

953
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,460
every point

954
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,750
that i have yet to hold for a full b was seen for the for

955
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,250
any point

956
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:45,880
i lose my and

957
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,750
and so you find here

958
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:53,030
we summarize the squared

959
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:55,570
the clothes

960
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,100
two g

961
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,040
time h minus y

962
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,240
so they should hold for all these points

963
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:06,470
therefore it should also hold for pointing

964
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:08,810
at point d

965
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,190
that is

966
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,880
something very important there is a requirement

967
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:17,310
there is a requirement that there is a centripetal acceleration

968
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:18,900
which is in this direction

969
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:21,820
eight centripetal

970
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:24,180
and that centripetal acceleration

971
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:25,340
is a must

972
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:26,590
for this object

973
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,400
to reach that point to d

974
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:34,050
that centripetal acceleration is we remember from when we played with the bucket of water

975
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,240
that is the squared

976
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:38,210
divided by or

977
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:39,430
and this

978
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:41,090
must be larger

979
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:42,140
or equal

980
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:44,940
to the gravitational acceleration g

981
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,490
if it is not larger

982
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,820
the bucket of water wouldn't have made it to that point to d

983
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:55,710
so this is my second equation that i'm going to use to look very carefully

984
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,260
so the square must be larger or equal than

985
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,530
so i have here the screen which is two g

986
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:05,170
times age

987
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:08,600
minus y but why for that point he

988
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:10,070
these two or

989
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:12,050
so i put in two are

990
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:15,080
must be larger or equal

991
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,630
two g are

992
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,400
lose my g

993
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:23,080
o two h minus for our

994
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,530
must be larger

995
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,260
o equal to our

996
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:28,960
q h was be larger or equal

997
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,400
two and half hours

998
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:33,390
there's is a classic result

999
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:37,500
that almost every person who has taken physics will remember

1000
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:40,040
it by no means intuitive

1001
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:44,300
it means that if i have this boy and i'll show you shortly

1002
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,730
and i let the ball

1003
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,740
go into this rollercoaster

1004
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,350
that it will not

1005
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,840
make this point

1006
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,380
we defined as well class in

1007
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:55,420
we saw that very nice properties

1008
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,170
we formulated the spectral clustering algorithm that we just so it's more or less computing

1009
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:03,700
i vectors in doing this implicit embedding into

1010
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:07,030
our t for some t

1011
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:11,250
and this gives you a clustering in some way

1012
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:12,800
and here we see no way of

1013
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,390
why this might actually be a good thing

1014
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:17,710
at least in innocent

1015
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,180
so if causes derivation

1016
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,610
as lots of

1017
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,280
lots of things what i didn't tell you is

1018
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:26,930
of course

1019
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:30,530
you want to find more than two clusters you need to something different here

1020
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,850
it becomes a bit more complicated than that i really have light on it but

1021
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:40,890
what what essentially to do here is actually might have like

1022
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,250
i have it on the slide

1023
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:49,470
essentially what you do is you don't just define one indicator vector

1024
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:52,910
but we define a matrix of indicator vectors

1025
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:56,460
so you could find something like

1026
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:59,550
if you if you want to find k clusters

1027
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:02,490
you define the class then became director of

1028
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,220
which is just

1029
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:09,250
i is zero

1030
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:11,720
excise in the cluster ck

1031
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:14,720
and it's one otherwise

1032
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,460
so you case that indicator vectors

1033
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:20,990
and and then you can do it actually by matrix which which is similar to

1034
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,640
the ones i presented to you but the mass gets a bit longer so i

1035
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,470
don't want to show it

1036
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:28,960
can can write down a very similar way and what you end up

1037
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:33,070
so this matrix eight years actually what is what they call a few so maybe

1038
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,410
call it a ge

1039
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:37,940
so it's just a matrix of the cluster indicator vectors

1040
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,160
one can then see

1041
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:42,770
but one can write spectral clustering in a similar way i did but you just

1042
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:47,030
now in the matrices here instead of just f transpose unless we had no the

1043
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:49,890
matrix h transpose lh

1044
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:52,600
this matrix just as many columns of this

1045
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:55,610
classes we want to find

1046
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:59,890
and then there's some more complicated version of this very with serum which also tells

1047
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:00,830
you now

1048
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,240
that the solution of this problem

1049
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:06,710
consists in taking the first k i was

1050
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:07,640
so this is

1051
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:11,140
once you understood the first thing this is just doing them as a bit more

1052
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,270
complicated so it will work out

1053
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:19,080
OK and actually have right up where you can look it up if you want

1054
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:24,270
to explain later

1055
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:25,590
OK so

1056
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,080
i showed you the simplified problem where we just say we want to minimize cut

1057
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,460
subject to a equals b

1058
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:34,610
if you do ratiocut

1059
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:38,670
it becomes a bit more complicated again actually the main trick is you just need

1060
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:41,420
to be a bit more clever when defining the vector s

1061
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:44,080
and then everything else works of

1062
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:50,400
and it's exactly the same principle we also do the exercises you one

1063
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:55,140
so what happens then is if we do the same thing for a ship at

1064
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:56,480
the end of the

1065
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:58,300
exactly the thing we ended up

1066
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:03,260
simpler version the angle vectors of the mathematics and

1067
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:06,230
if we don't do the same for normalized cut the whole

1068
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:10,860
mechanism works again after twenty here there but in principle it works and then

1069
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:14,360
you just end up looking at the eigenvectors of l about the anxieties of the

1070
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,580
normalized graph laplacian

1071
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:21,090
the intuition is now

1072
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:22,710
if you if you look at

1073
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:27,520
clustering from this graph theoretic perspective where you want to find clusters in data which

1074
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,390
partitions of a graph

1075
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,290
then if you

1076
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,460
i want to minimize ratiocut

1077
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:37,830
if you take the iron makers of l use unnormalized spectral clustering two as the

1078
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:43,640
if you want to find out if you want to optimize on the normalized cut

1079
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:47,420
you just take the i can vectors of the normalized graph laplacian and then it's

1080
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,180
called normalized spectrum

1081
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:57,590
sorry how

1082
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:04,340
four OK

1083
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:06,360
OK so that's it

1084
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:10,260
for many clustering algorithms so first of all

1085
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,110
they just output

1086
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,360
the clustering of the data like the discrete partition of the data set to give

1087
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,620
them as input

1088
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:21,450
now there are different ways to know that you can the most standard way or

1089
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,720
maybe the most appropriate way would be

1090
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,840
so in some way you need to extend the clustering to the whole data space

1091
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,260
so that you can create new data points

1092
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,810
and for some algorithms like in a very simple you just assign them to the

1093
01:07:32,810 --> 01:07:35,200
next centuries some of the trivia

1094
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:40,320
for some i mean for spectral clustering this mathematical way of doing it

1095
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:42,680
but i don't want to explain there so

1096
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:46,050
you can see that instead of taking matrices you can do it in a continuous

1097
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:50,800
basically take integral operators whatever and then you can define it but that's actually very

1098
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:58,010
complicated and nobody does it apart from mathematicians so what i suggest practices

1099
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:03,800
i mean essentially extending clustering tools spaces classification right so you have a data set

1100
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:07,660
you have labels on part of training points and the points if labels on them

1101
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,990
now you want to assign labels to other data points so this is exactly the

1102
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:15,300
problem of classification so you need to sort of justification problem as an extension operator

1103
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,360
of clustering

1104
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:22,870
and then of course a lot of questions i mean what classifier and so on

1105
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,990
so it's it's that's nothing which is really trivial so

1106
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,440
but of course it across the problem in practice

1107
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:39,410
OK so there are a few things which i want to comment on that

1108
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:43,110
OK we so i've already told but i want to stress again so we don't

1109
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:45,280
have any quality whatsoever

1110
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:48,110
when the relaxation beat

1111
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:52,660
is anything related to the problem originally wanted to sort of

1112
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,900
so somehow

1113
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:59,050
but things can happen and you can construct examples very bad things happen but those

1114
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:01,560
examples often very and constructed

1115
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:05,790
in practice this often works surprisingly well it's really i mean if you compare spectral

1116
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:07,850
clustering to other clustering algorithms

1117
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:12,920
at compared to k means it usually works

1118
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,820
the reason why we use

1119
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:22,560
k means in this final step after the embedding in three so they actually wasn't

1120
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:25,050
reason so this is just after the embedding

1121
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:29,150
suggesting that any out more less should be able to

1122
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:32,910
five one b can index

1123
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:35,300
first of all let's decide how we can

1124
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:41,040
put all the information that we created this index into temporary five

1125
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:45,140
the simplest idea what we can do

1126
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:50,150
so i don't know why but in all this slide i put it from

1127
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:54,330
right to left is likely of writing on the desktop

1128
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:56,710
but what we can do it can take

1129
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,460
first works

1130
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,730
then we can put a number of course in this work

1131
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:05,240
then reporting

1132
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:08,920
number of documents then the next sentence

1133
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,300
so far and going and doing this procedure so we the file

1134
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:17,290
this file contains sort it

1135
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:18,850
he is from all

1136
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:21,820
index file all words sorted

1137
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:27,600
this is the order in which processing our dictionary

1138
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,910
and for every he

1139
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:33,730
you have the document is always sorted

1140
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,560
in order of increasing because

1141
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:39,620
we decided that we are adding documents

1142
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:44,070
in creating and using increasing idea of this document

1143
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:46,870
when he

1144
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,120
index enough documents of

1145
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,130
keep all memory bees

1146
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:56,600
so OK we don't have enough memory

1147
01:10:56,620 --> 01:11:01,960
we simply take our index from memory and write this file this structure

1148
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:05,100
we want to match them

1149
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,590
how to model them

1150
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:10,630
because every temporary file is already sort

1151
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,470
it's very easy to create an article started fires

1152
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,670
and the reason is

1153
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,830
married and so on

1154
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:24,020
and the result is very very simple algorithm

1155
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,100
imagine that we have

1156
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:27,710
only two stars

1157
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:29,030
and what are doing

1158
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:32,310
we are taking work from phil source and

1159
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,160
work from second source

1160
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,620
and they look OK

1161
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,460
first is smaller

1162
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:42,610
so in this case from the first stars that put into the output index

1163
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:46,760
four and post lists of this works

1164
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:48,370
then moved

1165
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,760
four in this first index index

1166
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:53,970
now we are equal

1167
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,710
we have put into the results only one word

1168
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:00,860
and in i was first leased and then put was this to this word

1169
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,260
and in doing so

1170
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,350
four for the whole two

1171
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:07,120
sets of data

1172
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,010
this was

1173
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:14,210
so we're taking two words from from two possibilities

1174
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:20,110
we see that we have the same word can be put into our numerous index

1175
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:25,040
to it's dictionary put the first work a in this example

1176
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,600
then we see that

1177
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:28,330
in both files

1178
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:29,690
there are

1179
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,370
two closely

1180
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:32,830
link to

1181
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,910
so we that input for this work to postulate

1182
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,440
then we see that there are different

1183
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:44,230
and a smaller we are processing a b

1184
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,200
then this species to be and

1185
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:51,020
so we're doing this again and again and to emerge index

1186
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:53,660
this is a very common variation in

1187
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:57,770
in data processing if we have sorted data

1188
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:05,640
because every temporary index is already started the whole industry is very easy to create

1189
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:09,180
and this is very good separation because

1190
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,210
again during this process

1191
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:13,850
the always working only with the one

1192
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,960
sure processing right now

1193
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,440
and we actually don't care about all ports for this work because the energy only

1194
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,470
when we can merge

1195
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:24,020
but by force so

1196
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,420
we are very limited

1197
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:29,560
on memory you can use very small amount of memory

1198
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:33,380
we know how many iterations iterations will do

1199
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,780
and also

1200
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,700
as i said in the second lecture

1201
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:43,370
more than half is always faster than they doing sequential access when accessing byte by

1202
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:47,530
byte and they don't do any jumps ahead or

1203
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:49,160
keeping data

1204
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:53,930
so this is linear access to data and it's also very

1205
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,200
so what

1206
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:57,220
merge its basic

1207
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,650
algorithm that

1208
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:04,450
nearly every search engine is doing during building index

1209
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:07,140
any open source project that saw

1210
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,970
during the building of the index is doing this

1211
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:13,290
you can

1212
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:17,670
i see this as a very good example of this in a very good example

1213
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,280
so you can see that

1214
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:21,360
it builds everything in memory

1215
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:23,460
created this temporary index

1216
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:28,130
down into the file into the into a temporary file

1217
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,940
and then they are them

1218
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:30,930
two there

1219
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,390
bigger index

1220
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:35,710
this is the main approach

1221
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,970
without this approach if you're trying to create index

1222
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:48,190
so another another approaches try to remove from memory possibly indexing

1223
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:49,720
combine them together

1224
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:54,480
but i can assure you that this approach is much faster than ever everything that

1225
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,660
has been invented

1226
01:14:56,660 --> 01:15:01,440
during the whole history of feuding of indexes

1227
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:03,560
OK so

1228
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:10,740
we are going to compress so index and also said sometimes

1229
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:14,070
data is not on the smaller

1230
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,290
but we can access it fast

1231
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:22,080
and in the second lecture during my short introduction to compression and all that what

1232
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,510
is compression

1233
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:27,470
for compression we need to create some more the following day data

1234
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:33,320
some approach some algorithms that maps of data to states

1235
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:38,760
more probable and less probable states so it should output this state probability of the

1236
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:42,900
and someone quarter that can encode

1237
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:47,600
we have to move around the minimum number of all

1238
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:50,350
two men john edwards and we have

1239
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:54,990
like many specialized relations this is not just assertions

1240
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:59,320
would start with the nineteen ninety

1241
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:03,530
because different strokes for different folks

1242
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,220
document that

1243
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:13,660
in the year and we certainly want to connect less than average over a number

1244
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:14,780
of other people

1245
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:17,350
also on documents and day

1246
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:20,520
in each of the people we get most

1247
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,810
four randomly pulses

1248
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:27,790
financial supporter of parents

1249
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:29,590
to get my

1250
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,530
which can be

1251
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,730
people use

1252
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:36,280
do you take the go into water

1253
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,760
four neighbours and users

1254
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:43,110
rules so we faced with real issues

1255
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:46,930
can we what was

1256
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:50,690
is something everybody everybody else

1257
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:54,460
many of us

1258
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:57,940
well this is a

1259
01:16:57,950 --> 01:17:05,120
made by this everybody else in the networks so we want to have her abusive

1260
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:06,770
husband she would about

1261
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,950
king and her with

1262
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:11,320
this new venture

1263
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,630
literally case

1264
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:15,680
a great personal danger

1265
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:20,480
there's reason why computer scientists the social sciences

1266
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:23,500
to avoid class actions suit

1267
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:27,960
i want to see that some

1268
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:35,680
so we talking about a partial membership model that works what i call this FLC

1269
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:38,810
it was found

1270
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:45,240
so you can to be just a bit more referencing that the your mother of

1271
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:51,960
in fact

1272
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:55,110
it's interesting when you think about all the time

1273
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:59,960
of that and so can you do that with this year

1274
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:04,230
has been the century from thirteen percent

1275
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:08,420
nineteen eighty down to four percent

1276
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:14,620
and was that trees are coming out of the paper on this in the whole

1277
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:17,250
of course this is maybe one thing

1278
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:21,690
so this is an actual

1279
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:28,210
but to ensure that different kinds of people close to the resources that are of

1280
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:33,320
and while the first pursue solid

1281
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:36,050
that you have to look at this important

1282
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:37,380
that is is is

1283
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:45,030
so but this is this is all have a lot of different ways

1284
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:47,660
are being to

1285
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:52,370
and this is different from the old traditional small groups where there was a village

1286
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:55,210
this morning

1287
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:03,530
so i and my moving to that some of the most important

1288
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:04,990
it slow

1289
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:13,650
necessary that is one of the

1290
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:20,250
we then moved this is my

1291
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,840
i have evidence for

1292
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:26,510
two what i think since world war two two in england and the netherlands per

1293
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,920
travel to london

1294
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:32,690
the situation

1295
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,260
which is the fact that was

1296
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:38,460
typically home

1297
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:43,050
or ten minutes and work

1298
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:45,140
but that travel between them

1299
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,060
this is

1300
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:52,480
well let me be the one that we never have been done

1301
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,190
when you get are expressed

1302
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:59,980
we're trying to play go point to point you have to have vols

1303
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:03,280
but you know this when new world of course wall

1304
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:07,690
you know if you need to sort of pieces

1305
01:20:07,690 --> 01:20:08,940
and then something

1306
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:20,700
the total of the number to call networked individualism person's individual unit of interaction

1307
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:27,270
he said that all have private concerns therefore we have this

1308
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:29,020
all in many ways

1309
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:32,220
the baseline algorithm that we compare ourselves to

1310
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:37,480
it uses fast distance transforms and dynamic programming in order to compute all detections in

1311
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:41,450
image in time that is linear in the number of parts in the model and

1312
01:20:41,450 --> 01:20:44,530
also linear in the number of locations in the image

1313
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,470
the problem with this is that in modern set up

1314
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:52,520
we typically have very dense feature maps and resample scale space very densely as well

1315
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:55,600
this means that the number of locations is typically huge

1316
01:20:55,610 --> 01:21:00,470
and also because we use these rich filters to represent parts often the cost to

1317
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:05,220
compute a part score is also quite expensive to these two factors are the bottleneck

1318
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:07,520
in practice for the baseline algorithm

1319
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:12,830
as we all know cascade algorithms have been used over and over again to speed

1320
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:14,230
up here

1321
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:21,150
methods in computer vision so here we appeal to cascade architecture in order to compute

1322
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:23,910
parts causing many fewer locations

1323
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,890
so we empirically valid

1324
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:29,210
evaluate our approach

1325
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:33,300
using some models that are a little bit more sophisticated than just a simple star

1326
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:37,220
model so what we do is we take in the next year or disjunction of

1327
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:38,280
star models

1328
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:42,920
so each component in this mixture model is itself the star model which is defined

1329
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,960
in terms of nine parts

1330
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:50,390
each one of these parts is implemented as a linear filter on hard features so

1331
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:55,080
there is the group part which captures entire objects appearance and of course resolution

1332
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:59,450
and there are eight additional parts which capture localized regions of the object of finer

1333
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:05,010
each one of these parts is allowed to move relative to its anchor position but

1334
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:11,510
it costs something that is modeled by separable quadratic equations function

1335
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:16,610
so the two more ingredients so we need to formulate the cascade algorithm for star

1336
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:20,930
models the first is we need an ordering of the parts which implicitly defines a

1337
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:25,590
hierarchy of models the i th model this hierarchy is defined by adding the i

1338
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:28,070
th part the previous model hierarchy

1339
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:32,930
now if you recall the definition of the score function for every location omega we're

1340
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:36,220
maximizing over part locations individually

1341
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:40,530
this means that as soon as we place in your part in this hierarchy in

1342
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:45,030
its optimal location there remains the optimal location for that part as we

1343
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:49,640
place the additional parts because of this property we can say that the score of

1344
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:52,550
an intermediate model is a partial score

1345
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:56,840
which can be extended to the full score simply by adding in the optimal scores

1346
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,880
of the remaining parts

1347
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:02,970
the next ingredient that we need for the cascade algorithm is a sequence of thresholds

1348
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,160
the star cascade algorithm operates

1349
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:09,280
by going between two different steps

1350
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:11,840
in the print makers step we look at

1351
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:13,590
in the current partial score

1352
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:18,080
of the model and we compare two threshold in order to decide whether or not

1353
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,980
we should abandon the real location omega

1354
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:24,150
printed away and move on to the next location

1355
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:28,050
in the next step we do prune delta operation

1356
01:23:29,150 --> 01:23:31,450
what this series replacing on new part

1357
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:36,230
into the model and we need to search over displacements but most of those displacements

1358
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:40,350
are going to be too costly and therefore we can immediately discard that by using

1359
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:42,520
a threshold test

1360
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:46,830
so now walk through simple example of how the algorithm works in practice you can

1361
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:48,600
understand exactly what it's doing

1362
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:53,550
we need a three ingredients the object model part ordering thresholds we take the test

1363
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:57,590
image we converted into feature pyramid representation

1364
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,070
to simplify things of focus on a single scale of the pyramid and a single

1365
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:03,150
component of the model

1366
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:07,080
also because it's much nicer to look at images rather than visualizations of feature maps

1367
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:09,340
of simply replace actual image

1368
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:14,300
the cascade algorithm operates by maintaining score tables for each one of the parts during

1369
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:17,900
the showing score tables for the root part in the first two

1370
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:23,840
after that so the going to begin by testing root locations with the root filter

1371
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,220
most of these locations are going to score poorly in their going to fail the

1372
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:28,860
first print maker test

1373
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:33,540
this is represented by shading the corresponding cells in its core table grapes

1374
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:36,610
so we keep testing locations most of them fell

1375
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,920
hopefully eventually

1376
01:24:38,930 --> 01:24:40,150
we get to

1377
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:44,960
a location that scores high enough to pass the first threshold test

1378
01:24:44,970 --> 01:24:50,180
now that this has happened we have to consider the contribution in the first part

1379
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:54,140
we do that by conducting and displacement search

1380
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:58,390
in principle we have to search over all possible displacement however we threshold test in

1381
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:00,370
order to reject most of them

1382
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:04,900
therefore we only have to consider a small number of locations which are those indicated

1383
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:05,680
by this

1384
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:11,770
part one score tables so in those locations we have to compute part one score

1385
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:15,750
we do that we find the optimal location for part one we compared to its

1386
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:18,670
threshold test for the next egg operation

1387
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:23,440
here it fails which means that we reject this root location and we move on

1388
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,240
to the next location

1389
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,260
this location

1390
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:28,210
as is like the previous one

1391
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:31,510
again we conducted displacement search

1392
01:25:32,370 --> 01:25:35,410
displacements are rejected however there are few

1393
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:39,580
that do pass and again in these locations we have to compute the parts for

1394
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:44,190
the now know that there is significant overlap between these locations and the previously computed

1395
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:48,640
locations which means that we can simply reuse most of the computation that we already

1396
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,500
have done this

1397
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:54,520
element to the algorithm is the key to making the cascade fast for deformable part

1398
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,010
models there are only a small number of locations here where we actually have to

1399
01:25:58,010 --> 01:25:59,800
compute new part scores

1400
01:25:59,810 --> 01:26:01,900
so after computing this cause

1401
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:06,880
we find the optimal displacements compared to threshold in this case it passes which means

1402
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:12,510
that we can move on to the second part we repeat this whole process again

1403
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:16,420
and then we continue doing this for all the remaining parts in this case all

1404
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:21,300
the remaining threshold tests were passed which means that we can report the object hypothesis

1405
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:25,860
and then move on to bigger and better things like finding more bicycles

1406
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:31,020
essential to the performance of the algorithm is choosing good thresholds

1407
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:34,170
now we want to specials to be effective meaning that they should for a lot

1408
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:38,140
of true negatives because if they don't the cascade the fast but they also have

1409
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:41,900
to be safe and in the sense efficient for many true positives because if they

1410
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:46,310
do will lose recall that we heard are average precision score

1411
01:26:46,330 --> 01:26:50,410
we can make the notion of safe threshold to more precise and we do so

1412
01:26:50,410 --> 01:26:55,770
by introducing probably approximately admissible thresholds you can take x to be an i i

1413
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:59,570
d set positive examples drawn from some unknown distribution d

1414
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:03,130
we can then define the error rate of a sequence of thresholds t

1415
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:07,960
to be the probability under random draw an example from d that the cascade algorithm

1416
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:11,930
computes a score other than the actual score

1417
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:14,650
now if the error rate was exactly zero

1418
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:20,190
then we would have admissible thresholds we were never proven false we never print not

1419
01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:24,770
be great but the problem is that it's very difficult we don't know how to

1420
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:27,150
heck provably

1421
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,980
admissible thresholds that

1422
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,380
are also effective in practice and or in other words make it fast cascade so

1423
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:36,290
we can relax is a bit by just saying that we want to have a

1424
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:42,150
epsilon delta probably approximately admissible thresholds and what this means is that the probability that

1425
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:43,240
the error rate

1426
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:48,030
exceeds small number epsilon is bounded by a small number delta

1427
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:52,680
so as has been used in other work on cascades one method of picking thresholds

1428
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:56,930
is to select the minimum of partial scores over the examples in your training set

1429
01:27:57,770 --> 01:28:02,990
now we show that if you do this then that leads to probably approximately admissible

1430
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:07,350
well i construct the laplacian of this graph and this is something we have seen

1431
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:13,500
earlier and in the case of such a graph the lab class is just

1432
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:17,220
for this

1433
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:22,270
it's just adjacency matrix almost like the adjacency matrix of the graph

1434
01:28:22,290 --> 01:28:28,060
so if you actually look at it it's mine was adjacency matrix of the graph

1435
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:31,890
and on the diagonal i have the degree of each vertex

1436
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:37,020
now what the spectral clustering spectral clustering is just taking the first i can vector

1437
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:42,790
of this rather well the first one is actually the zero i connected the constant

1438
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:47,180
functions of the first one we usually think that the first known const

1439
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:49,120
constant will not be useful

1440
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:55,270
i take no one equals one the one said i can vector problem

1441
01:28:58,140 --> 01:28:59,660
this i can vector

1442
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:05,220
well i have a six by six matrix so this i can vector is

1443
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,890
six long vector

1444
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:14,120
moreover you know if you know the first row corresponds to the first vertex

1445
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:19,270
i think that one the second row corresponds to the thing to this one in

1446
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:21,430
and so on

1447
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:29,080
each entry of this vector corresponds to a vertex of the graph

1448
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:34,680
OK so this i can vector is actually on the side

1449
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:39,790
often number to each vertex of the graph

1450
01:29:39,810 --> 01:29:43,030
so i can vector is a function on the graph it an assignment of the

1451
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:45,290
number to each vertex in the graph

1452
01:29:45,290 --> 01:29:47,760
now how do i clusters

1453
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,720
well i think it's very clear from this one right we see that the first

1454
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,470
three negative the first for the next three are positive

1455
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:59,290
well why don't they just cluster positive versus negative

1456
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:05,060
and it turns out this is actually the correct way to cluster this graph

1457
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:08,430
you know i didn't define what it means to cluster y it's kind of just

1458
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:11,680
from looking at it it's clear that if you want to copy it is located

1459
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,680
in the middle

1460
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:23,120
and that is the normalized clustering which is a variation of what would become scheme

1461
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:31,160
this is closely related to something called the min cost and the mincut basically if

1462
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,720
you just mean car

1463
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:34,370
you want to cut

1464
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,790
the number of

1465
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:43,910
that just which are cut to split this graph into parts OK so for this

1466
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:46,930
graph it's best to cut it in the middle

1467
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:51,490
so mincut is OK and there are some problems with it because if you have

1468
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:52,430
for example

1469
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:57,330
if i have enough another vertex here in one edge connecting it i can just

1470
01:30:57,330 --> 01:30:58,970
cut this out

1471
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:00,990
the mincut is the same

1472
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:06,450
right this this i cut this one that but

1473
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:11,140
but somehow not as nice as cutting it in the middle so a better version

1474
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:14,660
of it some sort of balance cut when you say well i would like to

1475
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:19,140
have it cut which is small so i removed the small number of edges but

1476
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:23,060
so that the two parts of the graph after i cut

1477
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:25,950
stay balanced

1478
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:27,720
in some sense you know

1479
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:29,890
you don't want one five to be

1480
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:34,520
much much larger than the other one otherwise this single isolated vertex would kill you

1481
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:42,260
OK so this is nice so now if you think about the class and so

1482
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:49,100
the luftwaffe matrix has the following basic properties this is really an but has mentioned

1483
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:54,080
several times but i would just like to emphasise this

1484
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:57,370
what is the property well if i have an assignment

1485
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:02,680
numbers to each vertex of the graph

1486
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:10,200
the club plus for suppose left the laplacian matrix is nothing else but the some

1487
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:13,770
the differences square so

1488
01:32:13,790 --> 01:32:17,520
i take the difference between every two adjacent vertices

1489
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:20,810
vertices and a sum them all up

1490
01:32:20,850 --> 01:32:25,100
OK so i take the difference between f two and f three f one f

1491
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,660
two f one f three f three and four

1492
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:31,680
four and five and so on but only more just once

1493
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:36,160
so it kind of measures how much the function change us

1494
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:37,640
along this graph

1495
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,470
and this is a lot less

1496
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:42,560
now if you think about it

1497
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:46,540
what happens when you havoc on the way to think about the cost one way

1498
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:48,060
to think about

1499
01:32:49,910 --> 01:32:53,660
well if a cut is just

1500
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:57,790
you want to say that some of the vertices will be brad some of them

1501
01:32:57,790 --> 01:33:01,850
will be blue right so i cut is just a subset of the vertices

1502
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:06,470
if i have a subset of the artists

1503
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,720
i can assign

1504
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:14,890
one of that to the to the like in SM one can send zero to

1505
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:16,560
everything else

1506
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:20,240
if i do that what is going to happen if i just think the some

1507
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:22,100
different square

1508
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:26,330
this sound is going to to be

1509
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:30,450
if two vertices are in the same class then the value of the same because

1510
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:32,930
someone for the same partition

1511
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:35,200
and the difference is going to visit

1512
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:38,100
if the vote is same different class

1513
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:40,410
the difference is going to be one

1514
01:33:40,410 --> 01:33:41,890
so the difference

1515
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:45,350
is going to be one vertices which are not in the same class which in

1516
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:49,270
different parts of the graph and zero

1517
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:52,350
four vertices which are in the same class

1518
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:55,580
what does it mean when i some them all up that means i'm just summing

1519
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:59,270
up the edges which cross the boundary of

1520
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:00,640
the cut

1521
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,390
that's exactly the cost

1522
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:06,160
so plus actually calculate the cost for such functions

1523
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:09,310
and that explains why

1524
01:34:09,330 --> 01:34:17,580
so far have not give exact derivation although it's not hard but that explains that

1525
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:26,760
while minimizing the plus and minimizing reference pose lf basically is an approximation of relaxation

1526
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:30,120
for actually finding the best cost

1527
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:34,120
that's the outside

1528
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:38,520
what happens when

1529
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:42,560
so this the spectral clustering that's how it works

1530
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,890
and this is if you have a graph it's a pretty good way to go

1531
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:51,330
in there are the methods but this is this is a very popular

1532
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:55,020
now if you have data

1533
01:34:55,040 --> 01:35:00,520
you want to conferences graph from the data and one way to do it is

1534
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:03,060
to actually do all

1535
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:07,830
the gaussians edge weights

1536
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:12,310
OK and there some results basically saying it's actually kind of interesting it turns out

1537
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:15,160
and you get more and more data

1538
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:16,950
the real world is complicated

1539
01:35:16,970 --> 01:35:21,450
if i fit the if i look at the curvature tensile strength as a function

1540
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:24,160
of concrete

1541
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:28,850
the components that go into a concrete or world

1542
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:30,830
then that isn't going to be

1543
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:33,680
a linear if it is going to be exactly quadratic it is going to be

1544
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:37,680
any parametric curve i write down

1545
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:40,040
so i want to be able to use

1546
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:44,060
a complicated model so that's why i want to fit

1547
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:49,600
then when we do it in practice we get these crazy fit

1548
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:52,980
don't work well and we knew that they were crazy

1549
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,660
so i introduced this idea of the validation set so that we'd have some way

1550
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:59,930
of computing knowing they were crazy but when we looked at them

1551
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:04,200
we knew that these wildly oscillating has one sensible

1552
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:09,750
rather than relying on the validation set what we can do is tell the computer

1553
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:11,020
in advance

1554
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:14,540
don't accept solutions that we know that we're not going to like

1555
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:17,810
i don't accept solutions wildly oscillate

1556
01:36:20,970 --> 01:36:23,950
that's the general idea we want to be able to specify

1557
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:26,600
what makes a nasty complicated curve

1558
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:31,160
the way mathematically we can do it is often by what's called shrinkage or weight

1559
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:33,660
which is to say

1560
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:37,720
you know i think many of these components of my weight vector w are going

1561
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:39,600
to be close to zero

1562
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:44,270
so they remember the w one says how important is the first column in my

1563
01:36:44,290 --> 01:36:47,810
training set w two is how important is the second column

1564
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:50,000
if i'd extended my input

1565
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:52,350
space that had many extra column

1566
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:55,100
but the weights those columns with zero

1567
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,660
then they wouldn't have any extra facts

1568
01:36:57,660 --> 01:37:00,470
and if the weights for these extra column very small then they would have to

1569
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:05,660
begin effect that will stop me from introducing wild oscillations by adding extra features to

1570
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:07,140
my model

1571
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:13,120
it's often the case in a lot of models is the machine learning saying the

1572
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:15,100
parameters are close to zero

1573
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:18,970
similar to saying don't make

1574
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:23,350
regression surfaces of classification boundaries very weakly

1575
01:37:23,850 --> 01:37:29,330
and the reason that early stopping is really working is that

1576
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:32,520
the way the code is implemented as you start with the weight vector that close

1577
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:36,060
to zero and the optimizer makes the weights grow bigger

1578
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:40,140
so by stopping the algorithm early what you're doing is preventing the weights from getting

1579
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:45,830
if we have identified that's really what we want to do

1580
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:49,180
we just don't want quickly because we can just tell compute that we can say

1581
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:52,600
don't give the solutions that have large predators

1582
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:02,220
the way that we tell the computer to do something and specify what our objective

1583
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:03,040
should be

1584
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:03,910
it's a

1585
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:09,080
if f was the objectives that we talked about so far something like squared error

1586
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,790
likelihood look like

1587
01:38:11,810 --> 01:38:15,140
then what we can do is add another ten to that object to say we

1588
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,640
would like you to do well on the training set we want to be able

1589
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:19,870
to explain the training set well but

1590
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:20,830
also a

1591
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:25,200
don't make the way it's too big so we could actually objective minus lambda some

1592
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:28,970
positive number times the sum of the absolute values of the way so if we

1593
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:32,720
get massive weight vector this term will be very negative and that will give the

1594
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:36,790
bad objective so the algorithm will find solutions like

1595
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:40,450
this some choice here say

1596
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:44,350
i chose to take the absolute value of the weight here and that has a

1597
01:38:44,350 --> 01:38:47,140
particular names this an l one regularizer

1598
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:52,000
and in the context of doing the squares it's called the last so has this

1599
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:57,950
the particular combination of doing least squares and this regularisation has name so that indicates

1600
01:38:57,950 --> 01:39:03,450
that might be useful tool another particular combination has another name if we take the

1601
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:05,040
square of the way

1602
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:12,700
and we're doing least squares regression then called ridge regression analysis lt regularisation just

1603
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:18,540
so that that's a way of setting up regularisation

1604
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:20,140
it's not the only way

1605
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:22,120
another thing we could do

1606
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:24,500
is say a

1607
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:27,430
i think i know how big my weight vector should be

1608
01:39:28,850 --> 01:39:32,180
remember w is a vector is something which you could imagine pointing from the origin

1609
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:34,660
out somewhere and it has a length so

1610
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:37,950
the sum of the squares of the elements of the

1611
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:40,200
the square euclidean like

1612
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:41,970
so what i could do it i could say

1613
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:44,470
you know i think i know how long that's going to be

1614
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:47,180
because i'm going to use the length of the weight vector

1615
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:49,870
as a proxy for how we my surfaces

1616
01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:55,010
so i could say i maximise my objective but make sure that the length of

1617
01:39:55,010 --> 01:39:57,370
some particular value

1618
01:39:57,390 --> 01:40:00,970
or you could say make sure that the sum of absolute terms some particular value

1619
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:04,060
instead if you wanted to use that as your proxy

1620
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:06,560
and that might be

1621
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,480
easier to think about because you might be able to look at the parameters and

1622
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:14,390
see what they mean and decide how to set this up whereas maybe

1623
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:17,500
this is sort of a fight between fitting the data and

1624
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:21,120
not making promises too big and it's not clear whether that fights going to end

1625
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:26,310
before you actually do it and so maybe you're not happy with that

1626
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:30,600
happily it turns out that these two stories are actually exactly the same thing

1627
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:31,540
say a

1628
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:34,360
and of isolated the conditions under which

1629
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:36,850
the become false

1630
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:43,360
now we do this thing called explanation closure an explanation closure basically means i'm going

1631
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:44,750
to add some formulas

1632
01:40:44,860 --> 01:40:48,650
and what these formulas capture is this common sense principle of inertia

1633
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:50,960
something should not change

1634
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:57,350
value function change value if it's not like explicitly mentioned in the effective action

1635
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:05,130
the flow into described in the following form called explanation closure actions in which several

1636
01:41:05,130 --> 01:41:06,690
local says

1637
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:07,770
it says that

1638
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:11,440
if the four f was false

1639
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:17,600
the the sort of politics is just the vector of possible arguments for my take

1640
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:18,650
so if the

1641
01:41:18,690 --> 01:41:24,560
if the if the flow was false but after performing some action it becomes true

1642
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:28,540
then of course positive conditions must have be true

1643
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:32,880
now wait for that to occur unless the positive conditions which

1644
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:34,290
similarly if

1645
01:41:34,310 --> 01:41:37,620
the flow was true but then it ended up becoming falls

1646
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:41,350
and that must be the cause the negative conditions which are

1647
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:47,720
now we can rewrite these if we rewrite then we see that there essentially disguised

1648
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:50,380
sort of frame axioms i rewrite the first one

1649
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:53,620
basically says well look if the flow was false

1650
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:56,540
and it's not the case that any of the

1651
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:59,100
conditions to make it true

1652
01:41:59,150 --> 01:42:01,020
i happen to be the case

1653
01:42:01,130 --> 01:42:03,920
and the thing states false

1654
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,630
OK so i've uses the contrapuntal that is

1655
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:10,130
this what the

1656
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:14,750
if you know the last two bits of the first four around

1657
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:18,790
and i've done that similarly to the second floor

1658
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:23,480
that's how we can improve these articles so similarly for the second formula just as

1659
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:25,940
it if the property was true

1660
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:29,130
and now the conditions that would make it false

1661
01:42:29,210 --> 01:42:33,560
we're realised that it remains true and that probably the mainstream

1662
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,600
so if the cap was white

1663
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:39,000
and there was no action is now

1664
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:48,040
condition under which you could changes colour then it's going to remain one

1665
01:42:48,730 --> 01:42:51,900
we might skip some of the because it turns out you gotta have a lot

1666
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:55,600
of other stuff so in logic this is another listen to draw from this

1667
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:59,560
you know this thing in real life things are really simple but in logic things

1668
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,500
become much much more complex

1669
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,130
so one thing you've got to do is you got to say that for instance

1670
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:08,150
you know these two whitecaps different and also on different from the one cup as

1671
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:12,880
because obviously this an interpretation under which means the white captured exactly the same thing

1672
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:15,730
so we've got to actually say that if you got a symbol that refers to

1673
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:16,710
an object

1674
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:22,730
you you got to make sure they used to distinguish it from other possible

1675
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:26,000
OK now it turns out that if you stick all of this stuff together you

1676
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,150
come up with a formula which looks like the following one and we're going to

1677
01:43:29,150 --> 01:43:32,080
call it the successor state axioms is one

1678
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:37,500
what the successor state axioms has noticed equivalent is this is the by implication

1679
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:41,290
the this formula tells us exactly under which conditions

1680
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:45,230
four fluid has the particular property after doing an action

1681
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:50,230
because it's an infinitely from that we can sort of see whether true

1682
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:52,790
but we go can also reason about when it is false

1683
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:55,440
so this essentially says that it

1684
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:56,710
is true

1685
01:43:56,730 --> 01:44:00,190
after doing action a precisely

1686
01:44:01,690 --> 01:44:03,940
the conditions to make it true

1687
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:09,650
it was true to begin with and under the conditions to make it false support

1688
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:11,250
i happen to be the case

1689
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:15,040
so setting just trying to

1690
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:19,810
explain in plain english something is true precisely when

1691
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:25,040
none of the conditions to make it falls happen to be the case

1692
01:44:25,810 --> 01:44:27,380
it was true to begin with

1693
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:30,580
and so was sorry

1694
01:44:30,580 --> 01:44:33,980
it becomes true if was the conditions to make it true in the case

1695
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,420
and all sorry it was truly begin with another commission to make false

1696
01:44:39,710 --> 01:44:41,330
well because

1697
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:44,250
so if we have a look at this particular example we see that

1698
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:49,810
we can say that x is broken after doing action a it precisely when

1699
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:54,420
either we did the drop action and it was fragile although exploded the bomb next

1700
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:58,350
to it all just happened to be broken to begin with and we didn't do

1701
01:44:58,350 --> 01:45:03,000
anything to make it not right

1702
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:07,400
this formula captures all the conditions to work out the value broken so can work

1703
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,540
out with the broken that something is true

1704
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:12,810
breaking of the white cap is true or can work out whether it's false once

1705
01:45:12,810 --> 01:45:14,380
we have this form

1706
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,290
and we get this form as i say by adding a couple of extra fullness

1707
01:45:17,290 --> 01:45:18,980
and what the extra farmers

1708
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,310
sort of

1709
01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:26,350
it is encoded this common-sense principle of inertia that something will retain its value

1710
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:32,980
if it's not as if it's not sort of describe the effects of the action

1711
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:36,960
i always think quite well under pressure from

1712
01:45:39,060 --> 01:45:44,150
you know the big thing is corrosion studies in the sea and you can see

1713
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:45,270
what what

1714
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:51,190
i am phases in the iron oxide is if intuitively if you for whatever faces

1715
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:53,020
there if few too

1716
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:57,350
that will show up in the raman spectrum quite easily you look at what's happening

1717
01:45:57,350 --> 01:46:02,170
with with the grain boundaries and it's like that because SEM

1718
01:46:02,170 --> 01:46:06,170
you're look even half my transport picamoles spot

1719
01:46:06,190 --> 01:46:12,290
the are some problems potential problems remember using a laser in vacuum

1720
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:16,980
so you heat dissipation was way samples are actually have potentially

1721
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:20,270
the honourable they will burn in here

1722
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:23,420
because he will not be dissipated of the sample

1723
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:25,370
thank you

1724
01:46:25,390 --> 01:46:38,520
now come on you know and i don't believe

1725
01:46:38,570 --> 01:46:43,580
the some they wanted when the going for lunch yes

1726
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:53,460
i did not know something this stupid question

1727
01:46:59,890 --> 01:47:07,060
so how do you not degrading because of

1728
01:47:12,170 --> 01:47:16,290
yes i know you

1729
01:47:16,330 --> 01:47:19,500
you know that is one of the advantage of using FM

1730
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,600
you can actually be scanned area into the dot is that you can watch the

1731
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,580
dots disappear

1732
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:28,120
if you're hitting number two much

1733
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:29,230
when you search

1734
01:47:29,230 --> 01:47:30,580
fact if i go back

1735
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:42,170
if you go back to

1736
01:47:42,230 --> 01:47:47,100
number one

1737
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:56,350
if you would

1738
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:58,640
if that those of the quantum dots

1739
01:47:58,660 --> 01:48:02,350
you analyzing if you

1740
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:05,140
are doing any damage at all

1741
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:08,100
you can very quickly that politics

1742
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:09,790
a few seconds to acquire

1743
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:10,750
that image

1744
01:48:10,770 --> 01:48:16,290
and because you you know the way you do this using imaging you just quickly

1745
01:48:16,290 --> 01:48:21,730
acquire that image and if you get degradation you see the support the disappear issue

1746
01:48:21,730 --> 01:48:25,080
right you have to be very careful all we're going to use you have to

1747
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:29,480
be very careful how much power years

1748
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,850
this is a beautiful picture

1749
01:48:31,870 --> 01:48:33,370
you could actually

1750
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:35,250
that takes

1751
01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:38,750
that takes longer to acquire then it would be to destroy

1752
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:40,670
that quantum dot

1753
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:42,580
you could start like quantum dot in

1754
01:48:44,370 --> 01:48:49,440
it's not necessary because the question the question is there because i believe me people

1755
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:53,710
have been right thing for all of a whole raft of quantum dots placed close

1756
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,870
analysis the head with a one micron laser spot

1757
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:02,690
we go by agreeing exactly no information at all

1758
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:04,230
and they go back

1759
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:05,670
of the site

1760
01:49:09,230 --> 01:49:10,830
scanned docs

1761
01:49:10,870 --> 01:49:19,310
as i said with all of this material united states

1762
01:49:19,330 --> 01:49:24,620
size tends to be going to become less and less sample preparation orientated trying to

1763
01:49:24,620 --> 01:49:27,620
make things simple when you start to do this kind of what

1764
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:28,920
it's not simple

1765
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:33,500
the sample preparation is an important understanding your model

1766
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:37,620
there's even more important and destroying model is very easy

1767
01:49:37,670 --> 01:49:44,810
you know this is not a panacea this is this is the media technology

1768
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:49,350
this is a beautiful

1769
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:52,230
if image this is a good

1770
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:53,560
rahman image

1771
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:56,330
and this is a very very nice

1772
01:49:56,330 --> 01:50:00,870
way profiles through that pillar

1773
01:50:00,890 --> 01:50:04,100
but this was done by people who have been doing this for probably about ten

1774
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:13,170
you know so if they've been always which leads to use but also which polarisation

1775
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:17,920
other ways to do music but how do you like your naturally polarized this i

1776
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,370
would say no

1777
01:50:19,370 --> 01:50:21,830
you was campbell is so that people

1778
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:25,890
so you're not going in engineering you can get some materials like this with the

1779
01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:30,140
polarized laser again around the signal at all

1780
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:31,960
because the point the

1781
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:37,620
elizabeth straight through the crystal plane you know reflect no deflection depolarized always you get

1782
01:50:37,620 --> 01:50:40,890
some you can name should the polarization of the laser

1783
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:45,870
to get the maximum raman signal back from the material hopefully hopefully not damage the

1784
01:50:45,870 --> 01:50:48,920
sample the same day

1785
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:11,290
yes basically if you have a combined romany FM

1786
01:51:11,310 --> 01:51:16,480
you do this two ways you can either take bfm stage amount just onto the

1787
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,670
the normal microscope stage

1788
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:23,670
or you have to be very fancy and have no money

1789
01:51:23,670 --> 01:51:29,870
what we call i don't actually do let me show you

1790
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:37,770
according to the two

1791
01:51:38,830 --> 01:51:43,750
this is this is an interface system

1792
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:45,040
that combines both

1793
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,500
this is the ritual spectrometer

1794
01:51:47,540 --> 01:51:48,810
seventy five

1795
01:51:48,830 --> 01:51:51,230
triple these three six four laser back

1796
01:51:51,230 --> 01:51:55,600
this is double system this is your

1797
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:57,040
if fact

1798
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:00,140
and here you have the standard

1799
01:52:00,170 --> 01:52:05,560
three space microscope for doing other experiments you can do it the other way around

1800
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:10,460
you could have a standard FM of the microscope here and then

1801
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:13,890
but a couple so you would have them both in public

1802
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:16,190
one after another so you have your

1803
01:52:16,190 --> 01:52:18,040
you if m here

1804
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:22,810
you have used and the microscope for you rahman here i knew spectrometer here on

1805
01:52:22,830 --> 01:52:24,540
just one the couple through

1806
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:26,440
if you find a couple

1807
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:29,210
you can then take of the fibre would come over here

1808
01:52:29,230 --> 01:52:31,350
and we go to the

1809
01:52:31,350 --> 01:52:32,790
if m

1810
01:52:32,810 --> 01:52:34,770
so you still have you stand alone running

1811
01:52:34,770 --> 01:52:38,730
and you can use them independently together

1812
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:39,540
we do it

1813
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:43,120
this wooden unless you specifically ask

1814
01:52:43,140 --> 01:52:44,140
to have

1815
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:47,400
just on the FM only system

1816
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:50,830
we automatically supply a stand-alone rama systems

1817
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:57,140
clearly FM in this case is directly coupled in the case of an onyx AFM

1818
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:59,000
it's five a couple

1819
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:01,980
so you do not using any of the
