1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,210
two players passed in succession then we can conclude that no none of the players

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,330
sees any value in continuing to play and so it's essentially an agreement to stop

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,530
playing and to count

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:21,600
now removing all the numbers here you see that blacks around this territory here all

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,410
the points marked by b

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,520
and white surrounded all the points marked by w here so you just count how

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,300
many bees there are and how many w there are you calculate the difference and

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,600
that's the amount by which one side one in this case

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,430
probably black one

10
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,090
now if it so happened that in the process of the games some stones were

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,630
captured then they also are added to the territorial account so if you capture stone

12
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,290
you pretty much get the territory point on which it was and you get that

13
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,360
x extra prison

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,850
so this is the this is the japanese way of counting this chinese way but

15
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,510
they are essentially equivalent

16
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,040
no they don't in the japanese rule set

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,250
that's correct you just can't empty territory

18
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,520
in fact what you do in practice is you know there are some black prisoners

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,400
that white

20
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,810
court and some white prisoners the black card and you just fill in the territory

21
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,090
with them so if lack lustre prisoner that means in the end he has to

22
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,270
put put prisoner into his own territory which

23
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,220
reduces the territory by the number of prisoners

24
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:51,160
that's correct yes so this is a certain amount of agreement at the end of

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,910
the game which travels people in computer go a lot because positions at the and

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,670
usually not play really play to the and so if white played stone here

27
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,190
then black what claims

28
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,240
well that's is that i could i could easily capture it

29
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,850
and what may then say OK that's right

30
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,890
and this the dispute will be settled are what i would say that the

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,450
you're blackstone's here i doubt my white stones alive and then

32
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,620
black would take up the challenge

33
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,110
and would start killing this

34
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,440
the white stone

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,110
why would have to continue played

36
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,580
and if y continues playing

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,300
he would either put stones into the black territory and increase the number of prisoners

38
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,650
for every stone that black place why would have to put prison in here of

39
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,820
why does one that he has to play into his own territory which also costs

40
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,240
one point each

41
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,250
so there's really no in this kind of proving at the end certain stones have

42
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,610
to prove that but it's it's a fair process is not that white can strip

43
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,190
of black in this way

44
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:07,820
it's a good observation it's a certain amount of negotiations going on at the end

45
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,940
of the game

46
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,110
so there's a few additional things

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,870
as you may have noticed in capture go as well as in real making the

48
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:24,250
first move helps so people realise that and there's something called call me which means

49
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:31,050
that white receives a certain number of black prisoners before the game even starts to

50
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,190
compensate for the fact that black start play

51
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,130
now usually this is chosen the fractional manner so as to provide a service to

52
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,240
make sure that there will be a winner at the end because it this chosen

53
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,430
fractionally then there cannot be a a tie at the end people are not entirely

54
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,610
they don't entirely agree what this number should be so how much advantage is for

55
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:59,580
playing first and it ranges between four point five and eight point five stones

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,980
there's another very nice property which is referred to as the handicap system in goal

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,700
so often we have the situation that two players might want to play but they

58
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,760
are of different playing strength

59
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:17,060
and in go there's very elegant system of dealing with that because the weaker player

60
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:22,400
is allowed to to make a certain number of moves before the stronger player starts

61
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,580
it means the moment that i make a

62
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,640
any smaller than one and a half centimeters there's no propagation anymore in that direction

63
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,120
because now i can no longer meets the boundary conditions

64
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,090
for kx and i will demonstrate that as i did

65
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,140
before this is not the first time

66
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,590
that you will see that

67
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,340
before i do that

68
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,500
i want to discuss the issue the meaning now of an equal nancy equals two

69
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,990
what does that mean

70
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,230
in other words

71
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,570
we had here the

72
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,890
n equals one

73
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,260
we also have nancy equals two

74
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,710
so i'm going to make a new plot because it becomes otherwise two club

75
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,500
i leave this all make sure you get that sequence that's very important

76
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,510
and i will

77
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,810
put up later again

78
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,810
so i'm going to make a new plot

79
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,430
otherwise it becomes

80
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,630
two confusing to many lines casey

81
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,950
here is your

82
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,030
o line on this dispersion omega psi times

83
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,890
k of c

84
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,400
we are now

85
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,100
sure and equals one

86
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,390
omega c

87
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,200
because by

88
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,290
divided by a time c

89
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,290
and here exactly

90
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,470
twice as high

91
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,450
is an equals two

92
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,450
by another omega c

93
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,030
is two pi

94
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,530
i'm seeing

95
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,170
divided by a

96
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,320
so i have one line here

97
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,890
and i have another line here

98
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,870
so this is now

99
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,430
the plot of this equation for any one and independently for and

100
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,780
equals two

101
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,610
so this is an equals one

102
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,540
and this is an ecosystem

103
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,740
so imagine that this is our omega

104
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,170
that is the given that's the one that we

105
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,780
i happen to have

106
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,450
this frequency can obviously go through the gap

107
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,380
but now it has the choice out of two possibilities

108
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,470
it can either go through this way

109
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,480
with this value for case

110
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,100
which corresponds was an equals two

111
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,250
that's the most in green there

112
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,220
or it can go through

113
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,040
in this mode with this value for casey

114
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,470
for n equals one or it can do both

115
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,210
it can do any linear combination between

116
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,930
these two because each one is the solution

117
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,690
two maxwell's equations one o based the boundary condition on each one meets the

118
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,970
brief equation

119
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,470
so no two ways it can go through

120
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,290
if it decides to choose this route then kx is together

121
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,800
is by over a if it's

122
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,710
so decides to go this way

123
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,610
and k x is two pi over the only difference between these two is that

124
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,980
kx is different k is not different

125
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,040
because of the same omega

126
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,250
if the same omega have the same k the same wavelength

127
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,810
but this one has a different k of x therefore different k scales e

128
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,420
you see that

129
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,870
and this one has a different k of x therefore different value

130
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,120
for k of c

131
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,610
i cannot be

132
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,070
before i want to demonstrate to you which is repeat

133
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,290
but if i have here electromagnetic radiation three

134
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,130
centimetre wait all arise in this direction

135
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,590
i'm going to send to days receiver which can we see it

136
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,190
if i'm going to demonstrate that when i make the gets smaller than one and

137
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:09,270
a half centimeters that all of the sudden disappearance radiation

138
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,380
before i do that

139
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,110
i want to ask you a question which is important you can test whether u

140
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,970
i understand this concept

141
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,170
my radiation is linearly polarized in this direction

142
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,790
i love that came all this misery

143
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,630
is there a way that i can send electromagnetic radiation through that gap

144
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,090
when the gap

145
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,090
for my transmitter is smaller than one and a half sentence

146
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,800
i know i cannot do it

147
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:45,310
what is polarized this direction will immediately disappear you'll hear that is the way that

148
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,430
i can still get radiation through

149
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:54,790
when the opening of the gap is smaller than one and a half standard

150
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,150
i realize that

151
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,030
they take you a little bit of time

152
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,220
we think of it

153
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,820
two by saying

154
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,310
all these misery is the consequence of the fact that i chose

155
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:12,120
the direction of linear polarization in the y direction

156
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,010
if i exactly

157
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,470
if i put in

158
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,440
and i will do that believe me

159
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,290
if i rotate

160
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,000
my transmitted by ninety degrees

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,020
and i sense in radiation

162
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,680
by vector

163
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,490
is linearly polarized in the x direction

164
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:36,010
there is no misery at all because all boundary conditions will always be met by

165
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,150
mother nature

166
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,440
because all that mother nature has to do

167
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,470
is to make sure that the normal component

168
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,920
at the conductor

169
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,490
sigma as divided by actually non-zero so all you have to do is rearrange the

170
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,610
charges on the surface but nothing has ever to go to zero

171
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,980
so the moment that i make the radiation polarized in this direction there is no

172
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,130
the phrase velocities c

173
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,010
the group velocity is c

174
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,500
and this is the line

175
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,180
that holds no

176
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,030
it's only the component in the y direction to give his misery

177
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,230
that's very interesting isn't it

178
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,950
because what that means that

179
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,870
what that means is that if the radiation

180
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,540
that use and then

181
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,680
however component both in the in the

182
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,020
both in the y in the x direction

183
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,800
i can do that right i can send radiation through

184
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,530
that is linearly polarized that this

185
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,600
and something unbelievable is going to happen

186
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,290
the component in the x direction will go straight through is the speed of light

187
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,720
and the component in the y direction has to suffer like this

188
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,860
and so to completely decouple

189
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,930
thirty x direction is not this specific group velocity phase velocity c

190
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,600
a different kind of book

191
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,760
the carbon

192
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,610
where mathematics come from asking the embodied mind

193
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,820
it brings mathematics into being

194
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,910
and the reason for doing in the book

195
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,710
mathematics is not built into the universe

196
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,970
so we're not taking in this

197
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,910
o point of view that out there someplace guy

198
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,910
the park

199
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,200
mathematics has a human face

200
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,620
i went to the world and they would have chosen a better picture for the

201
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,480
front of the book there something that reminds me the students

202
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,740
and then that would be more whole

203
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,950
there's too much like

204
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:46,760
he is a professor of linguistics and he has been involved in every modern every

205
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,820
modern trend in linguistics over over many years i know well

206
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,940
is this idea that you should look at the role

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,100
both in linguistics and

208
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,250
i think the quality

209
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,690
politics two so that works

210
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,150
but would

211
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,910
the former

212
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,040
this is the main title of the book i think

213
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,220
it is very good at making up the catchy

214
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:24,420
we have this quality here

215
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,880
who came from the so-called

216
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,550
really based on

217
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,850
and serious

218
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,330
metaphor and the development of mathematical concepts

219
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,290
and they go through many examples

220
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,170
rather elementary

221
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,080
but still very seriously tried to think

222
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:51,950
well the mathematical concept come from and to try to trace back some from the

223
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,690
in the

224
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,020
none of the american mathematical society v

225
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,040
order in which states

226
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,130
i would point out

227
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,990
after we try to understand

228
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,190
about them

229
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:20,450
that was a member of

230
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,190
because it connects up with the way intuitions

231
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,440
but i think it is fair criticism that if you're going to perform

232
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,360
oppose i like that

233
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,950
and to make it into theory

234
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,340
the ideas come about

235
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,920
you have to be

236
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,430
much more exact much more rigorous about

237
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,740
i think that the criticism they may be good stuff

238
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,990
but they would be much more to be said about

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,140
this is

240
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,670
i did

241
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,040
many others

242
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,110
it is a slippery slope

243
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,590
and i was reminded of the famous quotation from got

244
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,590
mathematicians like frenchmen

245
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,590
what happens to them they translated into all language

246
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,140
something different

247
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:24,710
so we have the resources to consider the problem of these definitions and so what

248
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,280
because you have lots of

249
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,620
difficulties with newton's colours and so on and so

250
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,390
i think he was perhaps prejudiced against mathematician

251
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,860
this email

252
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:46,750
this which has one of the most people the first one is called the foundations

253
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,070
of mathematics FOM less

254
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,270
and he argued that people therefore

255
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,470
almost a couple of years on the map

256
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,670
this is called the edge would

257
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,450
which is by invitation

258
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,140
MIT based intellectuals

259
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,110
they they discussed many topics so you can search on those lists for

260
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,630
the interesting ideas thing about has to find

261
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,320
the holy

262
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:24,260
interesting point of view which combines

263
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,690
the thing about

264
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,280
cognitive science

265
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,670
these things and so he also feels that

266
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,090
through hasn't found a way of making

267
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:39,880
randomly but you assume that the data is sampled

268
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,150
i i d so independently

269
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,250
with the same distribution from something

270
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,900
i noticed an unknown distribution

271
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,000
in the transactional framework

272
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,170
we assume that the data is completely fixed but what is one of is houses

273
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,820
is data into

274
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,670
no labelled and unlabelled

275
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,690
and the law you can just read that

276
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,040
the point is is data generation

277
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,860
assumption tell you how you assume that the data comes

278
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,730
now the protocol

279
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,380
i mean mainly it's you know whether the data

280
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,540
all that time like you get all the examples

281
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,540
once for all that offline space or online you get one example at a time

282
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,860
along the way

283
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,610
how the example can't you have some other

284
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,630
things that define the protocol which is you know how

285
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,040
we define the error you're the reason or

286
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,590
whether you

287
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:46,150
i mean whether you are available to you here or the value of the year

288
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,270
so if you are function of the body of the body of a year or

289
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,790
the year of

290
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,060
related upgrades

291
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,580
i mean this will be probably when you

292
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,770
calls lecture online learning

293
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,360
and i will get into the details here

294
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,670
just to give you an idea

295
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,630
success measures

296
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,440
and will also to define the success

297
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,340
one classical one expected error the offline setting

298
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,580
where you take the average air and there is no distribution

299
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:22,210
the cumulative error is like

300
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,960
the some of the air jamaica every step in the online learning case

301
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,750
and you can have

302
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,730
a combination of both if you have an underlying probability consumption so if you assume

303
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,940
that the example

304
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,230
one at the time and they are sampled from some distribution you can compute the

305
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,210
expected value of the officer

306
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,060
now the type of analysis

307
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,250
this is what you can do a four

308
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,590
or how you want to find

309
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,730
what is a good idea to more about it

310
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,750
you can study in the worst case

311
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,110
from performance or the average case

312
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,060
the worst case being right

313
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,920
you consider the worst possible data generation mechanism was

314
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,020
the one that you have chosen

315
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,560
or average cases like you know

316
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,230
you find some kind of probability all the the third generation mechanism you you take

317
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,500
the average over them

318
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,960
so it requires some waiting like

319
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,980
using how what is the probability of each

320
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,060
the third generation

321
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,270
probability distribution

322
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:29,460
all these schemes which is that you are interested in the case that you

323
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,340
and then you can prove several different things even

324
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,540
i mean for tour of each type of analysis

325
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,630
OK so one example that we can

326
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,770
it's a little bit more is a bayesian inference and i'm i'm using that in

327
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,630
kind of very general

328
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:54,270
and i mean many people would have different definitions or would only consider

329
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,590
the protocol but not the digital data generation mechanism and so on so

330
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,940
i'm trying to

331
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,610
goes through all these things that have defined

332
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,170
tell you what would be

333
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,940
the way

334
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,710
people with the innovation

335
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,630
so as i said before the data generation mechanism of bayesian inferences

336
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,920
if you assume that your function is sampled from some prior

337
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,520
and the data sample i i d

338
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,310
so are from the prior distribution and labeled by function

339
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,480
depends on whether you consider function this

340
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:37,130
the probability is often offline you you see all the example that twenty

341
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,170
and the last major is expected error and there

342
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,460
this the third generation mechanism

343
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,900
and the type of analysis is again

344
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,500
your average things under the prior

345
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,770
it's kind of fun

346
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,380
average case analysis

347
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,880
and usually also

348
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,040
restrictive assumptions like you assume that the noise officers this evening before like in the

349
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:06,500
a regression based on regression you would assume that the noises captionologist

350
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:14,540
well i mean usually you assume that

351
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,980
each instance

352
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,000
is simple independently

353
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,840
from some distribution so i mean that's what might

354
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,340
well it's not very clear so

355
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,750
they usually have a different prior from the data or

356
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,340
something to beat up

357
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,480
but there are two ways either

358
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,340
you consider function

359
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,170
you sample your data and then use labeled data with the function or you consider

360
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,540
so the diffusion of XY

361
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,150
and then the data is just from x y so it's not labelled by the

362
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:05,630
OK maybe this is a special case i special just because

363
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:10,920
like some people would just say OK i get time example from some distribution

364
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,580
which need not be i i d

365
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,690
and four

366
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,940
all these assumptions you only need if you want to put things

367
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,230
otherwise you can

368
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,460
well so if you want to apply bayes rule that you have to

369
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,840
she was whether

370
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,650
you want to write the probability of the observation as the product of

371
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:36,170
probabilities of individual observations which the eighty or you

372
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,790
we define this otherwise

373
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,560
OK so

374
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,340
in our case we will

375
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,920
more of the worst case analysis and we try to avoid assumptions that as much

376
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,040
as we can

377
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,710
and and look for others and that the best under

378
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,890
this only god

379
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,400
we call the angular

380
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,560
don't confuse it with angular velocity

381
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,820
recall angular frequency and the units are the same

382
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,760
units are in radians

383
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,790
a second

384
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,870
same as angular velocity

385
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,070
if i advance this time little t

386
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,800
if i advance that

387
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,710
two pi

388
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,620
divided by omega

389
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,300
if i advance this time by two pi divided by omega than this angle here

390
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,830
increases by two pi radians

391
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,250
which is three hundred sixty degrees and so that's the time it takes forty oscillation

392
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,910
to repeat itself

393
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,310
so this is the period of the oscillations

394
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,040
and that is in seconds

395
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,670
and you can determine if you want to you can define the frequency of the

396
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,080
oscillations which is one of the key

397
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,820
which we express always in terms of hertz

398
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,150
and then here we have what we call

399
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,580
the phase angle

400
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,750
i will return to that that scene radiance

401
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,720
and this

402
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,090
trial functions

403
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,750
i'm going to substitute now

404
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,670
into this equation

405
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,560
so the first thing i have to do i have to find what the

406
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,450
second derivative this

407
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,270
of x as a function

408
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,850
that's my function

409
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,280
i have here

410
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,780
first the

411
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,800
the first derivative x not

412
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,670
that becomes minus eight

413
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,470
omega i omega omega because there's a time

414
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,740
now i have to take the derivative of the function itself

415
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,440
so i get the sign

416
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,670
of omega t

417
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,170
plus five

418
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,760
of course i could have started off he was assigned curve i hope you realize

419
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,970
that just pick the cosine law

420
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,410
accidental or not

421
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,740
now i get another omega out so i get minus eight

422
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:58,880
omega script the derivative of the sine and cosine

423
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,410
omega key

424
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,930
and that is also

425
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,280
omega square

426
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:10,510
times x because notice i have a cosine omega t plus five

427
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,910
which itself is x

428
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,160
so now i'm ready to substitute this result

429
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,160
in two that differential equation

430
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,790
this must always hold

431
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,570
for any value of x for any moment in time

432
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,170
and therefore the only way

433
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,760
this can work is if only queries k of RAM

434
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,810
omega square must be

435
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,310
o friends

436
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,330
and therefore

437
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,430
we now have the solution

438
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,020
so this problem

439
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,130
so we have

440
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,950
equals the square

441
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,690
of k over and under period is two pi

442
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,820
times the square root

443
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,670
over k

444
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,780
and what is this striking really remarkable

445
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,890
that is independent of the amplitude

446
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,570
and it's also independent of this angle

447
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,760
five this phase angle what is this business of this phase angle

448
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,180
it's a peculiar thing that we have there

449
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,240
well you can think about the physics actually

450
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,700
when i started this also nation

451
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,520
i have a choice

452
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,830
one of two things i can start off at a certain position

453
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,660
which i can choose i can give it a certain displacement from zero and simply

454
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,090
let it go

455
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,290
but i can also and i let it go

456
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,630
give it a certain velocity that's my choice so i have two choices where i

457
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,510
let it go

458
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,240
and what philosophy i give it

459
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:37,210
and that is reflected in my solution namely that ultimately in the solution i get

460
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,940
the result of a and the result of y

461
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,580
which doesn't determine the period but

462
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,920
it results from what we call my initial conditions

463
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,930
and i want to

464
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,340
do an example

465
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,630
by you see how

466
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,670
a and phi

467
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,190
immediately follow

468
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,250
from the initial conditions

469
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,390
so in this example

470
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,030
i release the object at x equals zero

471
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,800
t equals zero so i release it at equilibrium

472
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,550
at that moment in time

473
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,030
i given the velocity

474
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:12,250
which is minus three meters per second units always the MKS units

475
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,350
the spring constant k

476
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,350
equal to ten newtons per meter

477
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,040
and the mass of the object

478
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,490
is o point one kilogram

479
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:25,010
and now i can ask you what now if x as a function of time

480
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,420
basic structure OK

481
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:32,910
in the systems that have been built to do this we can model acoustic observations

482
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,860
basically is gaussian mixtures

483
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,190
just as we can design hybrid

484
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:44,490
hidden markov model neural network speech recognizers we can do the same here

485
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,800
we can

486
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:50,230
also model the distinctive feature state process

487
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,180
as these higher using these hierarchy

488
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,260
hierarchical conditional probability tables

489
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:01,170
and this is the key thing here is this allows for a synchronous asynchrony

490
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,150
among feature variables

491
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:07,640
when training set static neural networks we were limited in

492
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,780
the asynchrony we could allow

493
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,450
between the features but now

494
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:19,500
we can basically assume that these are sort of the hidden states in this type

495
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,560
of system

496
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:27,520
having done that we can also implement a embedded training procedure we start off by

497
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:36,350
the parameters or they can the conditional probabilities basically along the edges of this graph

498
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,640
using phone alignments converted to feature values as i discussed earlier

499
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:48,570
we could use this as an initial condition to generate new alignments that are and

500
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,180
retrain with these realign transcriptions

501
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,860
much the same as you do

502
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,460
for those of you who are familiar with the training processes in hmms as professor

503
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:07,420
i described you can basically train train your parameters align your data with the this

504
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:12,970
this model and then retrain and realigned so and that's basically what we mean by

505
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,980
better training and that's what this sort of facilitates

506
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,930
so it allows then four

507
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,990
i guess you might say the truth

508
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:31,430
labels associated with the difference that distinctive features to move around

509
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,190
with respect to one another

510
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,980
the it turns out that the embedded training part didn't have a big effect on

511
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:47,360
phone accuracy when they use this sort of system for for doing for recognition by

512
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,350
there there was they were able to observe and they spend a a good deal

513
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,260
of effort sort of analysing this this issue

514
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:03,190
the asynchronously asynchrony among feature really worth representative i guess of what you would expect

515
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,910
to see

516
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,570
amongst you know the

517
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,930
i take it you know the the relationship amongst the articulators in actual speech

518
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,030
speech production so

519
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,610
so i think the

520
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:21,890
this the underlying take away message is that you have something that operates on a

521
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:26,710
little bit more close then there a bit closer to

522
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,850
the way the underlying articulatory system operates but

523
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:40,690
it just in their experiments that didn't have a translate to better phone recognition accuracy

524
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,260
OK so

525
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:53,650
the issue is how can we actually incorporates this distinctive feature knowledge into

526
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,130
model the SR model structure that we're all familiar with

527
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,930
so suppose you've got serious our system that's sitting on the shelf and you worked

528
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,570
very hard in the thing

529
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,950
and it's it's out there in the open source community in written documentation and you

530
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,470
don't want to throw it all away

531
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:15,590
that's actually not the motivation here but but the the idea is is what can

532
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,710
we do

533
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,640
to incorporate some model structure into into our existing so i'm sorry if this think

534
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,510
the feature model structure into our existing systems

535
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,950
what's a good example

536
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:30,320
for those of you who are familiar with this hierarchical

537
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,350
decision tree approaches for

538
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:39,020
training for coming up with the acoustic context

539
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,040
four context specific models in ASR think professor and i talk about that on monday

540
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,860
but the basically those things are driven

541
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,410
categorical predictors

542
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,750
and those predictors are generally

543
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,240
they are often

544
00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:01,750
based on the sort of the questions that are asked in in do splitting up

545
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,670
your data

546
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,550
are generally

547
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,240
correspond to

548
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,780
i particular articulatory phonology

549
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,230
so you could say

550
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,990
you know you i mean this might be a stretch for purest but you could

551
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,850
say that in that sense

552
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,450
there is some sort of articulatory knowledge

553
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:27,780
in designing the in designing areas are system they occur the acoustic context clustering that's

554
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,410
performed is

555
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,380
articulatory based

556
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:35,500
OK so there's an example

557
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,640
but we have some more exotic examples here one where the HMM state space

558
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:47,220
it is actually designed pretty much by hand so that the model topology

559
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:55,070
it's sort of describes feature spreading each state really is representative of an articulatory configurations

560
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:59,530
another another

561
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:06,850
example is where we can actually design our pronunciation dictionary so that it's based on

562
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:16,940
distinctive feature bundles and we actually have a way of describing pronunciation variability in terms

563
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,810
of the asynchrony of our distinctive features

564
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,230
and finally i give an example here where people have actually implemented this landmark distinctive

565
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:34,160
me to six of distinctive feature based model of speech perception in ASR we talked

566
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,940
about that

567
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,770
in the first part where we

568
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:41,880
models of speech perception in terms of sort of anchoring ourselves with these landmarks and

569
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,150
then discovering hughes

570
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,690
and figuring out

571
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,520
how those lined up with our lexicon

572
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,670
so here's an idea that

573
00:32:52,710 --> 00:33:00,040
leading and dunson did while he was still at waterloo the idea here is is

574
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,620
we're going to define the state space

575
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,670
now to chemical techniques

576
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,100
the distance the

577
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,000
can easily be made a thousand times smaller than

578
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,740
and if the distance is a thousand times smaller than you would get a capacitance

579
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,750
of one

580
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,540
thousands might refer

581
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,080
compared with your

582
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,590
which is only seven on the microphone array

583
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,870
so the capacitor like this

584
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,290
one thousand micro for

585
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,250
we bring potential difference over here

586
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,090
and we get a tremendous amount of charge shown here

587
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,490
in fact if i hold in my hands

588
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,810
and if i assume that the potential difference between my left hand on my right

589
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,540
he spent many faults

590
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,810
and i would bring on this capacitor

591
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,420
ten micro cool

592
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,940
that is an tremendous amount of charge

593
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,670
in fact on microkernel is the maximum charge we can ever put on the big

594
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,190
event the graph we calculated last time if we put more on the then the

595
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,160
graph goes into discharge

596
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,610
by simply holding this in my hands

597
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,740
i could ten my control here on this pattern

598
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,170
now you may say well

599
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,810
potential difference between your right and left hand nearly falls isn't that funny

600
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,450
no not really

601
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:22,440
in the future i will give lecture and discuss electrocardiography and you will see them

602
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,100
that there is a potential difference between the left side of your body on the

603
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,010
right side

604
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,580
which is several medical not artificial

605
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,500
as you

606
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
you may think

607
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,280
i will take a chordiogram in class you can see it really working

608
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,470
how much energy

609
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,410
can i stored in a capacitor

610
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,340
we already calculated that

611
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:50,350
we had the energy is the

612
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,320
this was the

613
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,010
the capacity one f q v

614
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,420
and we can now substitute for

615
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,160
we can substitute in their the capacitance c

616
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,050
and the

617
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,510
c is q divided by p

618
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,220
and so this is also

619
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,630
one half

620
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,680
the square and this one and the same thing

621
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,570
so you take the charge on the capacitor

622
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,150
multiplied by p

623
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,050
or you take back multiplied by

624
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,090
these crazy

625
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,810
the capacitance is never a function of the charge that has only of

626
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,330
you here

627
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,930
that is only a matter geometry

628
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,390
you there

629
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,090
a capacitor is only a matter of geometry never

630
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,400
because the charge

631
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,230
show up in there

632
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:46,100
so i mentioned that i can bring can micro

633
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,470
cool on this

634
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,380
and yet on the vendor graph

635
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:54,400
i can also only bring ten michael cool that's the maximum i can do before

636
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,330
it goes into to break down

637
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:59,980
we can think of the capacitor as a device that can store

638
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,790
electric energy

639
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,380
i will now return

640
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,080
my promise

641
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,560
i was going to demonstrate to you

642
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,580
i have to do positive work when i create electric fields in other words

643
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,570
when i take

644
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,430
two charged plates

645
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,810
and i bring them further away from each other

646
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,760
that i do positive work

647
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,300
and how am i going to show that you

648
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,330
i have

649
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:29,990
two parallel plates on the table they are going to see them shortly

650
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,140
projected there

651
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,230
we have here

652
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,620
currently there are more eighteen therefore

653
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,390
currently there

654
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,770
and i'm going to

655
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,240
the power supply

656
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,650
and what the potential difference over here

657
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,830
this is the capacitance c we normally

658
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,840
use for capacitor symbol of two parallel

659
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,040
o lines

660
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,070
i'm going to put a potential difference

661
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:01,150
over the past two of thousands fal let me put down here to remind you

662
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,610
that the difference

663
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,790
between the two plates

664
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,060
as i do that

665
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,370
as i connect the power supply

666
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,050
these two ends

667
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:15,100
charge will flow on you and so you will see very short search of current

668
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,480
and neither give you only for a short amount of time charging which

669
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,380
was you

670
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,630
i will show you that is

671
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,590
charts flow and you will see that but that's not really the goal of my

672
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,070
what i'm now going to do

673
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,490
it is i'm not going to increase

674
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,880
the separation

675
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,100
the distance d

676
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,070
of these two plates

677
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,550
and remember that the potential difference over the past over the

678
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:45,140
plates which i call now capacitor is the electric field

679
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:50,000
and this is an electric field is constant if i charge the capacitor up with

680
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,950
this so can charge there is less skew here

681
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:58,090
minus q there and then i removed the power supply is no longer there that

682
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,590
charges trap charged can never change and so

683
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,490
all right so

684
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,210
we're gonna

685
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,100
move on

686
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,050
since i heard echoes the the lecture yes they might have been too easy is

687
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,090
going to be some more equations today

688
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:19,170
not that many after

689
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,290
just to set the scene

690
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,920
i'm going to remind you of of

691
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:33,620
very rough categorisation of the kinds of machine learning that one can do all right

692
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,520
it's not like to take a vote here

693
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:43,760
who thinks his doing or she's doing mainly supervised learning

694
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,750
all right

695
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,340
you're allowed to vote twice by way who thinks that he or she is doing

696
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,190
mainly unsupervised learning

697
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,710
all right bit less

698
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:58,940
sure you can vote tries to find

699
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,520
one of the previous one

700
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:03,110
that's fine

701
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,110
and who's doing reinforcement learning

702
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,270
another man

703
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,600
all right so

704
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,930
i'm not going to say

705
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:16,660
anything about reinforcement learning in any of the slides it follows if i i'd rather

706
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,960
do it now then

707
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:26,290
risk for reinforcement learning first from supervised and unsupervised learning in very interesting ways

708
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,850
in reinforcement learning you can think about it as

709
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,910
you can think about it as the child learning from its environment anyway

710
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,740
so the thing is

711
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,470
instead of instead of giving

712
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,990
your algorithm

713
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:45,610
dataset some inputs and some targets and saying you from this here's the cost function

714
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:49,220
you have to minimize and i'm going to ask you to make predictions

715
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,550
in reinforcement learning you give

716
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,440
the algorithm

717
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,020
a reward function is sort of say

718
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,470
whenever you get things right how you can be and whatever you get things wrong

719
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,160
sort of hit you with a stick

720
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,210
all right and it doesn't really know about the environment to much so it interacts

721
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,650
with OK i give you an example that have that i've been working on and

722
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,420
i think it's one that

723
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:15,620
i think is one that can actually talk about

724
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,170
so so

725
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:22,860
has any who played racing games with with cars on on the computer

726
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,140
i you very good

727
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:31,190
this is i think the most challenging of the most exciting thing for the user

728
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:35,460
is actually going to play online against other players right in racing game that you

729
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,750
play against the computer

730
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:39,610
i don't know how how often i think you are about

731
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:44,020
racing games fairly fine i think about them and you see that the computer drives

732
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,430
in the very very strange way there's many things that are deeply disturbing about the

733
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,020
way the computer drives OK

734
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,810
and actually sort of know how the AI has been for for for the other

735
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:56,460
consonants so the thing is

736
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,030
because they follow perfect lines they don't they don't like humans and where they don't

737
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,500
feel like humans and it's fairly boring most of the time the drug against a

738
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,950
what we've done is we've sort of set a certain set of rules to the

739
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,810
car and we said well you know you have to achieve the shortest

740
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,050
lap time possible OK

741
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:17,400
and here's the things you can do can accelerate you can race against here and

742
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,810
so on now go on and and do the best lap time you can do

743
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,210
so that's that's reinforcement learning task and then of course in the first let's just

744
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,490
crushes all over the place

745
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,240
but little by little it learns it writes things so basically it also has to

746
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,210
acquire a data set in a way as it was it works OK under the

747
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:39,200
trade off between exploring the environment which is useful for the future and not and

748
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,920
sort of exploiting

749
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,120
the little knowledge i have to to go towards the goal

750
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:47,430
so that was it for sportsmen going to say any more about it

751
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,900
what we're going to talk about today is

752
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,390
only unsupervised learning

753
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:56,240
so i think i already asked yesterday but

754
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,460
it might be worth

755
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,610
asking again

756
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:04,230
who's ever implemented k means

757
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,890
all right that's very good

758
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:11,140
who's ever implemented mixtures of gaussians

759
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,330
it's also good

760
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:15,670
all right

761
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,470
and who has ever implemented factor analysis

762
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,800
OK nobody has

763
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,250
i'll tell you a bit about it

764
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:39,930
so let's think about some datasets that that one could

765
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,190
what can think of

766
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:49,760
this data set here in our two datasets where i would

767
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,740
go on want to model the input density for example

768
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,230
so do some

769
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,130
unsupervised learning on them

770
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,660
this data set here

771
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,750
is that where would sort of do

772
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,300
supervised learning do sort of supervised binary classification

773
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,140
i a bit about this data set this episode was collected by iain murray

774
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,970
who was a student at the gatsby unit

775
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,440
i was actually very recently finishes his

776
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:18,280
and he went out in london and he bought

777
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,310
a set of different oranges and lemons

778
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,160
and then he measured the height and width of each of them and he actually

779
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,350
measured all the features as well

780
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,380
and then just place points in the in the plane according to the height and

781
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,280
width and he thought that that was sort of

782
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:41,560
exciting data set of more exciting than just drawing samples from from the girls

783
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,660
OK so

784
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,370
if you

785
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,230
if you were to model

786
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,740
density in

787
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:53,800
in one d what we do

788
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,190
anyone so

789
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:00,010
the histogram

790
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:08,180
it's it's just sort of dots on so you have x

791
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,000
and then you observe some

792
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,880
we observe some values

793
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,430
and you want to infer

794
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,250
you know you want to sort of modern density

795
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,140
but in windows yes

796
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,870
but all good old stuff

797
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,480
i mean

798
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,440
i don't know why nobody said you know just try to fit goes into the

799
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:33,120
now that so much

800
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:38,810
OK let's just remind ourselves briefly of the good old gaussian distribution so you can

801
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,880
sort of see i call data x let's call y wife now

802
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,040
and probably going to be swapping between x and y

803
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:54,420
sort of familiar with the with the equation for the for the girls and in

804
00:44:54,420 --> 00:45:00,050
one b has two parameters are right

805
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:05,050
OK so let's talk about the right these things and so the dependence

806
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:08,340
jim watson

807
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,040
future data

808
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,780
topic proportions

809
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,190
four sparsity

810
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,550
the bayesian machinery

811
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:35,200
which is

812
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,010
you could run interesting picture

813
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,730
and laura something

814
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,650
you know

815
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:19,120
i think

816
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,000
OK so

817
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:41,900
i also missed

818
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:44,490
first the current

819
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:51,620
and what you said also relates to sparsity it sounds like you're talking about putting

820
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,660
dirichlet prior on beta

821
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,830
OK that's that's probably true that sparsity helps matters but i should tell you that

822
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,390
these topics were fit with maximum likelihood on the

823
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,010
we still got this

824
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:07,790
but i think these are all good points but if there's a more in

825
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:10,340
you will see

826
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,870
so was

827
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:32,670
the structure that the i wanted to not confuse order ordering bag of words which

828
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:34,690
is why translator structure but

829
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,840
i mean to say what you said

830
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,530
so i think

831
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:52,490
i don't know

832
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:08,450
well this i don't know if if if the idea is that the number of

833
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,110
topics here to fifty

834
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:15,080
i did i did strike the right balance carefully like i cook somewhere cook

835
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:20,640
i put some chili pepper and it tastes like chili peppers

836
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:29,490
came out but

837
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,800
but you're right that there's something about balance

838
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:34,950
that's right balance again

839
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:41,740
that is this is good so remember this feeling of thinking about the posterior when

840
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:49,540
building and analyzing your next hierarchical bayesian model for whatever it is these are important

841
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,670
intuitions to start to

842
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:56,490
to foster i think and i think that's

843
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:00,390
i don't have like a good answer for this question but

844
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,550
i think we've had on a lot of in and my intuitions

845
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,640
i tried to write them down

846
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:10,880
i the wrong way

847
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,770
here are my random thoughts that so why does LDA posterior put topical words together

848
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:24,780
one is that the word probabilities are maximized by dividing the words among the top

849
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,040
what i mean by that is that

850
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,660
let's recall the

851
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:43,800
the joint distribution

852
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:53,790
that's right hard

853
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:55,160
i think

854
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:02,780
so let's say we have the product over documents to assume the topics are fixed

855
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:09,790
we're going to fit the topics that maximize the product over documents the given alpha

856
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:12,260
product of words

857
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:16,380
the topic assignment data

858
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,820
thirty words

859
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,120
and then the fear

860
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,400
the here

861
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:38,000
the OK so this is this is the joint distribution of the hidden and observed

862
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,240
random variables going to play a role in we're doing inference

863
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:49,540
this is proportional to the posterior distribution that i'm asking you to think about

864
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:54,570
right so everyone is everyone see that the proportion that the posterior is you've probably

865
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:58,500
seen for five times already is proportional to the joint distribution of the hidden in

866
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:03,550
the observed variables divided by the evidence the probability of the observed variables with everything

867
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,430
had marginalized out

868
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,690
OK so this is proportional to the posterior and

869
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,420
one thought experiment is

870
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:18,060
what happen what keeps us from putting the all of the words with equal probability

871
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:23,890
or probability proportional to how often they occur in the corpus into each topic

872
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:28,040
right what keeps us from doing that what keeps us from from member the data

873
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:33,760
so here's here topic k

874
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:37,650
and here's the word the

875
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:43,510
and and the sum to one what keeps us from putting the same distribution over

876
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:48,110
words in each of these topics

877
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,190
this is

878
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:58,810
OK that's right that's one aspect of the prior that keeps us from doing that

879
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:02,070
so if we have a sparse prior on the bathers then that's not gonna happen

880
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:06,310
but even if we do ML maximum likelihood of the data is we're not going

881
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:11,090
to want to do that and the reason is that we are drawing the words

882
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:13,540
those banners the likelihood term

883
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,180
going it easy to

884
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:19,440
to be obsessed with properties of prior

885
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:23,450
properties of the likelihood term are extremely important as well

886
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:29,260
the likelihood term says that the words have probability equal to whatever the probability of

887
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:31,820
the word is under the topic i signs were two

888
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:36,750
if i take all the topics and i put all the words with equal probability

889
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,580
in those topics then

890
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:43,190
every word going have the same probability

891
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:47,030
but if i divide the words are equally let's say i divide let's say i

892
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:51,050
fail to see some words

893
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:57,370
some words going here is going to and so on until you hear

894
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,300
i got more mass on a smaller set of words so this likelihood term is

895
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,040
going to be bigger

896
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,120
the run see that

897
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:11,780
so forgetting about properties of priors and sparsity india's slaves and x y and c

898
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,740
it makes sense

899
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,890
the couple examples but not unrealistic example

900
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:22,280
OK so that's the thing that you proposed by time varying slice sampling i mean

901
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,180
the name of the council one long sold most of the techniques originates actually from

902
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:34,450
physics well basically MCMC will introduce the fifty years ago OK so the techniques also

903
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:39,010
which i discuss which are directly related to

904
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:44,260
the estimation of the normalizing constant of the targets of the timing of told you

905
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,100
well basically

906
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,910
what we're trying to do with target distribution pi x which is known up to

907
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:55,220
a normalizing constant to this gamma out of x divided by the normalizing constant is

908
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:00,490
the integral of gamma of the the the the space of interest on i focused

909
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,530
on methods which all why something

910
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,280
alright essentially

911
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:07,180
estimates of

912
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,890
samples of ultimate sample from pi

913
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:17,390
if you want to evaluate the normalizing constant versus normalizing constant this is completely different

914
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:23,990
business actually on celebrate bridge sampling path sampling yes i will discuss the matter to

915
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:29,240
more related to particle method which which is used to compute normalizing constant estimates but

916
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,240
it's actually quite different

917
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,060
OK so to your current

918
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:39,820
overview of what people for example are doing trying to come up with the advent

919
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:40,910
of the calorimeter

920
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:45,910
so this can be very briefly for example the idea behind what we sample a

921
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,280
slice sampling

922
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,850
the meeting of the county

923
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:52,260
on pilot comp

924
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,120
what slice sampling does OK for example

925
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,510
well is going to basically

926
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:05,030
say OK so interest target distribution pi x which is known up to a normalizing

927
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:08,430
constant because is gamma x opposite

928
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:10,990
what you can do

929
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,850
you're gonna basically

930
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:15,700
modify the target distributions

931
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,530
on introducing notes i you OK so you introduce a new distribution prior to that

932
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:27,680
which now basically known independent of x but also depend one of w

933
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,640
OK on the way in which is already in value on the viability of these

934
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,160
joint distribution

935
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:36,050
you make it such that by construction

936
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,160
is proportional to

937
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:41,030
the uniform distribution of u

938
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:45,470
basically only entails the organics so you can do that

939
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:49,370
sure so you get is this solution so it seems to be coming out of

940
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:51,390
nowhere this idea

941
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,760
so get a distribution

942
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,560
o i'm basically what people have done that

943
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:02,740
is that they said distribution actually can be easier to sample from the distribution pi

944
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:08,600
t and instead of OK so parts we discussed that later but for the timely

945
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:14,560
let's consider the interest distribution what is the remarkable property of the distribution

946
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,490
if you look

947
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:20,180
and the marginal

948
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,720
and apply to the of x

949
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:26,450
well what it is well basically what you do to look at the marginals

950
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,760
and x the fighting the makes you integrate this guy over u

951
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,510
the joint distribution of u

952
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,890
OK that's going to be proportional

953
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,180
together x

954
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:41,560
well because the point distribution clearly it means that by two that of x's pyrex

955
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:47,990
because that you could the new you build the x like an artificial extended target

956
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:54,680
which admits as marginal distribution and index what you're what you're interested that's the trick

957
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:59,850
in multicellular might actually we see it again and again actually to more

958
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:03,200
i know what you think can be nice

959
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,240
OK to sample from

960
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:09,810
why is it that y cannot be seen to sample from these guys then directly

961
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:13,080
from pyrex well simply because now

962
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,060
based on this join

963
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:21,430
distribution by two then you can use all the not essentially multicolour CP to sample

964
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:23,370
from it so in particular

965
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:27,260
what you could try to use you could try to give sampled

966
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,740
from basically

967
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:34,660
these artificial target distribution that is sampling for you given x and apply to the

968
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:38,970
all then sampling x u one u two u on the by two

969
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,530
on that's going to be the sample

970
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:44,600
right so some component was sort of not

971
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:47,990
expressible as a linear combination of the training data

972
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,330
then actually that

973
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:54,530
component has no effect on the training right because it's orthogonal will be taken into

974
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:58,330
product with any of the training examples it has no effect

975
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,080
so remember

976
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,620
but we were one of the things we trying to control was the norm of

977
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:08,560
the weight vector well let's just throw away that components orthogonal

978
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,990
we've got smaller

979
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:13,470
the norm of the weight vector doing the same thing

980
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:18,350
so clearly you know it's not going to be sensible to include that orthogonal components

981
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:22,720
in solving any optimisation of the type that we described earlier

982
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,060
and so it's almost certainly the the case in

983
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,330
all sensible

984
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:31,430
definitions of learning problems that you can and

985
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:36,430
with a weight vector that does have a dual representation

986
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:37,200
and that

987
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:41,890
is known as the representer theorem i mean i've just given you a sort of

988
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:46,160
intuitive argument about proof of the representer theorem

989
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,850
so i think you know what i would say you know i don't want to

990
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:53,970
go into more detail that we can quite reasonably expect the weight vector can be

991
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,680
expressed in this form

992
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,580
in other words

993
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,620
this is not just something

994
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,100
we we could possibly hope for something we can expect

995
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,390
to be the case

996
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:10,080
so what that means is that we can now reformulate algorithms to learn

997
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:16,140
the weight vector as algorithms that learn the dual variables rather than learned

998
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:20,010
actual weight vector itself in other words what i'm saying is

999
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,160
why don't we

1000
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:26,120
rather than trying to understand what you try trying to learn these alpha arise

1001
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:30,370
so again it's not clear why that's a good thing to do

1002
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:35,350
but will see it very quickly why that is is is useful

1003
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:38,910
but for the time being all we've done is observed the

1004
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:42,330
yes the weight vector is very likely to be expressible in this form if we've

1005
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:44,370
written a sensible learning problem

1006
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:46,140
and that means that we

1007
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,330
could actually

1008
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:50,280
by learning these alpha is rather learning these studies

1009
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:53,780
so i

1010
00:59:53,810 --> 01:00:02,810
what i'm saying is that if you define your problem with the sensible control only

1011
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:04,850
on the norm of the weight vectors

1012
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:06,260
then it will be true

1013
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:11,640
effectively it's going to force those compounds are not in that span to go to

1014
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,760
because in

1015
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:21,030
let's do this for the SVM

1016
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:27,800
now in fact with the SVM if you just go to the dual optimisation problem

1017
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:30,700
so what i wrote down was actually

1018
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,640
can be viewed as before

1019
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,800
let's go back to that slide defining

1020
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:40,200
what have we got well we're minimizing some quantity here

1021
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,100
subject to some constraint

1022
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,490
notice that the constraints are linear

1023
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:47,370
in the

1024
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,450
and james w b

1025
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:50,990
and excite

1026
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:59,220
but the optimisation we're making is quadratic OK sneering sinai but is quadratic in

1027
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,890
so it would involve

1028
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:04,890
no squares of components and so on

1029
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:09,870
so this is what is known as a quadratic programming problem so something that you

1030
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,970
know if you're an optimisation

1031
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:14,680
guru you know all about ten minutes

1032
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,950
by the stuff and

1033
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:22,810
it actually is a nice quadratic programming problem because it actually is convex this function

1034
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:27,370
here of the weight vector is convex which is you know why has this unique

1035
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:29,850
solution optimal solutions

1036
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:32,390
so this is just observing that

1037
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:38,350
by writing down the optimisation arrived at four support vector learning we actually come into

1038
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:40,240
a very standard framework

1039
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,740
that is

1040
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,810
he studied by many many people

1041
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:46,060
in in mathematical programming

1042
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:52,540
and it's it's has names for program and the properties are the these constraints are

1043
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:53,950
linear and the

1044
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:56,890
the objective is is quadratic now in

1045
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,680
in optimization theory

1046
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:07,720
there's a very well-developed understanding of the relationship between a problem and

1047
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,330
a so-called dual problem

1048
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:12,260
so the linear programming had the dual linear program

1049
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,580
in quadratic programming had the dual

1050
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:17,040
again and

1051
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:20,450
this in a way of deriving this which i don't want to go into not

1052
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:22,680
is not quite the chemical

1053
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,950
but if you follow that

1054
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:26,910
you actually arrive at

1055
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:32,910
the dual representation that i i described in the previous slide

1056
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:37,490
the way that it actually turns out to be in this form actually with a

1057
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:42,330
very slight difference that is the why and here the label the alpha rise will

1058
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:44,300
be positive all of them

1059
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:47,810
and i'll will be why i because it back to the negative examples you really

1060
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:50,560
want negative contributions from

1061
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,600
that particular example

1062
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:56,850
OK so so there's an additional thing here but you know

1063
01:02:56,890 --> 01:03:00,850
to all intents and purposes it is a linear combination of the training examples is

1064
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:01,930
just the

1065
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:06,310
components negative for negative examples positive positive examples

1066
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:07,580
and we choose to

1067
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,410
right in terms of these alpha rise now

1068
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:14,310
which are constrained to be positive notice of course

1069
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:21,140
so if you do that translation using that general approach

1070
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:23,640
espoused by optimisation

1071
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,740
good news

1072
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,850
when you arrive at this problem

1073
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,390
so typically the dual

1074
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:32,240
it's always maximizing when primal is minimizing

1075
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:33,410
so the

1076
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:39,240
and here again we have a quadratic function were optimizing subject to linear constraints

1077
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,390
the form of the function is

1078
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:47,640
some of the authorized minus two point five and this quadratic forms

1079
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:52,910
alpha i alpha j one one j five x inner product five xj

1080
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:56,010
constraint is a weighted

1081
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,830
constraints on the

1082
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:00,640
alpha rise should be equal to zero

1083
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:05,760
and the band between zero and c for the alpha i

1084
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:11,010
so just firstly to talk through a little bit of where these components come from

1085
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:18,080
notice the sea comes from that trade parameter that i described that traded off the

1086
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,620
accuracy on the training data is against the norm of the

1087
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,660
the weight vector that's what i see comes from and by varying that c

1088
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:32,780
you allow ourselves to get smaller or the constraint and the constraint is often referred

1089
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:37,850
to as the box constraints because if you think about it in multidimensional space

1090
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:40,260
it's actually a nice little box

1091
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:44,740
with the origin one corner cccccc the other one

1092
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:49,800
so this is the constraint arises this one

1093
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:55,160
a constraint that arises from having the

1094
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,810
offset b

1095
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,140

one announcement even though you will have no academic exercises

1101
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,350
thursday and friday i know you feel

1102
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,090
the sense of

1103
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:35,810
shock and disruption and

1104
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:39,510
there is a dislocation in your life if i didn't

1105
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:43,380
stick to schedule so there will be a skill testing question on

1106
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,150
tuesday based on homework twelve

1107
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:48,870
and that would be the last one because there

1108
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:53,300
subsequent week is the last week of semester and since it's the final exam

1109
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:56,300
in this subject there can be no

1110
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:59,230
test during the last week of class

1111
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,040
we will

1112
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,130
don't have any weekly tests

1113
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,620
today i want to talk about biochemistry spend

1114
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:09,250
the next three lectures on biochemistry this is the chemistry

1115
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:11,110
of living organisms

1116
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:14,860
and i want to make several points by way of introduction

1117
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,450
the first one is that are

1118
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,640
living organisms are

1119
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:21,050
chemical systems

1120
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,550
and are governed by the same laws

1121
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:26,910
that apply to inanimate matter we don't have special chemistry

1122
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:29,140
and in fact i came across

1123
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:35,640
comment that was made by the nobel laureate richard feynman

1124
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,000
he said that if in some cataclysm

1125
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:43,120
all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed and only one sentence

1126
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,950
passed on to the next generations of creatures

1127
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:50,390
what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words

1128
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,610
i believe

1129
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:54,080
that it is the atomic hypothesis

1130
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:59,110
for the atomic fact whatever you wish to call it that all things are made

1131
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:01,610
of atoms

1132
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:04,870
little particles that move around perpetual motion

1133
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:07,720
attracting each other when they were little distance apart

1134
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,120
propelling upon being squeezed into one another

1135
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:13,080
the atomic hypothesis

1136
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:14,920
very important

1137
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:19,210
second comment i want to make is that

1138
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:24,700
none of us is unaware of the boom and biotechnology today

1139
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:29,930
what is the boom and biotechnology why do we have the boom and biotechnology it's

1140
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:36,930
really a boom in biochemical technology which the modern biology called it's called molecular biology

1141
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:42,020
and what is the science what is molecular science this is chemistry and more importantly

1142
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:42,770
it is

1143
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:46,200
not just chemical composition but

1144
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:48,550
spatial arrangement

1145
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:55,580
chemistry materials science and solid state chemistry underlie the boom in

1146
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:00,460
so that's why we're going to spend some time responding ten percent of our lectures

1147
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,890
and through nine one on this topic

1148
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,920
the last comment is wildly now

1149
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:07,450
why did this happen

1150
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,230
fifty years ago

1151
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:12,140
what's enabling this boom today

1152
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:13,770
and i think about

1153
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:23,980
well the answer is complex let's get the answer the answer is complexity of the

1154
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,830
and if you think about how

1155
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:29,450
materials have evolved over time

1156
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,630
you know we day are ages

1157
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,480
the ages of man or data in terms of materials we have the stone age

1158
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,420
bronze age iron age

1159
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:41,900
you might call the first half of the twentieth century the

1160
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,520
plastics age

1161
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:47,800
like all the last half of the twentieth century the silicon age

1162
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:53,330
and we see increasing complexity to work with stone stone is found in nature and

1163
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,950
requires only a change of shape

1164
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:57,520
but everything else

1165
01:08:57,610 --> 01:09:02,170
the medals the bronze the iris not found in nature nature

1166
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:07,650
so that requires the change in shape after a change in the chemical composition

1167
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:09,730
chemistry is magic

1168
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:12,290
chemistry is magic

1169
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:14,300
and cameras were revered

1170
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:15,830
as sorcerers

1171
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:19,410
highly respected

1172
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,330
not today

1173
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:26,680
there are compelling reasons to be alive today but not for the respect given to

1174
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:33,490
but it's magic to take something to convert its chemical composition that took

1175
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:37,810
to get the fires hot enough to discover the chemistry that will allow us to

1176
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:42,970
the pile of sand and turn it into a semiconducting devices that you could

1177
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,450
talk on the phone or

1178
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:46,770
type the letter on

1179
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:49,580
solid state device known as the computer

1180
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,760
so polymers come at the dawn of the twentieth

1181
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:55,160
twentieth century

1182
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:58,840
macromolecules it turns out that many of the

1183
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:01,100
molecules in

1184
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:07,290
living organisms are macromolecules necessarily our understanding of this chemistry had two

1185
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:10,500
wait for the understanding of polymer chemistry

1186
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,440
finally now we have information technology

1187
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:14,640
we have

1188
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:18,820
our understanding of macromolecules and now we can go forward with

1189
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:20,990
bio technology so

1190
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,700
let's get down to

1191
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:26,890
business and start talking about the chemistry of specific

1192
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,680
biomolecules and

1193
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:35,630
they fall broadly into four categories so let's document before

1194
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,370
by all

1195
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:46,400
so we first of all proteins

1196
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:56,680
nucleic acids

1197
01:10:56,690 --> 01:11:05,330
and lived in the three lectures that we're going to focus primarily on proteins

1198
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:07,830
nucleic acids and lipids

1199
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:11,340
and i think this will get you far enough along

1200
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,630
enjoy subsequent

1201
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:16,750
but as you might

1202
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:22,100
no i'm a fan of course into so i'm from institute for computer graphics and

1203
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:25,030
at scratching technology

1204
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,670
so we may need to do

1205
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,020
computer vision

1206
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:32,450
actually we have two groups that in our institute which is a division part is

1207
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,060
related to machine learning

1208
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:40,150
and one of the things we use mainly in our daily practices posting an ensemble

1209
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:45,470
have been or looks as in the inputs can so i'm going to

1210
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:49,710
you know the briefly to assemble methods in machine learning

1211
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:55,780
and i think since you have got your formula those today by previous lecture so

1212
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:58,940
i'm going to be as this formula now

1213
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,390
presenting as this from the camp

1214
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,970
let's just get started so

1215
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,570
outline of the talk so i'm just going to use it

1216
01:12:07,610 --> 01:12:10,080
ensemble methods then

1217
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:13,750
the main concept behind on some because missus model averaging

1218
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:18,040
then i'll talk to one of the present our first methods

1219
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:23,630
an ensemble methods which is called bagging to move forward turn another perspective which is

1220
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,960
called stagewise additive modeling

1221
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:30,740
which we see we'll see that boosting is a special case of this approach and

1222
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:36,180
that i give you a practical example with some videos related to computer vision

1223
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,880
OK so let's think that you know

1224
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,240
you have the you know in your PC

1225
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:46,410
it's coming without any operating system and then

1226
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:50,750
you have also not in any knowledge of you know which operating system you are

1227
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:53,270
going to choose so that we humans do

1228
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:57,290
is actually go and ask people who knows about the existence

1229
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:01,070
two not for example if you are going to use windows are going to

1230
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:04,160
use for example in books and give you some you know

1231
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:08,740
devices and then you come up from make your mind based on you know your

1232
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:13,610
decision criterion then you know whatever operating system that you do

1233
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:15,600
that you favor

1234
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:16,850
so one of the

1235
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:19,350
simplest ways of our

1236
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:22,910
deciding you know what operating system you have to choose

1237
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:28,340
based on the opinions of the experts is to just use the

1238
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:29,820
major world teams

1239
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:31,630
which means that

1240
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:34,160
there's just

1241
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:38,790
if you come light eleven people and six of them said that she was some

1242
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,450
five said that using those just links

1243
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:44,260
let's major voting you do it in

1244
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,390
elections in

1245
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,370
presidency or other things

1246
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:49,890
so it is one of the simplest ways to

1247
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:52,100
combine the opinions of the person

1248
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:58,100
so now how we can write this in little formal way is that assume that

1249
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:01,350
you have set of experts so these functions here

1250
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:06,340
and each of these experts are going to tell you

1251
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:08,130
based on for example here but it

1252
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:09,920
she in those early

1253
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,350
for example

1254
01:14:11,370 --> 01:14:14,010
and if you sign

1255
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:15,820
labels to

1256
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,820
for example choosing linear says

1257
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:22,070
positive class and using those as negative class and the majority of voting can be

1258
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:23,910
treated like this

1259
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:26,100
so to sum up the opinions

1260
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:30,230
they are binary values and the next is bigger than zero said that i was

1261
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,510
in the sixties

1262
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:33,040
less than zero you choose

1263
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,070
we know

1264
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:37,440
so this is the main concept behind also matters so

1265
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:38,620
most of the times

1266
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:42,220
but you will see some of that have to combine these

1267
01:14:42,230 --> 01:14:44,370
and have to find these

1268
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:51,790
and the interesting thing is that diversity is also important ensemble methods you don't want

1269
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,670
all models tell the same story two

1270
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:58,470
so i assume that these guys over here at TED by microsoft to you know

1271
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:03,170
promote windows and when are asking cases in those right so if they are going

1272
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:06,040
to be around all going to be around the same way

1273
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,510
better to have diversity

1274
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,660
let's have different points of view

1275
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:14,220
on the same problems that it can decided by the way

1276
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:17,480
so we also are looking for diversity in our

1277
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,880
our set of experts

1278
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,340
in some locations

1279
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,100
so this training set

1280
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,070
and to discuss about binary classification

1281
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:30,860
problem but all these methods can be applied to recreational multiclass problems

1282
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,050
so have a data set pairs of

1283
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:36,510
inputs some call the corresponding labels

1284
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,240
so sample comes from a d dimensional

1285
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:44,610
space samples are binary find some plus one this is a set of experts

1286
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:45,980
i mean by that

1287
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,840
so this the experts

1288
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:48,690
this the

1289
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,880
you know

1290
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,260
i assume so one says

1291
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:56,650
if you are is reflected in it validates all instances of t so that's the

1292
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:58,920
one on the right so what

1293
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:04,260
two right

1294
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,010
i suppose

1295
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:11,190
are these reflexes

1296
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:15,470
what is it mean it means that every world can see itself

1297
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:17,780
contradiction suppose

1298
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:22,450
for a contradiction

1299
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:30,170
it doesn't validate

1300
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,900
in the i mean stones

1301
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:37,150
say box signed life

1302
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:41,150
forced by this frame

1303
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:43,170
so the frame

1304
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:50,170
that's right does not force a particular instance box size but

1305
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:55,740
so what does that mean it means that we can put value h frame

1306
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:59,800
such that there's some world

1307
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:04,090
let's call it likely w w norton w no

1308
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:07,200
OK some which makes this guy falls

1309
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:11,470
so it makes foxi in i

1310
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,840
how do you make an implication falls

1311
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,150
the left part

1312
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:34,840
we supplies for all

1313
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:36,490
since OK

1314
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,490
evaluation right so

1315
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:49,550
what i'm going to do now

1316
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,930
he satisfy society with w node v

1317
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:02,820
why is that well if box size true then whenever you have a successor

1318
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:08,720
o thing to be true

1319
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:12,920
we know

1320
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:14,670
that is actually an arrow

1321
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:17,050
from w no now

1322
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,550
one of the world's that you can reach from w no

1323
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:24,070
and we have to be able to put aside

1324
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:26,170
because box size true

1325
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,130
so here and claim that's it's true

1326
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:35,920
we get a contradiction

1327
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:42,820
nineteen eighties this is

1328
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:45,450
what does it mean that this frame

1329
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:50,740
doesn't force box on the fly so there's some valuation which makes this guy true

1330
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:54,010
at some world we don't even know what means

1331
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:57,380
but we know that makes it true

1332
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,420
well that makes it true that

1333
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:04,200
whenever it makes bauxite i true it makes it true

1334
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,170
the book strauss bauxite resources

1335
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:13,590
so it makes it follows that makes bauxite room makes it falls for bauxite arbitrary

1336
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:18,340
here every once they pass success has to make excitatory but it's it's only one

1337
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:22,380
step six it so i can't true falls

1338
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:28,320
is OK let's take the other way

1339
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,780
right to left

1340
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:36,570
so what do we assume we assume that

1341
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:41,280
the invalidates all instances of so i suppose

1342
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:45,030
the frame

1343
01:19:48,190 --> 01:19:50,970
all instances of t

1344
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:55,320
and again for contradictions risk risk reflexive so for

1345
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:03,590
not reflects

1346
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:11,930
what is not reflexive me is at least one world somewhere there's one world which

1347
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:14,150
doesn't see itself

1348
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:19,340
doesn't mean that every world doesn't itself it just means is at least one god

1349
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,700
knows this can have all sorts of successes but we know that you can't do

1350
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:29,220
that's the forbidden age that's not in the market

1351
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,860
now what we do

1352
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:36,920
just to condition

1353
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,070
on the frame

1354
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:42,050
we are free to choose the value by any way you like

1355
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:46,220
it says that the frame is not reflexive so there the world

1356
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:48,400
so what am i gonna do

1357
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,740
i'm going to define the valuation

1358
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:56,130
foresight paid so he has been not groups

1359
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:58,320
and the action is

1360
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:00,780
i need to give evaluation

1361
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:06,090
so here's my p one p two dollars minute take on or

1362
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:13,530
evaluation is going to be that

1363
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:18,470
every world that you can see from here

1364
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:22,420
is going to make pain or true

1365
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:24,430
right so this evaluation

1366
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:28,110
each one of these evaluation

1367
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:35,070
do is i'm going to say

1368
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:39,650
if this guy can see you have to make this guy

1369
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:50,760
what's the truth value of box peano at this world

1370
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:52,800
i just defined

1371
01:21:54,130 --> 01:21:57,800
a real action so that wherever you can go in one step from this guy

1372
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,090
pinotage true so i've got to know orchestra

1373
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,820
that's fine

1374
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:07,510
what's the truth value of p in

1375
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:11,860
we know that this guy's not one step to prove itself

1376
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:15,760
so what i'll do is output p not false here

1377
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:19,360
and then i asked the question

1378
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:23,510
what about this formula

1379
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:26,050
is this true here

1380
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,800
because this part is true

1381
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:33,430
this pattern is false therefore falls

1382
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:34,950
is this

1383
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,300
an instance

1384
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:40,650
of of implies five

1385
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,220
yes it is

1386
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,530
WR's to validate all instances of t

1387
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:57,390
is an instance she doesn't validate

1388
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:03,340
if you suppose that invalidates all instances of t

1389
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:06,470
it's not possible

1390
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:10,650
to be not reflexive

1391
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:14,280
because if it's not reflexive you can put this perturbation

1392
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:22,840
truth tables

1393
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,370
he was

1394
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:49,020
just list all the possible values and thing

1395
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:54,380
i remember this is material in case which means that is

1396
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,530
the antecedent is false and true

1397
01:23:57,530 --> 01:24:02,100
in this case a useful quite true

1398
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,320
same thing

1399
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:08,570
if is true we have to cheque of that is true but this is not

1400
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:11,100
the case falls

1401
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:16,310
for this column which is the value

1402
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:29,960
and again you calculate the implications of this one one

1403
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:36,030
and dissidents falls is also true

1404
01:24:36,050 --> 01:24:38,300
two of the falls

1405
01:24:40,590 --> 01:24:42,760
now you see that this is true

1406
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:45,560
problems are exactly the same

1407
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:48,920
two formulas in fact

1408
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:52,510
but it people

1409
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:55,680
and then there are the

1410
01:24:55,700 --> 01:25:00,540
ontology is like that is associated with

1411
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:01,680
conjunction in

1412
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,870
this means that

1413
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:10,330
the way you put the parents around the conjunction and disjunction

1414
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:13,300
that's why sometimes we write

1415
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:16,320
a b

1416
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,880
see for example

1417
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:20,090
without the border between parents

1418
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:22,530
that's right

1419
01:25:22,570 --> 01:25:24,550
and this is around city

1420
01:25:24,570 --> 01:25:26,910
this section

1421
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:31,070
surgical treatment to put the prances around

1422
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:38,770
this means that if you have a conjunction to form in just this

1423
01:25:41,290 --> 01:25:44,310
and then there is morgan's

1424
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:49,780
which again highlights the duality logic

1425
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:51,960
so there is duality between

1426
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,230
conjunction disjunction

1427
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,100
you can negate the conjunction

1428
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:00,260
then you get the disjunction of the negation

1429
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:03,230
and vice versa

1430
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,380
negation cancel each other

1431
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:10,310
have a double negation a

1432
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:15,650
and all these laws

1433
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,360
will be used to transform

1434
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:22,540
propositional formula

1435
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:25,290
to work with

1436
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:27,790
see next slide

1437
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:35,740
so as i said in the beginning of this concept of syntax semantics and

1438
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:37,680
sounds question

1439
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,800
what we have seen with this tautology that

1440
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,330
all these operations changing

1441
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:47,610
the ship form that's not preserved

1442
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:51,890
this will be used in converting formula at the

1443
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:54,290
certain form which is more manageable

1444
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,640
normal forms

1445
01:26:58,650 --> 01:27:00,770
commonly used

1446
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:02,740
automated reasoning

1447
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:06,150
and the first one is called the negation normal form

1448
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:11,170
and then you can jump disjunctive normal form conjunctive

1449
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,360
for satisfiability checking

1450
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:16,230
the standard

1451
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:18,710
input is

1452
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,590
you know what

1453
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:25,250
so to simplify discussions

1454
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,050
assume that we

1455
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:31,780
the implications

1456
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,520
right so

1457
01:27:36,570 --> 01:27:42,640
this is one of the topology says that i think is actually equivalent to disjunction

1458
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:45,460
with with the antecedent is located

1459
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:52,150
so what we can do is replace the implication form with

1460
01:27:52,230 --> 01:27:54,800
disjunction negation

1461
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:58,560
and therefore we can work with former implication free

1462
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:07,900
and also we assume we don't have nullary operators

1463
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,800
also true

1464
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:15,070
now what is in negation normal form

1465
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:20,190
this is the form in which all the negation supposed to air on the left

1466
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23,630
so the only indication that ever appeared in form

1467
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:28,510
right so far

1468
01:28:28,630 --> 01:28:31,980
so for example

1469
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:36,420
a mean is not

1470
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,840
the negation of obviously because

1471
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:40,650
the negation appears

1472
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,870
on the other hand

1473
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:49,760
not x or y is

1474
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:55,090
the negation normal form because it

1475
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:57,630
the transform

1476
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:59,520
formula into the negation

1477
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:02,390
you supply

1478
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,300
these three tautology

1479
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:08,770
this is the moment of his or her

1480
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:13,130
so the negation above conjunction can push

1481
01:29:13,190 --> 01:29:17,310
the conjunction but change the conjunction to

1482
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:23,050
and vice versa the negation on top of this challenge was it down and it

1483
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:26,040
can change that

1484
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,740
when he hits another

1485
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:31,190
so then you can help

1486
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:34,770
so you can see that the recursive procedure

1487
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:37,850
there you have the disjunction is

1488
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:45,760
this is a pseudocode

1489
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,620
written functions language

1490
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:50,560
so you are familiar with

1491
01:29:55,080 --> 01:30:02,150
so you a is a literal literally means that it is fair

1492
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,660
or the negation of their

1493
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:07,030
then it is already in

1494
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,540
negation normal form

1495
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:12,050
so there is no need to normalize

1496
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,880
and we just returned a

1497
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:17,840
the interval of the second derivative of the function

1498
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:23,570
and then the question is if you have the data and the data allow i

1499
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:24,610
by the interval

1500
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:27,020
between zero one if you bit like this

1501
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:29,250
it turns out that you can actually do freeform

1502
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:33,380
optimisation confined to find the best function

1503
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:35,250
that optimizes thing here

1504
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:39,550
respecting the function to be a certain

1505
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:44,210
it turns out that the best possible function is piecewise cubic polynomials

1506
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:46,590
might be a little bit surprising if you haven't seen before

1507
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:49,760
of any kind of function you can think of

1508
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,500
or i guess it has to be

1509
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,130
it has to be differentiable

1510
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:59,320
well actually the problem is that what this means

1511
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:05,020
and the best possible and the idea here is that you want the function you

1512
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:09,000
don't want the function to curve too much because then it's that is unwilling to

1513
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:11,920
that might be nice to have

1514
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:18,630
if so you want something that doesn't wiggle too much analyse the secondary to that

1515
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:22,550
so how can we construct the gulf process that

1516
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:26,250
the same solution as the variational problem

1517
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:31,400
and in the construction look like this so

1518
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:35,940
again we do something which is very similar to the example before going to function

1519
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,130
was going to depend on a bunch of

1520
01:31:38,210 --> 01:31:44,030
promises promises going to have yeltsin distribution that's going to give us that the family

1521
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:45,860
and look like this is going to be

1522
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:48,130
one parameter alpha

1523
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:50,750
the time axis is going to be linear

1524
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,300
contribution here

1525
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,520
the more interesting part is the part of here

1526
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:56,130
i was going to be going some

1527
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:59,250
and we're going to have infinitely many contributions again

1528
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:04,020
the contributions are going to be some constant gamma i just like before

1529
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:05,050
it's going to be

1530
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:07,500
some of these little round function

1531
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:10,500
the bracket with the parts of the end

1532
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:13,800
i mean it has to the value x effect of the

1533
01:32:14,130 --> 01:32:18,520
and zero otherwise you have some of these little ramps

1534
01:32:18,630 --> 01:32:20,320
around the centre

1535
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,250
everywhere within the interval

1536
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:26,780
now we've got some together all these things

1537
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:27,980
and then we have to

1538
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:30,780
worry about normalizing this doesn't

1539
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:35,980
the doesn't sum up to be a big and bigger function or what we normalize

1540
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:41,400
the by one over the world

1541
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:44,880
OK and then we have to put up with priors

1542
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:46,210
on these parameters

1543
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:48,090
we put

1544
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:50,480
got priors on all these things

1545
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:53,400
we put copyright the particular variant

1546
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:55,670
these two guys and the different variants

1547
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:58,960
this is the gamma promise

1548
01:32:58,980 --> 01:33:00,000
this now

1549
01:33:00,030 --> 01:33:02,920
defines a distribution over functions

1550
01:33:03,170 --> 01:33:06,840
because this was does in the limit where he has to look

1551
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:08,440
so these

1552
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:12,360
some of these people but some of the

1553
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:15,940
negative some of the positive or something about the round

1554
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:19,550
you think about what happens when you add together

1555
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:22,980
o infinite many of these

1556
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:28,260
so what do we do to analyse what happened well we can compute the mean

1557
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:29,940
function and covariance function but

1558
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,920
we're trying to get process

1559
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:34,030
the same way as before

1560
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:36,550
the covariance function here

1561
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:38,020
it's going to be

1562
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:39,630
take the

1563
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:42,590
the limit as n goes to infinity again

1564
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:44,440
and then

1565
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:49,550
we get one or in some which and went into

1566
01:33:49,610 --> 01:33:52,300
an interval alpha from one

1567
01:33:52,690 --> 01:33:58,210
and then we compute this integral to the to the polynomial mean square

1568
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:00,650
polynomial in u

1569
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:02,340
piecewise the some

1570
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:07,360
but problem with we we do that then we get something which is a constant

1571
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,960
times something

1572
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
which is

1573
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:12,440
a cubic polynomial

1574
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:17,780
are a piecewise cubic polynomial in x

1575
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:19,590
now we know

1576
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:23,280
when gonna to make predictions using this covariance function

1577
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:28,070
then the predictions we'll have the form which is a linear combination of kernels

1578
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:30,020
o grants functions evaluated

1579
01:34:30,030 --> 01:34:30,730
at the

1580
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:32,670
training and test points

1581
01:34:32,690 --> 01:34:35,030
that function will be a piecewise

1582
01:34:35,050 --> 01:34:39,560
two people on because of a bunch of course the time these things to evaluate

1583
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:43,750
x star and all of the

1584
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:46,670
not going to be a piecewise

1585
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,190
that was going to happen before

1586
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:58,280
and then there a need to take you need to take the limit the variance

1587
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,630
of the parameter controlling the

1588
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:02,570
lena components

1589
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:06,340
you have to take the limit where this main article

1590
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:09,170
and that's a little bit unpleasant they have to be careful

1591
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:10,980
to do that correctly

1592
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,780
now why is that we understand why that is

1593
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:17,610
well trivial to say because there is no penalty

1594
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:19,130
on the function

1595
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:23,000
the penalty will always be zero rolling up

1596
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:27,610
that means that this actually correspond to the solution of the variational problem must somehow

1597
01:35:27,610 --> 01:35:30,170
include all kinds of you

1598
01:35:30,190 --> 01:35:31,520
it is therefore

1599
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:34,030
they want to see the data then of course

1600
01:35:34,070 --> 01:35:37,250
we have to bring it back down to actually take account of the data that's

1601
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:38,860
why you get this solid

1602
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:42,980
the problem by the predictive distribution itself is fine

1603
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,750
OK there's a bunch about here

1604
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:47,860
it's going show you an example

1605
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:54,340
here's an example of have a bunch of data points that ten data points

1606
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:58,170
and i i again i think the

1607
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,590
optimize the

1608
01:36:00,610 --> 01:36:03,860
the parameters of the

1609
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,400
crisp function which the

1610
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:08,980
which gamma in this case the noise level two problem

1611
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:16,980
the airport again the mean function in this that black line again plus minus the

1612
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:18,670
particular solution

1613
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:21,230
what you can see here what you can see that but this but i can

1614
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:25,570
tell you that this function here the piece wise uniform

1615
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:27,320
so you should be able to see

1616
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:30,170
thanks to the function does anything more than

1617
01:36:30,210 --> 01:36:34,360
a cubic polynomial do between two data points

1618
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:38,590
piecewise polynomial in the end pieces go between each the

1619
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:42,940
OK so

1620
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:44,090
at NUS

1621
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,270
any possible

1622
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:47,640
o point on the

1623
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,880
on the on the x axis right

1624
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,930
so i had sort of injected anything into the system of the the covariance function

1625
01:36:54,050 --> 01:37:00,530
i specify the green's function but everything follows from that

1626
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:03,840
so it's actually really is actually really interesting to try and do this on your

1627
01:37:05,210 --> 01:37:12,710
because it's it's a it's not very usual way to think about functions

1628
01:37:13,090 --> 01:37:15,300
so here's a picture of

1629
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:18,590
doing this in two-dimensional case so here have

1630
01:37:18,610 --> 01:37:21,980
and input which is which is of two dimensions

1631
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:22,950
and i have a

1632
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:25,840
so drawn my axes are

1633
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:28,500
the six hundred points along

1634
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,640
this axis hundred points

1635
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:31,990
along this axis

1636
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:37,110
so my input space contains ten thousand points

1637
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:39,990
that means that my

1638
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:43,000
i covariance function

1639
01:37:43,050 --> 01:37:46,570
so i have an entry in the covariance function for each pair of points

1640
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:48,960
i mean i covariance matrix

1641
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:51,480
the ten thousand by ten thousand matrix

1642
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:52,750
right i draw

1643
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:54,410
o point from that

1644
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:59,840
ten thousand dimensional gaussians is the ten thousand dimensional vector that can plot the values

1645
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:03,410
as a function of those corresponding

1646
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:04,810
and this is the function

1647
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:07,140
but i'd rather so a random function from

1648
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:20,700
so so

1649
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:23,890
so the question is you know if i'm if i'm making inference about functions that

1650
01:38:23,890 --> 01:38:24,950
i don't know

1651
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:26,640
and how can i know the

1652
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,130
covariance so

1653
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:29,370
up until now

1654
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:31,620
i've only been trying to characterize

1655
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:34,980
the notion of the gaussianprocess right so we haven't so this is all about random

1656
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:38,210
so how actually told you about

1657
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:40,240
you know how would you actually

1658
01:38:40,450 --> 01:38:44,240
usually you're not interested in random functions you're into the functions that

1659
01:38:44,290 --> 01:38:49,230
that are useful for predicting whatever it is you're interested right so we had gotten

1660
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:50,230
that far yet

1661
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:56,930
so but the but the but the distribution over functions specified there's a certain covariance

1662
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:00,920
in this and the covariance depends in a certain way upon the

1663
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:02,000
upon the inputs

1664
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:04,940
and this somehow implies something about

1665
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:08,700
the function functions phi and i'll tell you more about that is and how works

1666
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:19,120
OK so the gas process defines a distribution over functions right

1667
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:20,990
and this is one function

1668
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,740
drawn from the distribution function

1669
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:26,400
and i can only show you

1670
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:32,940
a finite number of function values for so only ten thousand ideas here

1671
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:36,030
when the limit the picture would look the same but because all the points that

1672
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:39,060
would be in between would have also been between because

1673
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,200
this particular gaussianprocess with this

1674
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:42,570
with this covariance function

1675
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:48,670
actually has the property that it that it's that generate smooth functions

1676
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,070
so if i drew this

1677
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:59,560
i even finer grained than you look things

1678
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:00,740
so the function

1679
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:04,940
is it is the function of x one and x two this is the function

1680
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:06,480
value f over here

1681
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:09,070
this is just illustrate that

1682
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:13,070
in my simple example had of a function which was from a one-dimensional x to

1683
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:15,390
f of x

1684
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:18,660
but i'm not and need not be the case but you can also have the

1685
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:20,760
axes can live in in

1686
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:23,860
any space

1687
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:41,830
that's right so the covariance structure

1688
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:43,500
the command structure

1689
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,120
tell you something about

1690
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,370
how the

1691
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:50,270
what the dependencies between cases right so if i say well conditioned on that i

1692
01:40:50,270 --> 01:40:51,370
had this point

1693
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:56,020
that tells me something about what's going on elsewhere right now so force exactly

1694
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,240
what we're trying to

1695
01:40:57,250 --> 01:41:01,400
to utilize we're trying to learn about function thing overtaking this observation

1696
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:03,110
i could tell me something about

1697
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:06,660
the function not just at that point but also at nearby points in some sense

1698
01:41:07,010 --> 01:41:10,460
right will have to get closer to exactly one is that sense and try to

1699
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:22,300
so the the the ordering of axes this is completely irrelevant

1700
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:37,860
OK this is that this is a random sample from bell-shaped curve

1701
01:41:37,950 --> 01:41:41,290
you have the bell-shaped curve in one dimension then if you draw a random sample

1702
01:41:41,290 --> 01:41:43,440
from that is the number

1703
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:45,720
OK now i have a high dimensional one

1704
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:48,610
so when i draw a sample from the distribution

1705
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:51,110
i can show you a picture of the high dimensional gaussians but if if you

1706
01:41:52,050 --> 01:41:54,260
sample from it it's back to right

1707
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:55,520
and i'm showing you

1708
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:58,780
picture that

1709
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:08,150
as somebody have already

1710
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:11,930
i mentioned you know this was only about random functions right so how do we

1711
01:42:11,930 --> 01:42:14,150
actually how do we use this

1712
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:18,070
to learn something about functions

1713
01:42:18,130 --> 01:42:19,130
so now i'm going to

1714
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:21,480
i'm going to tell you how to do that in the

1715
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:23,380
the three-step procedure

1716
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:24,960
first i'm going to talk about

1717
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:30,240
how to do maximum likelihood and what i call a parametric method parametric model

1718
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:31,280
i'm going to

1719
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,600
welcome this afternoon

1720
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:36,610
so the

1721
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:38,190
intention with this talk

1722
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:42,540
to have somebody who would really give you information

1723
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:44,210
from within three days

1724
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:47,560
we'll deal between but from the outside side so here we have

1725
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:49,250
somebody who

1726
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:51,530
sees from the inside outside

1727
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:54,870
probably the best person

1728
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:59,130
we can get so one of the best people of this kind would be like

1729
01:43:02,150 --> 01:43:03,270
a few words about dialects so

1730
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:06,360
but he was doing big data even before r

1731
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:08,710
anybody mention this

1732
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:09,660
the worked

1733
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:15,250
the whole series of big companies

1734
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:18,280
back in

1735
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:21,140
early two thousands he was seen well

1736
01:43:21,690 --> 01:43:26,120
so he sold his you well streams of data not doing that

1737
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:29,770
spam detection and detecting all this

1738
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:38,470
shady business which happens on the internet and from the outside so lots of experience and that's it

1739
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:40,200
then he moved to

1740
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:44,680
microsoft's to life flaps so he was in this core group which

1741
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:48,140
evolved so i guess into today's

1742
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:51,630
hands two years ago at

1743
01:43:52,730 --> 01:43:54,200
two years ago i like move to

1744
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:58,780
there was already around but not as popular as they

1745
01:44:01,290 --> 01:44:02,330
big announcements

1746
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:06,820
smart person from markets are going to be like

1747
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:14,530
now he works in this

1748
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:18,100
that's research e side of it

1749
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:19,630
you around much she

1750
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:26,030
touches the data every day which would only wish to touch most of us

1751
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:32,420
then set about the idea is basically to give us a little bit of a flavor what happens behind that

1752
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:35,780
that's question not really what

1753
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:37,630
i like this

1754
01:44:39,070 --> 01:44:39,610
thank you marko

1755
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:41,590
thank you all for coming

1756
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:44,230
so we begin by

1757
01:44:44,850 --> 01:44:49,130
referring to the previous keynote speaker and and the other see also sigma

1758
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:53,440
last weekend's interesting conceal certain concept

1759
01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:56,540
spread around pretty fast

1760
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:58,560
research network like

1761
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:02,490
for those killed each sigmod which referred to

1762
01:45:04,510 --> 01:45:06,650
people as database experts

1763
01:45:07,310 --> 01:45:11,700
the scientists and data enthusiasts and so on

1764
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:12,510
o thing that

1765
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,830
the previous speaker correctly

1766
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:20,170
classified this community is being go far very cool database experts which are

1767
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:26,510
on my talk is more about machine learning and i think the machine learning perspective

1768
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:30,200
this community from the community of of machine learning enthusiasts

1769
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:34,620
she learning is now the key problem but there's a be quite useful

1770
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,070
eleven applications

1771
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:42,160
well i'm going to talk about this is something which is really discussed is

1772
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:43,690
how they basically

1773
01:45:44,190 --> 01:45:49,350
build a fairly large machine learning system over what we call big data right now

1774
01:45:50,170 --> 01:45:53,390
and i'm going to talk about later whether or not we can call for a big data

1775
01:45:54,170 --> 01:45:55,090
but things got some

1776
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:58,600
well they kind of processes and thought processes that we went through

1777
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:02,740
in trying to make it scalable and try to make it useful forward

1778
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:08,220
data experts or scientists who like and that zero

1779
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:10,940
so let me ask

1780
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:13,240
everybody how many people actually use

1781
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:15,100
is a hand

1782
01:46:15,790 --> 01:46:16,240
so what

1783
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:21,120
so i quite sure how much deft explain what you need is still some

1784
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:23,310
some are called pictures

1785
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:28,550
so this is an event which happened a few years ago and essentially so as they

1786
01:46:29,530 --> 01:46:30,610
mid-size earthquake

1787
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:35,130
which think the whole the damage but managed to shook

1788
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:37,740
six supermarket shelves you can see

1789
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:40,600
so there's an interesting statistics

1790
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:42,410
the second

1791
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:47,850
what is holding radiation there are two different ways of thinking about it and i

1792
01:46:47,850 --> 01:46:52,160
will give you both arguments just to get some information about them

1793
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:58,930
well here is first a simple handwaving arguments you're probably or more familiar with another

1794
01:46:58,930 --> 01:47:06,470
phenomenon called just creation and the creation of an electron positron prior spontaneously in an

1795
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:08,350
electric field

1796
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:15,250
and the way to compute these if you're just interested in order of magnitude calculations

1797
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:19,820
is very quick and goes as follows the result of string data that comes from

1798
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:24,930
the field theory calculation is that the rate of producing the plus and minus the

1799
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:28,800
bear some electric field unit volume

1800
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:34,000
goes like the exponential of minus the the mosque where the electron

1801
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:38,510
divided by charge times electric field times age by

1802
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:43,430
and there are some numerical factors both index form here

1803
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,820
now the reason why this is

1804
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:52,920
the correct expression goes as follows well we are computing really quantum tunnelling probability so

1805
01:47:52,930 --> 01:47:58,170
here is how you would computed here is apparent from the plus and minus it

1806
01:47:58,170 --> 01:48:04,410
is at first eventually abandoned that creates created out of fluctuations in the vacuum

1807
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:09,800
but then there is an electric field that accelerates the particles and does well in

1808
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:11,560
the two particles

1809
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:17,060
so let's compute the work done by this external force field of the particles as

1810
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:23,730
they move up the work is force times separation so it grows linearly

1811
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:29,030
and then there is some critical separation which you see is the force over twice

1812
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:34,910
the miners and that this could become separation we have actually done enough work

1813
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:37,020
with the external field

1814
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:43,800
two materialize the parent terms from virtual to real of particles with energy equal to

1815
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:49,820
therefore you can definitely think of this process as it and link probability you want

1816
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:53,050
to ban them from zero to q twenty

1817
01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:56,080
and the underlying operating quantum mechanics is

1818
01:48:56,130 --> 01:48:59,820
given by a very simple reformulates roughly speaking

1819
01:48:59,890 --> 01:49:00,920
the area

1820
01:49:00,930 --> 01:49:03,420
of these potential barrier

1821
01:49:03,430 --> 01:49:07,610
and if you compute the area of this potential buyer you get exactly the shrink

1822
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:13,010
namely e to the minus m squared which we h barrett

1823
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:17,420
h bodies there because that's the quantum

1824
01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:21,420
now think of doing a similar calculation but not

1825
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:24,580
in terms of

1826
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:28,000
production in an electric field now but

1827
01:49:28,050 --> 01:49:32,430
producing the bear in the horizon of a black hole

1828
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:35,570
so the idea here is that i'm going to do the same thing and now

1829
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:40,000
producing virtual there somewhere in the horizon of a black hole

1830
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:43,910
one of the particle moves out the other moves in

1831
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,650
they are accelerating

1832
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:48,390
the force field of a black hole

1833
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:52,510
no one will fall behind the horizon and we never see any more but the

1834
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:53,630
other one may

1835
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:58,380
it becomes very ill and come out at infinity and will be seen as hawking

1836
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:01,130
radiation are infinite

1837
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:07,810
what will be the difference from the previous calculation well roughly speaking the force field

1838
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:15,180
which was charged times electric field before is be simply replaced by neutrons for namely

1839
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:17,910
g note on the mass of the black hole

1840
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,670
the mass of the probe particles really the article created over m squared and four

1841
01:50:23,670 --> 01:50:28,170
hours here i have put in the horizon news which is that it becomes

1842
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:31,530
a region one of these will be happening

1843
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:35,810
now remembered for his what's black hole are forced to

1844
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:37,610
gn m

1845
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:39,630
and therefore this

1846
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:45,090
force field is of the order of little lamb over g

1847
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:49,250
now there are two important things to note here first of all the force

1848
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,220
is proportional to the mass

1849
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:56,800
that's because we are talking about the gravitational force not an electromagnetic force

1850
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,350
therefore one of the two

1851
01:51:00,930 --> 01:51:02,760
in swing disarray

1852
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:06,570
he will be killed by the force field and there are a few will be

1853
01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:10,080
exponential miners must not months square

1854
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:16,190
this sense it's a show of independence from us and it makes it look fair

1855
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:22,510
right that's not like it what's factor e to the minus the temperature and mass

1856
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,360
or energy

1857
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:29,720
now what is the temperature what the temperature of the inverse temperature is precisely

1858
01:51:29,730 --> 01:51:31,060
your done

1859
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:32,690
the big

1860
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:36,140
much of the black hole over h bar

1861
01:51:36,150 --> 01:51:42,810
call this hawking temperature and i'll write it down in the next inspire more appropriately

1862
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:46,940
so this is the naive arguments now let me give you the more precise argument

1863
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:51,900
which is also very simple to explain but requires a little bit of quantum field

1864
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:56,520
and the more precise argument is the following

1865
01:51:56,950 --> 01:51:59,960
if you look back at the expression

1866
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:04,910
of the black hole that we have here this was the right most hole

1867
01:52:04,910 --> 01:52:10,660
a field theorists the one thing very irregularly they update time

1868
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:12,180
each component

1869
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:15,780
will be the response of one source acting alone

1870
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:17,340
so if i could figure out

1871
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:20,380
the effect of one source acting alone

1872
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:22,860
OK and put that down here

1873
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,840
and do the same thing for all the sources

1874
01:52:24,930 --> 01:52:26,550
that's what i get

1875
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:30,970
so far the sources we have

1876
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:34,260
the linear circuit so i know that the answer is going to be

1877
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:37,300
in the in the final answer is going to be in power

1878
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:41,340
this could be multiplied by some of land

1879
01:52:41,390 --> 01:52:43,410
OK i know that it's a linear circuit

1880
01:52:43,410 --> 01:52:47,490
so i know the answer show how would later in the year multiplied by some

1881
01:52:47,490 --> 01:52:51,110
constant moon simple i know

1882
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:52,910
OK so i the same is true

1883
01:52:52,930 --> 01:52:55,130
four all this is the

1884
01:52:57,660 --> 01:53:00,990
and what i can do they can measure just distance affected by setting all the

1885
01:53:00,990 --> 01:53:04,180
other sources to this concept

1886
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:07,050
all the other

1887
01:53:07,090 --> 01:53:08,490
and this is the no

1888
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:15,260
all the sources except for this one

1889
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:18,530
i can get that the answer

1890
01:53:18,550 --> 01:53:26,450
so similarly for everyone that source and we get or

1891
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:30,240
OK so for every single that source n one n two n three and so

1892
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:32,780
on and when get better

1893
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:34,450
there were some up

1894
01:53:35,570 --> 01:53:37,300
and we get to

1895
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:39,300
for i am

1896
01:53:40,510 --> 01:53:43,180
and i know that i inference

1897
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:44,700
and no

1898
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:47,200
it's going to be some constant b

1899
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:49,530
multiplying i and

1900
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:52,570
in this example of ours here

1901
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,820
in this example

1902
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:58,180
well this

1903
01:53:58,880 --> 01:53:59,930
and data

1904
01:53:59,970 --> 01:54:00,930
was this

1905
01:54:00,930 --> 01:54:02,630
this constant here

1906
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:06,130
the some constant data from because out

1907
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:09,030
and because of a whole bunch of sources

1908
01:54:09,070 --> 01:54:13,030
OK then we set the for each one of them

1909
01:54:13,030 --> 01:54:16,110
and each one of these to be and i n

1910
01:54:16,130 --> 01:54:17,590
will be

1911
01:54:17,610 --> 01:54:20,360
what is i would see here

1912
01:54:20,450 --> 01:54:21,740
if i said

1913
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:24,590
all the other beings to zero

1914
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:29,280
and i said all the other current sources except for that one is zero

1915
01:54:33,070 --> 01:54:36,260
what i'm saying is that

1916
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:42,110
the response here what i'm missing anything here is that

1917
01:54:42,130 --> 01:54:45,860
they don't all the other ones

1918
01:54:45,890 --> 01:54:48,910
what i'm missing

1919
01:54:48,970 --> 01:54:54,380
i exactly so far the current source i then the effect of this current as

1920
01:54:55,110 --> 01:54:58,320
and so i don't i there too

1921
01:54:58,360 --> 01:55:01,970
OK it's going to be some constant multiplying by

1922
01:55:02,030 --> 01:55:04,860
OK and that constant

1923
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,550
it's going to look like a resistor

1924
01:55:06,590 --> 01:55:07,760
right because

1925
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:11,410
this circuit contains current sources what it's also resistors

1926
01:55:11,470 --> 01:55:15,740
if a short of like what the sources and opened on the current sources what's

1927
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:17,760
left in here

1928
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:21,530
the whole caboodle full of the old of art

1929
01:55:21,550 --> 01:55:24,630
OK look like what some some distance are

1930
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:27,160
and that's what i did here

1931
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:29,720
OK so this is what we used to look like

1932
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:33,030
so far

1933
01:55:33,070 --> 01:55:35,740
so let's take a look at

1934
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:38,660
these components

1935
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:45,970
let's focus on these easy part first

1936
01:55:46,010 --> 01:55:49,820
what does this look like this component looks like an i

1937
01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:52,280
so the current

1938
01:55:52,430 --> 01:55:54,130
some resistance

1939
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:59,470
what's the given by simply giving the network and this current source and as you

1940
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:03,260
how do you measure

1941
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:04,570
what you would do

1942
01:56:04,570 --> 01:56:09,490
it is open all the current sources short of the water sources

1943
01:56:09,550 --> 01:56:12,410
what they all mean and then measure the distance

1944
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:16,740
OK so we understand the term

1945
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:19,450
what about this term here

1946
01:56:19,570 --> 01:56:21,650
because the units of the term here

1947
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:24,590
the big danger

1948
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:27,820
it's the voltage is the voltage

1949
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:29,030
i have the page

1950
01:56:29,110 --> 01:56:33,590
so this would be applicable pitch

1951
01:56:33,630 --> 01:56:37,150
OK and beautiful example of the tree

1952
01:56:39,110 --> 01:56:40,360
so what is that

1953
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:42,780
as far as this current i is concerned

1954
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:46,550
that's part of the skin and eyes concerned

1955
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:49,300
the rest of the universe

1956
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:52,490
as far as can socialize concerned the rest of the universe

1957
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:56,800
looks like it is an unwanted source beginning in some manner

1958
01:56:56,930 --> 01:56:59,650
and let me just call it bth

1959
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:05,680
for now and you know why second
