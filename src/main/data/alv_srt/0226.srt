1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,930
now i am a little weight wt it was i decided to write this

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,700
i can

3
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,910
i can write this

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,730
class and then i have by definition of art

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,330
i have

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,410
indicator function of

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,450
why the heck

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,000
a mistake

9
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,750
this is my

10
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,200
definition of

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,770
up here and the

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,430
now i can infer this

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,540
securities says

14
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,270
so exploited the

15
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,470
the existence of the inverse

16
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,040
function of the gradient to right now i have

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,180
now i have an incremental update

18
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,470
have it your way i inverse

19
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,350
of the

20
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,080
of the gradient i e

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,600
and for what they get by applied incremental update and then i think we can

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,560
compute the gradient of the result

23
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,450
so you can think of it as the basis

24
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,230
it's the basis

25
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,250
so there is a space in which and comparing in which

26
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,020
this is the space of the weight

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,060
and this is the space they used to make predictions

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,620
and that is the space of update

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,660
which is the basis of this art

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,600
which is the space that they use

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,770
in which i mean by up

32
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,640
OK and then the

33
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,290
and the gradient brings me

34
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,330
from this base of up this based on

35
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,370
and the interesting thing brings back

36
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,200
so all

37
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,200
i can now

38
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,040
i'm not well equipped to

39
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,330
you do things and hopefully understand something of the behavior

40
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,560
and i do that by

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,230
concentrating on the

42
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,930
on the morning of perfection

43
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:59,250
so complexity

44
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,810
the quality

45
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,220
support to very well here

46
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,720
and there is lots of nice properties that we can build on

47
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,870
so now i'm i'm interested in this but they here

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,200
i'm writing

49
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:34,600
just to make it clear

50
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,770
this is what i mean by by that just to be concrete

51
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,620
now it is nice to know that

52
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:57,600
if you take this to the inverse i want to get the gradient

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,730
of q

54
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,850
you see when working with great

55
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,500
where q

56
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,910
is the norm of the

57
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,950
the dual in the

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,020
of their

59
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,350
so it such that one plus plus one of the few

60
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,080
it but the one

61
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,200
so in case of equal to

62
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
remember people with common

63
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,520
bigger equipment

64
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,350
in case of equal to

65
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,930
the euclidean norm is set to one

66
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,020
either a i get the you w zero

67
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,160
last this thing where there

68
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,890
this thing sums up once the summer

69
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,890
and we only look at those times where the mistake happened this thing some of

70
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,540
the number of mistakes which i decided to be no with the

71
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,250
one the first year

72
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,410
this is the number of mistakes the number of times begins recounted just by looking

73
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,520
at the time

74
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,410
we're mistake occurred because in india that nothing happened and then

75
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,770
i can

76
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,430
here can be generalised because there's a mile

77
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,200
give me just because there's a minor and summing up over all things

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,630
but this is the indicator function for summing over all but it's fixing all this

79
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:25,560
says that how many mistakes happen over all and here's summing over all these

80
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,850
and i have no idea not LP u

81
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,890
this is the

82
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,310
you know it's there

83
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:41,680
so this is the cumulative hinge loss of u

84
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,430
i have something that contains number mistakes cumulative hinge loss

85
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,270
this inner product over there

86
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:00,180
so you see the difference is the number of states and this community hinge loss

87
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,270
which is an upper bound on the number of mistakes of you

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,290
so now

89
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,270
i finish shop

90
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,370
very quickly

91
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,620
by looking at

92
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,680
an upper bound on the on that on december fourteen

93
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,600
and i

94
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,750
work out the upper bound

95
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,330
very simply that out from again you p

96
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,470
that the

97
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:32,720
i think i should have that the former big the i understand how things go

98
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,950
so when i went to the occurrence they start from the

99
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:46,720
which is not transport by the end of the war my way all

100
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,910
the way down to zero

101
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,200
genetically little

102
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,720
OK now let's let's look at the other side

103
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,270
if you look at the other side of the square it's easy use question sure

104
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,040
to upper bound inner product norm

105
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,270
and then we work with the squared norman because we like it better

106
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,830
and you can weeks we expand this using

107
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:28,220
the at the rules

108
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,870
you seem

109
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,750
and then we just take the

110
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,740
expand the sum of the squares of some

111
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,950
then we just observe

112
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,060
that this thing is going to be negative

113
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,310
this quantity here

114
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,060
the margin

115
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,350
this quantity over here is the marginal

116
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,560
all of that depends on the current example and assuming that the that on the

117
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,620
that the aggregate percent made mistake and the mistake was made the margin had to

118
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,850
be negative but negative so we can lower bound upper bounded by

119
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,560
the recurrence terms

120
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,450
squared norm of x

121
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,540
he OK

122
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,480
OK now we are almost there

123
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,080
so now

124
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,540
i again we by the recurrence

125
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:14,770
spend the recurrence and so we get that generally get there

126
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:23,850
we can write it this way

127
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,200
so we have

128
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:42,040
bill insisting on those that were mistake happen so we expand the recurrence as many

129
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,930
times as many state

130
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,870
but this is

131
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,200
and we

132
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,020
we have this back this

133
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,080
that first year the multiply the mistake indicator function and we take the maximum

134
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,640
cool so now we know that this is the wrong

135
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,890
because they start from the iraq and we also know that this is the right

136
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,540
now we have a nice

137
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,350
the nice upper and lower bounds on the same quantity that takes into account the

138
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,970
mistake indicator function

139
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,830
and the law so we have a square here

140
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,480
we focused square here so we have adjust for the squares but we can we

141
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,200
can of course to solve the this

142
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,100
now if you saw before this what you get

143
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,450
this is the correct action court

144
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,830
thank you

145
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:47,470
right otherwise it will be a natural or these have proven that is the lower

146
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,080
because correctly

147
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,640
good now we saw

148
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,140
and we have the second equation was always get this bound here

149
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,640
some of the

150
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,390
so on but i don't know how much the function is going to vary within

151
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,600
the period

152
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,990
and actually when i think more about it i'm not sure appears like strictly periodic

153
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,810
is right right because could be that these periodic things actually look a little bit

154
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,990
different in the fifties than they do in year two thousand

155
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,030
that's it seems likely to me that could happen to multiply that by not term

156
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,700
here so if multiply two covariance functions again the covariance function or multiply that together

157
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,330
with the with another question to term which is just going to say well if

158
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,430
the point is are too far away from each other than that the covariance decay

159
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,620
writers joanna decay term say this strictly

160
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,580
periodic if x is close to prime

161
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,280
but if x is very close to very far away from ex-prime then maybe it's

162
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,850
not the same period maybe you forget about the correlation of very long legs and

163
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,450
i don't know what the length is

164
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,700
because there's no problem

165
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,240
OK so

166
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,910
i also when i

167
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,490
let me just so i also i also see that there some this on so

168
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,280
looks a little bit irregular like this a little bit sort of peak here and

169
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,180
this sort of funny trough here right so this seems to be an irregularity at

170
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,620
maybe a much

171
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,200
lower spatial frequency or maybe add lots of frequencies

172
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,810
i don't really know

173
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,600
rational quadratic

174
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,330
sounds like the right thing here so i don't know what they what the magnitudes

175
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,120
of that i don't know what the

176
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,390
what the alpha parameter is i don't know how many length scales that you've been

177
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,220
there and i don't know what the typical length scale of those is either so

178
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,030
there are no free parameters

179
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,450
and then lastly i have i have noise model so i would say well actually

180
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,430
i don't believe that my that my prediction will be right on the target there

181
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,990
might be some measurement noise here so i have an independent noise model with

182
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:48,030
variance here beta eleven and maybe also there will be some some short-term correlations in

183
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:52,600
the noise right because it might be so these are measured and how why somewhere

184
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,830
and it might be that you know the the weather that month you might influence

185
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,410
things and maybe if there's been a lot of storms this month you know might

186
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,990
be might be similar well the next one maybe there is little correlation could say

187
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:09,100
well let's also assume that for some very small lengthscale you also have a little

188
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,870
bit of extra call asian it could happen

189
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,560
so now i just write down my covariance functions to some of these contributions and

190
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,830
have eleven unknown parameters here

191
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,530
and my my

192
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,950
my total covariance function just be just going to be the sum of these different

193
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:34,830
the weights are just parameters for fight each of them has a primarily telling you

194
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,200
how strong is that contribution

195
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:42,220
one great OK so

196
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,280
when i use my i use my

197
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,490
my own little optimisation code and it doesn't understand constraints

198
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,870
so basically i square these things too

199
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,050
to make sure that even if my parameter that i can do

200
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,260
unconstrained optimization basically just a tiny tiny trick

201
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:05,350
actually what i actually what i do is i i i parameterize these by their

202
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,990
by the logarithms instead

203
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,180
so so slightly lying to you about exactly how this is done but you can

204
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,060
do little transformations of these like it doesn't really matter right at the end of

205
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,600
the day

206
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,240
we just interested in what this value is what you just have to have some

207
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,680
something to represent like i wrote square here because actually variance

208
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,350
all right so now you might say well

209
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,780
this all looks very well but this is a bit of a nightmare right because

210
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,700
i have a hugely complicated covariance function with lots and lots of parameters and this

211
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,010
will take me a long time to write down the program to do this

212
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:45,280
but during the fortunes situation that i read it

213
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,410
so if you

214
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:53,100
used to package that you also used in the in the practical sessions very

215
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,490
there little package that has the language for specifying covariance functions

216
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,290
so now i've loaded in my my data here

217
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,030
and the next thing i do is i

218
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,060
specify migrants function

219
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:11,410
and in this tiny language the covariance function is pretty much just lifting exactly the

220
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:18,470
these specification onto this so i think there are four different contributions here k one

221
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,280
is in this means

222
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,470
covariance functions also always start with c of e and this is squared exponential

223
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,120
isotropic does matter because only in one dimension doesn't the not next time here is

224
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,580
the current product of two terms one is quite exponential in one is periodic

225
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,760
and so on and so forth and my covariance function is just the covariance some

226
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,810
of these four contributions

227
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,660
OK so you can very easily specify things like that

228
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,350
and now what we're do now i i minimize the i find optimal hyperparameters so

229
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:58,530
i minimize the the marginal likelihood and it's computed by a function called TPR thousand

230
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,950
process regression

231
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:06,390
and here's the optimisation running on my very slow and clunky

232
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,470
that up here and i told it that he can evaluate the function for twenty

233
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,160
times OK this may be a little bit optimistic if you have eleven parameters so

234
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,640
in an industrial application i'll probably running for a few iterations more

235
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,350
but here in the interest of time

236
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,050
and then optimize in this space over these eleven parameters

237
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,720
in math the one thing about that is useful to follow the rules

238
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,280
so you posted

239
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,730
if x is the zero vector is supposed to take

240
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,170
there are over here

241
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,010
with y for you always get

242
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,880
so we're all

243
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,110
the zero vector is orthogonal to every

244
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,550
what i wanted

245
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,500
what i now want

246
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,040
think about it some

247
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,980
what does it mean

248
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,590
for me to say

249
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,270
that sums of space is orthogonal to some other

250
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,850
OK i've got it right this is where the five

251
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,400
definition of some

252
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,850
a team

253
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,200
i got a couple of days

254
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,320
and what it means for those guys to be or

255
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,520
it's just not sort of what the natural extensions

256
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,780
orthogonal vectors two orthogonal subspaces

257
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,160
and in particular

258
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,150
let's think of some orthogonal subspaces like

259
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,780
this law

260
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,140
i say in three dimensions

261
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,170
so the blackboard extended

262
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,170
to infinity right

263
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,480
playing a two dimensional subspace

264
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,520
it's a little

265
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,210
one but anyway

266
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,460
it's thinking that subspace

267
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:30,680
let me take the floor level

268
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,910
great stone face

269
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,470
and ninety on the billboard

270
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:40,810
so so

271
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,670
and of what they are doing right here

272
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,930
so the origin of the world

273
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,000
is the right

274
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,440
thereby giving linear algebra its proper important

275
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,810
one thousand place there's another one the war

276
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,980
are they are

277
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,010
what does it mean

278
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:17,130
producer prices to be orthogonal and that case are they are right

279
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,720
fifty percent

280
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:26,390
what does it mean meet

281
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,300
after that know what would

282
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,050
thank you all for coming

283
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,890
let me recap what we did last time

284
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,030
we started talking about source coding also known as data compression

285
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,470
we've been looking at toy examples

286
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:49,610
one example of redundant file first compress this is something is mainly zeros with just a few ones scattered

287
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,130
random so we at the bent coin

288
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,650
how should we can compress the file like at

289
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:04,730
well when you think about compression the claims were examining are shannon's assertions that's if you take log

290
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:05,860
base to

291
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,930
one over the probability of an outcome that's tells you

292
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,750
how much information content the outcome has got that's how long the message ought to

293
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,250
be associated with the outcome in bits as well as speak ideal message length

294
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,000
entropy which is the average of the shannon information content is claimed to be the

295
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,290
right way to measure the average information content

296
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,290
the third assertion that we've got and that we have sort approved last time is

297
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,080
the source coding theorem which says that if you get a very long string around

298
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,190
comes from

299
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,350
a random source identically distributed

300
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,380
then those outcomes can be compressed into roughly ten times the entropy bits

301
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,290
so we sought prove last time we have

302
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:51,940
did this

303
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:57,460
proof by counting the typical set we didn't actually do a general proof that's in the book

304
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,300
but what we did is we looked at the special case of the bent coin

305
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,910
where you toss it and times and get

306
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,740
many zeros and a few ones

307
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,570
hand there we all know what the typical set is you expect a get

308
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,840
if it was bent coin with bias if ten percent expect ten percent ones and

309
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,440
the typical set of strings is all the strings that have roughly ten percent ones

310
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,750
so in general

311
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,850
what the typical set means and this a defined concept

312
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,660
if you get a string and an independent outcomes from a source that's string

313
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,460
it is very likely to be in a typical set

314
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,960
the typical set elements all have roughly the same probability as each other

315
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,350
there are two to the end times the entropy

316
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,990
of them so the rest of the proof of the source coding theorem is well

317
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,970
just given aim teacher these guys

318
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,290
the number names

319
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,320
you'll need is to be an times the entropy so the length always will be and times entropy

320
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,070
and they incidentally all got roughly the same probability as each other which must therefore

321
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,760
be to to the minus end times

322
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:05,760
the entropy

323
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,220
so let's be

324
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,970
rough outline of the proof that the source coding theorem for general source and we did before the bent coin

325
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,280
looking at a long string of and

326
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:25,510
now comes hand the way we found ourselves at the proof was we imagined playing

327
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,240
the bent coin lottery we wanted to

328
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,840
win the lottery for the mafia boss

329
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,430
how much of his money did we need spend which tickets would be by

330
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,300
we found that big sackful of tickets and then we imagined writing new name for

331
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,740
each ticket on the reverse ticket we counted the number of tickets in the back

332
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,320
and we find had to trillion times entropy

333
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,580
so that's what we did last time i was a proof of the source coding theorem at least four

334
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,040
the bent coin

335
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,510
when i said the number of tickets in the bag is due to be end

336
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,130
times in is to the end of it

337
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,240
to to be

338
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,530
and timestamp plus a little bit

339
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,750
and that's a little bit is that with the fluctuations around these

340
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,250
thee mean that the typical number of old ones

341
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,530
and those fluctuations goes square root event where end is these length of three

342
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,150
the string so they get relatively small

343
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,360
compared to

344
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,030
this is the main term and age to

345
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,970
at his just a picture reminding you what a guassian distribution

346
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,570
looks like and you can get the probability

347
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,860
as small as you like the probability of failure as small as you like just

348
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,110
by adding a few extra square root events

349
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,310
a few extra standard deviations

350
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,390
maximize conditional

351
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,550
likely head

352
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,960
rather than the joint

353
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,340
that gives significantly better results

354
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,680
is the approach that taken

355
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,120
and i want to get to a rule based approach is so

356
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,080
for rule based undirected models

357
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,620
we have

358
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,300
some of the

359
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,840
work here

360
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,540
we had to mark

361
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,320
earlier in the conference

362
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,420
the approach is

363
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,590
we're going to

364
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:42,080
have a collection of formulas of first-order logic

365
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:46,540
and were associated with away

366
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,810
and together with this

367
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:55,420
at least in the basic set up a finite set of constants it defines a

368
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,800
markov network where

369
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,950
you have an grounding for each predicate in the MLN

370
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,870
and a feature for

371
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,660
each grounding of each formula f

372
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,830
in the MLN with the corresponding weight

373
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,790
as an example

374
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,260
if we have

375
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,280
the following set of rules so

376
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,560
we have

377
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,110
and whether or not there

378
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,240
the paper is high quality

379
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,290
whether or not

380
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,980
papers accepted

381
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,290
we have some information about

382
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,380
saying that

383
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,620
co-authors are

384
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,230
likely to be

385
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,670
have equivalent smartness

386
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,550
the definition

387
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,420
they were given the second

388
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,190
alice bob and p one

389
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,820
go through and

390
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,410
we instantiate

391
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:12,400
all of these

392
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,750
and make the following connections

393
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,190
this is the

394
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,250
underlying markov network

395
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,030
the underlying markov network has

396
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,420
these weights associated with it and now

397
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,900
do in france

398
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,450
and this

399
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,770
combination of doing

400
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,540
what i showed on that slide which was the

401
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,850
knowledge based model construction

402
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,810
together with

403
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,500
max what that

404
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,820
mcmc sampling

405
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,530
we're doing inference

406
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:05,640
inductive logic programming and likelihood discriminative training for doing the learning since then there's been

407
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,140
additional work should allow

408
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,680
you to put in

409
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,290
we have one an expert here

410
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,350
the only

411
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,580
so then

412
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,520
four discriminative training of ML and we have the

413
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,450
world expert here so

414
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,390
and i should say that there is the

415
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,900
the code for

416
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:57,660
and alliances available alchemy there's a pointer obviously from pedro domingos this page and also

417
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,180
there's the chapter and

418
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,840
the book on

419
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,540
and lands and there's

420
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:08,260
i think code and data as well available there

421
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,170
and so

422
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,540
OK to summarize

423
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,180
we have undirected approaches that can cannot

424
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,330
focus on this

425
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,170
symmetric non causal relationships

426
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,590
they support this collective classification

427
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,680
someone asked earlier what about combining these

428
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:44,190
approaches combining in undirected approaches and directed approaches at this point i haven't really seen

429
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,860
anything that combines them together i would say

430
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,650
there is a line of work on directed

431
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,740
unnormalized approaches

432
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,010
and those are

433
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,860
idle i let nature decide in a random way

434
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,080
one of the semantics of that

435
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,770
there's the same picture and one thing i can read off for example is this

436
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,050
so let's take e you know in the DAG

437
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:17,390
a variable is conditionally independent of all its non descendants given its parents haven't got

438
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:26,540
everything is an understandably so is independent of everything what parents it's got to stochastic

439
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,230
parents cindy and one regime indicator parent if

440
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,010
so conditional on those independent of everything else

441
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,300
that's what the dog is one of the things that i guess telling me

442
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,360
let's think about what i said well first of all

443
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:47,880
there are three the three possible suppose there all binary there are three possible values

444
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,200
for FEV if i put a fetus a zero then i'm setting it to zero

445
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,460
and it's got one point distribution that's that's not telling me anything i didn't know

446
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,190
a one point variable is independent of anything

447
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:05,130
no uncertainty so the only case where this bites is when f e exactly the

448
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,940
regime were not intervening on e

449
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:13,060
so in so i'm not in manipulating e and this is think about this conditional

450
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,720
distribution given c and d

451
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,720
when i haven't said a bit on the lower right around and that says that

452
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:24,700
independent of a and b that something when you from regular probabilistic tag

453
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,600
given CNT but also is independent all these other indicators

454
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,670
so it's not only independent of the values that a and b

455
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,660
it independent of whether any one of the variables for variables a b c and

456
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,800
d with set by me by nature

457
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:48,100
there's so many different regimes in which they come about which some combination of these

458
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:53,910
were set by the experimenter and others were just allowed to arise random and being

459
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,590
left to nature

460
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,980
so a whole lot of different regimes and i'm say that any one of those

461
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:05,490
regimes no matter whether intervention or observational this modular distribution the distribution of e given

462
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,540
c and d

463
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,380
is going to be the same

464
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:14,690
irrespective of how intervening all those things so that how pearl interpreters tag

465
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,800
it's beautifully represented i think when you put in these indicators because then you just

466
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,880
use the standard conditional independence semantics of dies and you see these things are properly

467
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,420
represented you don't have to write an extra story about them

468
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,780
described because there already is

469
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,780
buried in the DAG and you can dig them out

470
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,760
so the basic idea once you've done this is that every parent child distribution so

471
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,670
he given c and d is like a modular component it's constant across no matter

472
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,990
how i'm as long as i'm not actually fiddling with the itself

473
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:52,220
then that parent-child distribution is always valid no matter how i mean to be aware

474
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,510
my interview that means in particular that if i just take an observational regime simply

475
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,890
observe all these variables and work at the joint distribution

476
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,280
i could of course work out these parent-child distributions

477
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:12,600
i don't know exactly what happened in any kind of intervention regime because they are

478
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,270
fixed the only so

479
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:20,500
whenever a variable is not itself intervened on it just has one of these marginal

480
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,130
distributions that i've taken from observational data where it is intervened on well i know

481
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:29,890
what's happening anyway because i made it happen so i got the whole picture

482
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,910
paul pearlian DAG still with point interventions

483
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,960
so that's what we talked about so far

484
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,250
you just take going to a variable and you pointed out to value and you

485
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,080
assume that you've been successfully

486
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,100
and it takes on the value

487
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,850
and the whole that thing then suggest indicates how effective that will trickle through the

488
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:58,030
whole network because i can put that in and see what the overall distribution is

489
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,010
of any other variable

490
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:05,370
but it's interesting to think more complex kind of intervention so imagine there's your treating

491
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:09,340
a patient in hospital and over time

492
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,010
you are

493
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:18,010
observing various symptoms and measurements and signs on this patient temperature whatever

494
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,450
and then over time you reacting to that in deciding on a sequence of treatments

495
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:22,840
to give

496
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,000
and ideally at each point to look over your shoulder the history of the page

497
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,390
and look at this chart see how we've been doing and use of that information

498
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,450
to decide what to do next so very

499
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,370
toy example of that is where

500
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,990
there are two possible actions that can be applied to the patient a one a

501
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,240
there's an l is some you can observe on the patient so

502
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:55,940
so here am someone is you you inject so many ECC's some

503
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,280
and then you can observe

504
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:04,110
some response so much the blood can go down something like that and then the

505
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:07,700
next day on the basis of that information in my take no action

506
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:13,780
now i'm going to talk about various treatment strategies you can imagine a hospital drawing

507
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,610
up a plan of various treatment strategies that you might want to try out on

508
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:23,050
patient says if the additional blood it

509
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,040
so so

510
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,330
a one depends on treatment strategy that says that you know you look down what

511
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,140
might be pointing on the random thing just give so many cc's of of this

512
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,240
and did you could you could vary how many you give according to the strategy

513
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,620
and a two

514
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,800
well also the the dry the treatment you give the next day

515
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,650
well also

516
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:53,800
it will be determined by the strategy but slightly more complex way it says if

517
00:34:53,810 --> 00:35:00,680
you observe you've given so many ceases of the drug and the blood count going

518
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,870
down below such level in that case you give so many more good at some

519
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:09,780
complicated formula which is the light both these values

520
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:14,300
tells you what to do so you can imagine trying to assess treatment strategy

521
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:20,520
try to understand this is what would be the effect of bringing the strategy in

522
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,250
on the response y

523
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:30,960
there's another variable you may have noticed looking up here you this is an unobserved

524
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:39,080
so extra variable and there is a slight problem here in that the data i

525
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,820
guess i just going to the hospital

526
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,480
and it's not putting any strategies into effect the doctors are going around doing whatever

527
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,090
they want

528
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:52,640
OK what do you think is the interesting thing that doesn't depend on

529
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,270
exactly so that

530
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,650
the size of the output space doesn't really show up right

531
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,730
problem as it could be kind of infinite we don't know

532
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:07,270
but i mean we assumed its here in this argument right but it can be

533
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,900
arbitrarily large it doesn't show up here

534
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,530
so that is encouraging because it basically means right that even as we get to

535
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,670
very large

536
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,390
output spaces

537
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:24,170
you know we will this algorithm will still terminate after a finite number of steps

538
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,420
finite beings

539
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,430
small not dependent on the on the

540
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,810
output space cardinality k

541
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,000
now of course

542
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,850
we will not be getting so

543
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,900
you know i'm not claiming that we will be getting correct solution

544
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,430
we will be getting an approximate solution and the solution is approximate in the sense

545
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:52,310
that there will still be lots of constraints probably that violated just a tiny bit

546
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,120
right so that's important to know and then

547
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:55,940
you can

548
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:00,030
you so basically the solution that you will be getting is feasible right it's because

549
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:05,540
it's violating lots of constraints its solution to relaxation but you can actually

550
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,710
you can basically imagine that afterwards you just include increase your slack variables a little

551
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:15,860
and basically then you get sort of feasible solution right now then that is no

552
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,730
longer the optimum right now you get a feasible solution but not the optimum but

553
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:25,430
optimum you know somewhere in between writing the solution of the relaxation and the

554
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,420
projection two

555
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:33,590
the cimple project into a feasible solution by increasing this fact variables just by it

556
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,700
any questions

557
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,880
and this i have i have little justice get share of the theorem and some

558
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,870
lemma ten propositions from the paper that hopefully i don't have to look at but

559
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:52,310
if you're interested in what the ideas of the proof it works as follows the

560
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:57,360
case of the dual objective right so we have the primal problem in the dual

561
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,880
problem maximizing the dual we minimizing the primal

562
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,670
we know for this time for these types of convex quadratic programs that there is

563
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:10,730
no duality gap basically at the optimum of the solution of the primal and the

564
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:17,010
solution of the dual they both the objective functions will be the same so

565
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,070
the primal will be an upper bound on

566
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:26,630
the dual objective OK which is upper bounded by n times see that trivial upper

567
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:31,210
bound to just get by using zero weight vector right so the norm of that

568
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:36,650
is zero and then know you violate all margins by one OK so

569
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,660
alex set to one

570
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:42,280
and then you get and time c

571
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,650
OK it's just it's just an easy way to get an upper bound on the

572
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,590
prime and the prime is an upper bound on the door so this is also

573
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:53,590
an upper bound on the cases work with this very simple upper bound that the

574
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,000
dual cannot be bigger than n times c

575
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:04,870
what we show that furthermore is that each variable selection for and violated constraint

576
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,170
will increase the dual objective by some minimum and a minimum that is really bounded

577
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,420
from zero and it depends on epsilon OK so basically

578
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,780
whenever i choose the constraint

579
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,060
that's violated enough

580
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,930
and i included

581
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,840
the duo will go up by

582
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,830
something that is not in our attorney small

583
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,430
step by step that like can bounded away from zero

584
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:34,710
and that's kind of not too hard and this is a little bit hidden here

585
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,950
right so you can look at things of what is the gradient or the

586
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:46,170
of the dual projected into a new direction that you optimize anyway and so you

587
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:51,200
can you can figure out if you include another valuable corresponding to another constraint in

588
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,040
the primal

589
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,370
they include another very well in the door and you're allowed to optimize over that

590
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:59,260
much we actually game like how much would you go up and then the argument

591
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,810
is very simple right you you need to estimate the step size and you have

592
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,180
a total

593
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,420
and now

594
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,200
you know just divide the total by

595
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,320
so it's great once you've demonstrated once you have proven that this parallax works then

596
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,220
of course you can always use it to your advantage

597
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,710
notice that the moment of inertia

598
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:21,900
rotation about this axis which is not sourced centre of mass

599
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:25,200
is always larger than the one through december

600
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,990
if you have this and the great

601
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,120
always larger

602
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,100
there is a second theorem

603
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,440
sometimes comes in handy

604
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:40,860
and that only works when you deal with a very faint objects

605
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:45,050
and that is called the perpendicular

606
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,030
if you have some kind of a crazy object which of course we will never

607
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,120
give you will always give you square rig if you disk

608
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:03,470
but it has to be offended played otherwise the perpendicular axis theorem doesn't work

609
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,440
and suppose

610
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:10,330
i'm rotating about an axis perpendicular to the blackboard to that point

611
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:14,820
i call that the c axis sticking out to you that the positive axis

612
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,550
i can draw now any x y axis

613
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:21,630
well i please at ninety degree angles anywhere in the plane of the blackboard

614
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,300
i think one year

615
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,920
like all these acts

616
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,700
and i think one here

617
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,410
and i call that y

618
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:32,700
so c is pointing towards you remember i always choose a

619
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:39,130
right-handed coordinate system might x crosswise y is is always in the direction of the

620
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,460
i always do that

621
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,250
so you see that here

622
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:44,670
o extras y equals

623
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,250
now you can rotate this thin plate

624
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:51,400
about this axis you can also rotating about an axis

625
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,210
you can also rotate about the axis

626
00:41:54,250 --> 00:42:00,070
and then the perpendicular axis theorem which you book processing of just a few lines

627
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,320
tells you that the moment of inertia

628
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,700
rotation about

629
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,420
this axis here

630
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,630
is the same

631
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,410
at the moment of her moment of inertia for rotation about x

632
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,360
the moment of inertia for rotation about the axis y

633
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,620
and this allows you

634
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:21,200
in combination with the parallel axis theorem to find moments of inertia

635
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,300
in case that you have thin plates

636
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,490
which rotate

637
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,750
about axes

638
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,340
perpendicular to the plate or sometimes not even perpendicular sometimes

639
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:35,790
you can use if you know this you know this you can find that

640
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:40,350
so both useful and i in assignment seven i'll give you a simple problem so

641
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,080
that you can apply the

642
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,310
perpendicular axis theorem

643
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,820
there are

644
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,400
applications where energy is temporarily stored

645
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,350
in a rotating disk

646
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,090
and we call those this fly wheels

647
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,700
and the rotational

648
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,630
kinetic energy

649
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,590
can be consumed at a later time

650
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,090
so it's very economical

651
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,080
and this

652
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,560
rotational kinetic energy can then be

653
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,970
perhaps converted into electricity or in other forms of energy

654
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,000
and i really remarkably inventive

655
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,730
an intriguing ideas on how these

656
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,840
can be done

657
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:23,380
of course whether this practical depends on always emboldened sense

658
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,740
and to what extent it is economically feasible

659
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,520
but i have always even when i was a small boy i remember when i

660
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,220
was seven years it already occurred to me

661
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:38,570
all this heat that is produced when cars slender weights

662
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:39,690
all you're doing is

663
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,350
you produce heat you lose all that kinetic energy of your

664
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,550
linear motion whether somehow

665
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,120
that couldn't be

666
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,810
used in a more effective way

667
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,820
and this is what i want to discuss the issue now

668
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,880
and see where we stand this is actually being taken seriously by the

669
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,970
department of energy

670
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,430
so i want to

671
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,500
work out was you a

672
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,470
one example of a car

673
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,800
which is in the mountains

674
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:12,450
and which is going to go downhill

675
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,680
and the mountains are very dangerous

676
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:18,580
zigzag roads and so he can only go

677
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,480
she can only go very slowly

678
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,910
and then the maximum speed that

679
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:27,750
a person could

680
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:30,580
uses at most ten miles per hour

681
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,410
without killing

682
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,310
in more self which is about four meters per second

683
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,070
so here's your car

684
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:42,580
let's assume you start out

685
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:46,310
with zero speed and let's assume that the mass of the car will get nice

686
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,650
it just one thousand kilograms

687
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,600
so you example down this road

688
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,700
let's assume that the

689
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,090
height difference

690
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:02,420
h was given the number five hundred meters

691
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,970
you're right here at point p

692
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:08,290
and you later have to go back up again

693
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,110
what is your kinetic energy

694
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,320
when you reach point b

695
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,000
you have the speed of four meters per second

696
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,560
and she went down

697
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,370
you've been breaking all the time

698
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:22,420
one way or another you got rid of your speed

699
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,800
and that's all burned up the theory of the universe

700
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,690
so when you reach point b

701
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:32,970
you can edit energy at that point is simply one half MV squared

702
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,880
and is the mass of the car

703
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,360
but it is five hundred

704
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:42,030
i'm sixteen square so a thousand jewels

705
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,470
now compare this

706
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,220
with the work that

707
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:48,280
gravity the in bringing discard

708
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,530
that work

709
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,630
is MGH

710
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,320
MGH is staggering number

711
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,780
a thousand

712
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,220
times ten

713
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,720
times five hundred

714
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,470
that is five million joules

715
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:06,020
and all that was converted to heat

716
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:10,570
using the wakes it actually even gives you also wear and tear on the brakes

717
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,030
so we need is that perhaps way

718
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,960
that you can salvage did or maybe not all of it

719
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,560
may be part of it

720
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:18,830
and the answer is

721
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,780
there are weights

722
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,210
at least in principle there are ways

723
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:25,670
you can install

724
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:29,120
the disc new car which i will call them to fly flywheel

725
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,780
and you can convert

726
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,760
the gravitational potential energy

727
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,510
you can convert that to kinetic energy of rotation

728
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:40,080
in your flywheel

729
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,000
and to show it is not completely absurd

730
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,360
i will put actually in some numbers

731
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,210
suppose you had a

732
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,810
this in your car

733
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,510
which had a radius of half a meter

734
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,810
that's not completely absurd that's not

735
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,630
beyond my imagination that

736
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,320
the sizable this

737
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,800
and i give the modest mass

738
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,660
sort of the mass of the car is not going to be

739
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,790
too high

740
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:10,550
two hundred kilograms that's reasonable that will be still played only five centimetres thick

741
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:12,400
that's quite reasonable

742
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,860
and the moment of inertia of this this if i rotated about an axis through

743
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,420
the center perpendicular to the disk

744
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:24,310
moment of inertia we know now is one half of the capital and

745
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,830
are squared

746
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,740
and that equals twenty five

747
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,670
units kilograms if you're interested

748
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,130
meters script

749
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,710
so we know the moment of inertia

750
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,370
now what we would like to do is we would like to

751
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,560
convert all this

752
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,210
gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy of the disc

753
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:50,340
think of a clever way you can couple that people have succeeded in that

754
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,180
then you really would like

755
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:53,220
one half

756
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,020
omega square

757
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,580
we would really like that to be

758
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,790
five times ten two to six two

759
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:02,740
so that immediately tells you

760
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,330
what omega should be for that disk

761
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,750
you find and if put in new numbers which is trivial

762
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,230
you find that omega

763
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,670
it's about six hundred thirty two

764
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,350
radiance per second

765
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:16,510
so the frequency of the disc

766
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:17,760
it's from the

767
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:19,920
hundred revolutions per second

768
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,110
i don't think that is particularly

769
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,430
so as you will come down the hill

770
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:29,010
i implicitly defines a mapping function

771
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:32,840
but do not need to bother i never know what the mapping function is i

772
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,630
don't care about it OK

773
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,910
it implicitly does it OK

774
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:42,090
so i'm saying about representation of that data can be achieved particularly for not separable

775
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:46,800
by mapping across the high dimensional space and that's why mapping function and what i

776
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,110
must do is mapped a dot product OK

777
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:07,010
know we're not being not necessarily five

778
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,780
there is there's an assumption be talking about

779
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,430
going to do it this way i going

780
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:16,160
x goes to phi x

781
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,590
there is a requirement for me to be able to do that

782
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:22,050
one requirement

783
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:27,070
or automatically is a space map into must have adopted so must be an inner

784
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,200
product space

785
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,200
and must actually be pre hilbert space indeed

786
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,990
because of the conductivity is a hilbert space which was defined earlier

787
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:39,930
so there are restrictions on the space can map into so i can't have total

788
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:45,130
the reality in doing that have a high degree flip liberality as point actually

789
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,180
OK but

790
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,590
o to convince you can do this mapping the mapping functions fi

791
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:53,840
and i've just said this high dimensional spaces in general to call the feature space

792
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:59,180
and must be a hilbert space because there must be a concept inner product can

793
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,530
in some places they actually could be pre hilbert space OK in the product space

794
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:08,360
but i would just say help space

795
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:13,510
what is the mapping function just said you don't need to know

796
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,240
what it is because

797
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,660
this match

798
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,880
dot product the subject here

799
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:22,410
all set equal to the kernel kernel will just be

800
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:23,820
the mapped

801
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:26,510
data that x is OK

802
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,280
now i can define

803
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:34,180
by defining those kyle's i'd implicitly define a mapping function

804
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,550
but i do not need to know what a mapping function is in some simple

805
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:41,820
cases like if i do a polynomial time mapping i can actually work out what

806
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:48,130
phi is generality i don't know what it is i don't care either because it

807
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:51,410
provided some restrictions on the choice of kernel

808
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,930
then then it's all OK

809
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:57,760
so what is the mapping relation as a here in fact we do not need

810
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,300
to know the form of this mapping

811
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,910
because is implicitly defined by the choice of kernel

812
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,470
like that

813
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:22,530
yes it's it's some sort of what is function functional

814
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:27,970
a function which maps my data one one to some that high dimensional vector

815
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:30,510
in some sort of unique way OK

816
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:32,240
i don't know

817
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,320
yes data

818
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,700
i data is mapped according to functions

819
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,360
five acts to this high dimensional space

820
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,010
a lot of people get disturbed and i really need to know what the phi

821
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,640
is i'm just saying

822
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,090
that no because

823
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:54,050
the i don't have total freedom of choice about what kernel there are restrictions on

824
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,280
coming onto shortly

825
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,180
i suppose i define my kernel to be the subject here

826
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,260
x one x two

827
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,130
is equal to gaussians

828
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,950
OK have premature and talk about later

829
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,160
but if i choose that is why kernel

830
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:13,380
they're implicitly defines what the phi is

831
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,970
but i need to catch

832
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,900
one is OK

833
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,860
now there are various choices for

834
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:21,820
kernels OK

835
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:24,380
i'll give you a typical example of the kernel

836
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:29,090
and also the restrictions that apply to kernels

837
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,090
if i choose this kernel

838
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:36,630
this is a good choice usually often uses the colour cast in co

839
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,700
michael an RBF kernel

840
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,380
this is one choice popular choice

841
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:45,990
another type of kernel might choose might be a polynomial OK

842
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,450
the lights source

843
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,470
other popular choices

844
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:53,640
now when you notice if i choose a kernel

845
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,300
and this again as RBF time kernel

846
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,800
indeed what i'm doing is implicitly

847
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:03,910
giving you an RBF network probably heard of RBF networks

848
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,510
if i choose a polynomial kernel

849
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:09,110
i'm give by some statistics

850
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:15,260
another choice and go for really use actually even give it is attention choice for

851
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:19,010
so there is that it is divided by the sum of the desert is

852
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,920
and i thought those

853
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:28,070
and i'm going to use those values in my computations when i do radiation

854
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,760
so this is what we do here

855
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,170
and regarding the rewards which is really the rewards

856
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,840
with that's it

857
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:41,430
don't have to do anything and then we call the iteration

858
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:47,920
so the iteration is going to be around for kentucky iterations to capture that he's

859
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,360
going to be tuned in some way

860
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,780
and on this

861
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,220
the discrete problem having and and

862
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,880
the discrete states

863
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:04,030
and the transition from this therapy had nice computed situation

864
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,090
so far so good so

865
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,450
we are going to get some values

866
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:13,200
at those spots right so value iteration is going to return us

867
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:17,550
value function that is defined for

868
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,050
finite problems

869
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,260
so we discretize the problem

870
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,110
we computed let's see

871
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:27,780
a good approximation of the optimal value function for this this that problem

872
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,280
now the question is what's next

873
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,590
so if you want to

874
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:35,950
like the first thing that you might want to try it just to see if

875
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,490
you can break the curse of dimensionality

876
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:43,920
just to compute some values and some other parts of the state space

877
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,700
because that's required

878
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,740
if you

879
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,860
so you don't forget we are not interested in the values at this point of

880
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,400
interest and the values

881
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,590
anywhere in the state space

882
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,610
so you pick some other value

883
00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:00,720
sorry you pick some other states in the state space and you are interested in

884
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,090
the value of that so what do you do

885
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:06,780
you just do one step further by iteration so this is what you do right

886
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,450
so this is the game

887
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:10,280
the same idea

888
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,110
fusing weighted importance sampling

889
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:16,970
and these are the values that we have computed so far

890
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:22,280
OK so this is the value function return for the discrete problem here

891
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,470
so that we live in in input is very

892
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,190
just do this

893
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,470
approximate about one of the right

894
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:34,950
just a single look at computation

895
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:40,190
and so that's going to be the value that we return that state

896
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,590
and the question is if this is going to work

897
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:47,510
so let's assume that the state space is just the unit call q for the

898
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,260
sake of simplicity action space is finite

899
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,320
and to be on the safe side

900
00:55:54,510 --> 00:56:00,010
let's assume that p and r are lipschitz continuous and bonnet so this is kind

901
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:04,090
of the same set of and the piece that was considered

902
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:07,610
by showing and tsitsiklis in the lower and

903
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,610
and then run proves

904
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:13,090
if you do the computation

905
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:16,820
but the previous are given and the desired

906
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:20,880
at a certain state taxes denoted by greek the

907
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,760
so and that's

908
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,360
and you can disagree on the difference

909
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:31,630
this aspect of the state space and an expectation of that and then this is

910
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:35,260
bonded by an expression that looks like this

911
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:40,650
so what you see here for the good news and the very striking feature of

912
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:41,760
this is

913
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:42,470
is that the

914
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:46,930
dimensionality doesn't appear in an exponent right

915
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:52,590
that c constant is that so that's probably dependent then let's talk about that later

916
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:55,900
but the dimensionality is just appearing in a linear manner

917
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,950
so this is really good news so

918
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:02,090
it seems that these are given six keeping the curse of dimensionality

919
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:06,740
the other side this is denoting the number of actions so if you have a

920
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,240
the i just use this model is not patient in the north the number of

921
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,300
elements of the set so that

922
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,470
the size of the actions at least part of

923
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,200
five four four

924
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:23,740
and you get the stopping this was usually you see one over one minus race

925
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,360
to some

926
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:33,110
the the entrance to the good news is of course that the is going down

927
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:37,400
two or zero if you include is the number of samples

928
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,520
so that it does not superfast but it's good enough so it's not one over

929
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,470
squared off and that would be

930
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:49,740
the rate of montecarlo it's somewhat slower but seems to be OK

931
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,840
so it seems that there is no curse of dimensionality

932
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,470
can go to the beach

933
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:02,530
OK so

934
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:06,450
quite a few questions so

935
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:11,170
this is going to so why is history so can we have result for planning

936
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:13,150
OK so now i have two

937
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:15,130
look up if i opened

938
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,630
i opened the representation so i two two actions of this presentation so i have

939
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:20,630
some slight

940
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:22,950
there's nothing the printed proceedings

941
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:26,650
for good reasons because that that's agrees

942
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:31,360
i'm going to use to test your knowledge what you want

943
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:40,800
my name is that all the time will be used in the

944
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,370
in nineteen

945
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,550
there you see

946
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:01,410
you use the shares

947
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,990
four presenting my work

948
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:10,370
is related to these this machine learning techniques

949
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:15,650
we study the summer school

950
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:18,620
my you might want know

951
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,090
falls which very by

952
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,370
more on the on the back

953
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:27,090
so so i think it's very interesting for

954
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:30,880
at least some of the people in the audience to see

955
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:35,490
as many as possible of

956
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:39,980
thirty years of research

957
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:43,260
such different techniques are used

958
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:49,620
so my my searches old standing

959
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:56,920
the motion so replacing the emotions human emotions based on the

960
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:04,110
on the environment on the current site so kind of context of emotion recognition what

961
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:06,410
does it mean when

962
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,800
imagine that

963
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,800
we should also have some

964
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,320
it is

965
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:19,460
through which we get different the information from the one so we we can communicate

966
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,540
with the environment and what we also get

967
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:28,330
feel so we provide information get information so

968
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:33,380
if we think vision and a new what it is

969
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,190
i don't know

970
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,780
such an

971
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,780
and assume automatic approach for

972
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:46,910
emotions would have take into account this kind of projects so

973
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:55,450
basically we need to revise emotions from the problem of human emotions from one video

974
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:02,940
well and secondly we have to utilize emotions from most speech from the of

975
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,190
this would be the

976
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,240
some of the areas

977
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:15,870
such automatic systems for recognizing emotions b

978
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,350
very useful after sonication said control

979
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:25,020
solicitation access control sort of

980
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,630
so there are no

981
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,610
you will be

982
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:32,800
the human interaction in washington nationals

983
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,230
user friendly

984
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:40,090
o interfaces interfaces are are are are one

985
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:47,720
so know that

986
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:51,120
this is another project b

987
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:52,330
what was it

988
01:01:52,340 --> 01:02:00,110
it was the

989
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:04,790
behaviour of fulfilling the in the same way as something the behaviour of the drivers

990
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,570
while driving the car also the behaviour of what

991
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:10,240
to the

992
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,890
the army

993
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:20,540
when the behaviour of such and such by this was that it already

994
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:26,310
earl behavior that might be made according to individual

995
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,530
OK so

996
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:32,960
i was trying to do all the state of the much

997
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:37,360
these the most important it would be

998
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:38,410
one of of

999
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,100
our approach is for last

1000
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,760
was in favour of fish expressions

1001
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:45,940
for from the things

1002
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,340
a face detector is

1003
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,750
o thing

1004
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:57,200
one sequence of people

1005
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:04,270
there a step by step frame by frame coalition

1006
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,880
it is necessary

1007
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,130
for each frame

1008
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,290
this kind of

1009
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:09,910
so far does

1010
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:12,430
i wanted so far

1011
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:13,880
the faces

1012
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,490
are needed to be

1013
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:18,110
detected so the location

1014
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,300
the size

1015
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,440
for each face possible future

1016
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,820
artist is exactly

1017
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,250
for the models

1018
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:34,280
i i've on and then

1019
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:38,260
this this approach i mean

1020
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,980
this is that what we don't stand four four o

1021
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:45,490
of faces more than there are some

1022
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:49,380
some some landmarks some points on the face key points on the face

1023
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:51,150
based on those

1024
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:58,330
points on the location the action vision expressions can be normalized

1025
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,320
it's the same thing

1026
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,570
from the

1027
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:10,580
i i think the point of view the technologies that use

1028
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:14,830
it right the use of force

1029
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,940
the original features

1030
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:19,730
the size twenty four one four

1031
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:22,660
if we have to get all the

1032
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:30,320
one seven four o for the entrance to just be to have the size of

1033
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,930
the DB size one hundred

1034
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:34,170
sixty two

1035
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:37,830
thousands more than these features

1036
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:42,210
so i think it's a very very big so of features

1037
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:46,510
speaking about this

1038
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,920
the religious features

1039
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,280
they are quite

1040
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,340
efficient there's

1041
01:04:53,970 --> 01:05:00,370
having started his recently and i consider the issue

1042
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:03,680
to here and that will be in the original canonical form and i said so

1043
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,300
there's just slightly simpler to get here with i want to completely fill the screen

1044
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:11,900
with three parameterizations but you can take this is homework for yourselves and see that

1045
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,220
yes you can easily get the by two and the by two in each and

1046
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:19,630
then we're back with unit directly with omnidirectional line

1047
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:24,470
OK so there is this limitation on regularity so we should probably worry about this

1048
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,460
we should go back to the problems that we were thinking about yesterday

1049
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:32,000
and ask well actually do those problems meet the regularity

1050
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:37,310
conditions so for example we have the icing prior

1051
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:41,360
on binary variables neighbouring binary variables here so

1052
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:46,230
that satisfy the regularity condition or did not

1053
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:48,110
or you reckon remember the

1054
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,600
think about the off diagonal cost that cost when

1055
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:56,760
the two neighbours different in the diagonal cost off diagonal cos got beat

1056
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,840
the diagonal cops seven a

1057
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,920
all the diagonal cost here when the two neighbours

1058
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:04,830
the same have the same label

1059
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:05,920
i'll cost

1060
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,690
what it in this

1061
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:14,630
zero isn't just zero because it xk and co-founder equal cycle cost given easier what

1062
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:17,150
about the off diagonal cost

1063
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:18,820
what are they

1064
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:20,720
one gamma or whatever

1065
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:23,930
so the and provided cameras positive

1066
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,430
he was in our original models

1067
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:31,530
then the off diagonal costs of each gamma i also zero so

1068
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:35,630
some of the optimal cost to go in the summer i dug across is zero

1069
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:37,680
and two gamma is indeed great here

1070
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:42,430
here we can use the ising model

1071
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:47,840
without fear of reprisal what about the was the more elaborate

1072
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,210
ising model you remember the one that has

1073
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:52,680
costs modulated by

1074
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:57,750
contrast so now we the contrast you this is this was when the prior

1075
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:02,190
because the icing was surprised i got messed up by bringing data into it which

1076
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:04,270
means it's not really a prior anymore

1077
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,720
and so now we have this modified so what about this one

1078
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:13,170
does this meet the regularity condition or did not

1079
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:14,400
what you think

1080
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:16,140
we take a vote on it

1081
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:21,460
and we think it doesn't meet the regularity condition

1082
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,430
how many think it does meet america

1083
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,720
and the constraint on this voting process which is that the sum of the s

1084
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:31,910
is in the nose has to equal the number of people in the room

1085
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,150
so how everything no

1086
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,410
it doesn't make

1087
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:38,170
think yes

1088
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:48,360
i know her and i think that this is you know to state problem not

1089
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:55,480
well because it because i mean this term here just has the effect of modern

1090
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:57,430
modifying gamma

1091
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,860
four you know on the site by on five basis

1092
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,790
and since this exponential still positive

1093
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:09,230
then it's it's as if i had a gamma kk primed inside the

1094
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:12,280
the sum here that would make it

1095
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:16,140
so yes it still find it was done in good shape

1096
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:18,030
OK so

1097
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:22,670
we will come across problems where there are interesting and whether submodularity condition is not

1098
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:30,500
met yet

1099
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:34,930
is this a well

1100
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:37,880
the ferromagnetism is

1101
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:40,620
captured by this energy

1102
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:43,360
and then and this energy we now seen is

1103
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:46,980
submodular any

1104
01:08:55,730 --> 01:09:01,940
i think you know it could mean using using energy is the energy represents a

1105
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:06,900
mathematical ferromagnetic any ideas about i as a physical paramagnetic to do some more fancy

1106
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:13,880
things but you know this is a mathematical idealisation of experiments

1107
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,950
so now a little variation on the theme remember

1108
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:23,080
how we did segmentation earlier and

1109
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,100
resisted the temptation to see

1110
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,250
the image is here in the segmentation

1111
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:35,020
so is a try map style

1112
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,620
and you do the segmentation you get ahead

1113
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:43,790
with some of the stuff and remember previously with the the guy who was playing

1114
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:46,390
the rows of A. and this

1115
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,660
3 by 6 matrix have 6

1116
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:59,240
and components of the the column spaces in R &

1117
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,400
and the null space of A transpose

1118
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:08,260
I see that this force space is already getting

1119
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:10,920
2nd goal

1120
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:18,790
second-class citizen treatment it doesn't deserve that it should be there it is there and

1121
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:20,660
shouldn't be squeezed

1122
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:23,780
the null space of A transpose

1123
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:26,000
well if the null space of had

1124
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:32,230
vectors with components the null space of A transpose will be in R and I

1125
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:35,500
want to draw a picture of the 4 space

1126
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:45,970
OK area therefore space

1127
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:47,140
the but

1128
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:52,230
OK let me put

1129
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:54,450
n-dimensional space over on this side

1130
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:01,760
which were the subspaces in R and the null space was

1131
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:04,620
and the row space what

1132
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,880
so here we have the following

1133
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:11,640
can I make that picture of the row space

1134
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:19,490
and can I make this time a picture of the nullspace

1135
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:26,340
that's just meant to be a sketch to remind you

1136
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:29,420
that very on this

1137
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:31,990
which is at the heart of what

1138
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:35,640
type of vectors are unit vectors with component

1139
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:40,090
over here in that in in society

1140
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:44,850
consisting of vectors with an components is the column space

1141
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,730
and what I'm calling the

1142
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:58,730
null space of A transpose those are the ones with an example

1143
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:05,880
to understand these spaces is are is our job

1144
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:13,760
because by understanding those places we know everything about this half of linear algebra

1145
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:16,660
what 0 I mean by understanding those

1146
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:18,880
I would like to know

1147
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,730
a basis for those

1148
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:29,730
for each 1 of those spaces how would I create construct basis what systematic way

1149
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,280
would produce a basis

1150
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:35,350
and what's the dimension

1151
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:41,950
the effect that's of it

1152
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:49,640
so for each of the 4 spaces I have to answer those questions

1153
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:51,850
however I produce a basis

1154
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,240
and then which has a somewhat long wants a

1155
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:58,310
and what's the dimensions

1156
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:01,690
which is just a number so it has a real short answers gonna give you

1157
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:04,490
the short answer 1st I shouldn't do it by

1158
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:13,360
I can tell you is the dimension of the column space

1159
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:16,980
I may start with this guy wants its dimension I have an M by M

1160
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:20,270
the dimensions or

1161
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:23,780
of the column space

1162
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:27,140
what is the rate of

1163
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:30,620
of the

1164
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:34,330
we actually got to that at the end of the last lecture

1165
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,710
but only for an example

1166
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:38,230
so I really have to say

1167
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:44,900
OK what's going on there I should produce a basis

1168
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,520
and I just want to see how many vectors I needed on that basis and

1169
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,450
the answer will be all

1170
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:53,730
actually do

1171
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:56,060
before I get the the others

1172
01:13:56,090 --> 01:14:00,330
what's the basis for the column space

1173
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:04,590
that we've done all the work of row reduction

1174
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:07,140
identifying the pivot columns

1175
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:11,880
the ones that have pivots the ones that end up with pivots but now I

1176
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,780
the maximum likelihood is

1177
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:19,010
basically reinterpreting these are functions has probability models now

1178
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:21,500
maximum likelihood them

1179
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:25,810
we start with an error function like this is a quadratic function

1180
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:27,560
and we

1181
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,930
what we imagine is the

1182
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:31,540
we reinterpret

1183
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:34,680
what's going on as that we're seeing data given by

1184
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:36,620
why which is a function of x

1185
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,610
be equal to this

1186
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:46,270
again this basis function class at ceylon where epsilon is some noise now i think the the

1187
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:51,830
the history the development of this idea of noise is fascinating and really the main person

1188
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:55,280
is class

1189
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:01,050
he is the person that i mean i guess when you were a mathematician or

1190
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:03,470
physicist whatever you wanna call him in those days

1191
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:08,200
you were interested in everything that was going on so he's not only interested in

1192
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:12,630
probability theory and he does this crucial work in the eighteenth century on

1193
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:15,990
deciding wether guys english or not

1194
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:17,270
but he also

1195
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:18,990
he is interested in

1196
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:24,270
what really i think is driven forward a lot of research from the plants certainly within

1197
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:27,910
europe is this nasty split between

1198
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:34,200
new kaon europe which is centered around like it's a new claiming priority for calculus

1199
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:35,900
and you're really

1200
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:37,100
you can really

1201
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:44,660
loses out from because a lot of the really interesting mathematicians at the time are in europe for example

1202
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:50,450
you've got the new release an oiler who are also inspired by light it's

1203
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:56,660
um land a what those people are interested in is taking this new understanding of physics

1204
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:02,700
and inferring things about the data newton doesn't really do then you can doesn't say okay now i described how

1205
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,210
these things work let's

1206
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:08,320
for the massive this let's do i mean you

1207
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:13,560
he doesn't know about the people really take it forward i think in particular are low class and gas

1208
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:16,860
and le plus is particularly interesting because

1209
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:19,860
they got this problem and in fact i've got this

1210
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:23,180
slide a few steps ahead

1211
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:25,420
it is probably more interesting the slides there

1212
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:28,640
this is the problem

1213
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:33,410
so they want to do in fact linear regressions may be linear but we can

1214
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:35,300
think of it in linear regressions

1215
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,840
thereby basis is taken from newton's laws so they are often working with a sinusoid

1216
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,680
or a cosine basis that they

1217
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:47,130
so newton's equations for some planetary oscillation and now they want to know

1218
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:48,670
what the

1219
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:52,320
right weighting these bases are so they are doing very often

1220
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:59,130
linear regression system but the basis there is physical it's coming from on understanding the universe

1221
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,450
so they got these two data points in a linear space

1222
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:05,950
so these might be to observations so counts is famous for

1223
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:08,290
predicting where this

1224
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,560
dwarf planet

1225
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:16,430
i astronomers said well astronomer common name the astronomers had identified answer is but it

1226
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:18,090
passed behind the sun and was lost

1227
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:24,670
there with this hunt defined series again and gauss predicts where it should be a year later

1228
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,000
and they look there and they see it

1229
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:33,070
and the way he claims retrospectively potentially in order to claim priority at least squares

1230
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:34,630
he did is by least squares

1231
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:39,490
so he's trying to fit the parameters of this orbit inspired by

1232
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:42,670
newton's equations some observations

1233
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,290
the original discoverer series fragment

1234
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:48,210
so he did make observations you just got these observations

1235
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,960
now i can't remember how many

1236
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:54,330
three parameters are are there's probably the massive planet and a few other things

1237
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:55,530
some unknown

1238
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:57,470
but the basic idea is

1239
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:01,720
in this case let's assume this is our model we got to free parameters

1240
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:04,830
offset andy gradient

1241
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:08,350
we only need to observations

1242
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:11,710
in order to determine the gradient of the line

1243
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:15,450
andy offset so we can fix our model with two observations

1244
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,950
but he discovered series made more than two observations which is very inconvenient

1245
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:31,840
because this is the third observation there question then was and this is a big debate how to deal with

1246
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:36,300
this third observation because you have three observations ant

1247
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:37,890
two unknowns

1248
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:46,620
they did things like compute the parameter for every couple combination the observations and take the median they didn't know

1249
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:52,430
they didn't believe for example in the mean they didn't believe that if you just

1250
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,440
sum up a bunch of error-strewn observations

1251
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,500
that you should get an answer that is better

1252
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,550
because they didn't know

1253
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,400
the principle that if you some

1254
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:05,120
across variables the variance reduces

1255
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:07,880
they that's clearly wrong thing to do philosophically

1256
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:12,630
if you've got a series measurements with errors you should try and work with the

1257
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:14,690
measurements we have the have no errors

1258
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:21,230
she should pick to measurements the one which have the best no errors and you should that those two only

1259
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:26,500
and the way they talk about doing is stating every possible combination measurements

1260
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:27,550
and seeing

1261
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:32,390
taking criteria like what the median values were from bat and then using the two

1262
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,580
sets that gave the median values these sort criteria

1263
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:38,310
so what missing

1264
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,060
they were missing models the uncertainty

1265
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:45,480
and i want to use this a lead-in to bayesian inference later

1266
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:52,180
but for the moment because it's where you put uncertainty that key is undetermined an overdetermined system sorry

1267
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:57,360
it's an overdetermined system and we're going deal with an overdetermined system by introducing stochasticity

1268
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:03,020
interestingly we're also gonna do with underdetermined systems where you may only have one measurement

1269
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,890
associated with linear regression by stochasticity later

1270
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:09,490
but where we put them and what they called somehow seems to be different

1271
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:14,990
with two unknowns and few observations you've got these formulae hear

1272
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:19,860
and you'll learn how to do simultaneous equations and solve them and see

1273
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:24,640
the third system the formalism overdetermined system

1274
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:26,020
and here's the trick

1275
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,770
slack variables

1276
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,390
as robert my call it

1277
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:38,040
so someone know this is a corrupting variable that comes from the fact that you

1278
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:42,270
are acknowledging that you're not taking account for everything that could possibly happen in your

1279
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:47,610
so you're not taking account in the case of observations planets of the

1280
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,750
different motions in the atmosphere which may be corrupt or perhaps some set up here

1281
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,260
experiment which is wrong and so this is

1282
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:56,350
the error

1283
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:02,750
which is how things departing from newton's equations so these bits would be representing newton's

1284
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:07,760
equations in this series case and these bits are representing all the crap that happening

1285
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:09,600
that is not part of your model

1286
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:15,370
because we recognise as noise but it's really important acidic go back to the beginning

1287
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,310
i want to talk about light

1288
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:22,180
light is an electromagnetic phenomenon

1289
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:25,580
and already in the sixteenth century

1290
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:29,750
way before maxwell model studies were done

1291
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,030
of the interaction

1292
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:34,050
i was wondering

1293
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:35,820
and with glass

1294
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:39,870
the kind of experiments that were done

1295
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,980
it follows

1296
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,890
so this is rare

1297
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:48,160
i call that medium one

1298
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:50,360
and this is water

1299
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:51,760
for the medium

1300
01:21:53,230 --> 01:21:55,730
and light beam

1301
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:56,980
that strikes

1302
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,970
this surface

1303
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:01,230
light comes in like so

1304
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:03,400
and i define

1305
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:05,860
this angle is the angle of incidence

1306
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,440
and i call that they don't want this is the normal to the surface

1307
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:12,660
recall that the angle of incidence

1308
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:16,230
i will say now that some of the light

1309
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:19,810
is reflected

1310
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:22,720
reflecting originality lion

1311
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:25,110
and some of that light

1312
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,950
goes into the water

1313
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,440
recall that the refracted

1314
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,220
refracted was an arts and richard

1315
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:34,440
and this angle

1316
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,590
we'll call

1317
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:39,330
data two

1318
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,450
and it was the dutchman

1319
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:43,750
billboard smell is

1320
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:47,920
who in the seventeenth century

1321
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,060
i found three rules that govern the relation between the three

1322
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,200
light beams

1323
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:56,440
the first one is that

1324
01:22:56,450 --> 01:22:59,670
there's been this beam and this being in one plane

1325
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:00,750
as you see

1326
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,420
this is my plane on the blackboard

1327
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:06,420
the second thing that he found this angle

1328
01:23:06,450 --> 01:23:07,890
theta free

1329
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:11,810
which is called the angle of reflection is the same as the angle of incidence

1330
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:14,700
that was known before him of course

1331
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:18,640
and then the third one which is the most surprising one which is called after

1332
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,600
it is called snails law

1333
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:24,400
although his name was snell

1334
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:27,890
is that the sign of one

1335
01:23:27,890 --> 01:23:30,360
divided by the sine of data two

1336
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:33,050
if we go from air to water

1337
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:34,730
and that ratio

1338
01:23:34,730 --> 01:23:37,170
it is about one point three

1339
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:39,890
to go from air to glass

1340
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:45,570
it's a little higher like one point five or so

1341
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:49,180
he introduced the idea of index of

1342
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:52,140
fraction which i will call

1343
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:54,580
and so immensely

1344
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:06,600
four vacuum index of refraction for definition is one

1345
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,990
but it's very closely the same

1346
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:09,880
in air

1347
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:12,850
always treated as one in air

1348
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:15,170
and in water

1349
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:17,460
the index of refraction

1350
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,200
is approximately one point three

1351
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,850
and in glass depending upon what kind of glass you have

1352
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:27,360
it's about one point five

1353
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:30,050
and so we cannot amend this

1354
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,770
small snails law

1355
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:33,480
by writing here

1356
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:37,880
and two divided by n one

1357
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:42,850
and one being the index of refraction of the medium where you are

1358
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:46,010
you incident beam that's why i put one here

1359
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:48,830
and to being the index of refraction

1360
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:51,580
of the medium where you're travelling through

1361
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,980
you refracted into this medium

1362
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:56,920
so you see indeed that since what is one point three

1363
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,320
and air is one

1364
01:24:58,330 --> 01:24:59,790
that this ratio

1365
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:05,330
four after water is one point three and this is called smells law

1366
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:08,830
and it is immediately obvious that if you go from air to water

1367
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,170
or you go from air to glass

1368
01:25:11,170 --> 01:25:15,360
that angle theta two is always smaller than the angle theta one

1369
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:17,150
because this number is larger

1370
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:18,420
then one

1371
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:20,760
but if you go from water to air

1372
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:22,070
and the situation

1373
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:25,400
and that's what i want to

1374
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:27,080
address now that's actually

1375
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,250
quite interesting

1376
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,830
so now

1377
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:34,090
my medium one

1378
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:37,010
is now warmer

1379
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:40,020
and i mean two

1380
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:41,540
there's no air

1381
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:45,760
so now

1382
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:47,210
i go from here

1383
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:49,260
two here

1384
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:57,090
so here i have my angle of incidence theta one

1385
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:58,880
and here have my angle of ray

1386
01:25:58,890 --> 01:26:02,760
the fraction that is if they they're free

1387
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,460
and now here

1388
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:06,760
i have my

1389
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:09,400
angle theta two

1390
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,500
so if i write down now smells law

1391
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:15,680
and i get the sign of data one

1392
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:18,820
divided by the sine of data two

1393
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:25,530
is now and two divided by n one the n two is one

1394
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:28,030
divided by one point three

1395
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,410
if we go from here

1396
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,720
from water to air

1397
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,490
and what is so special here is that

1398
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:38,780
say that two can obviously never be larger than ninety degrees

1399
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:40,970
so if you substitute in here

1400
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:43,200
there are two ninety degrees

1401
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:45,950
and you will find that they no one then

1402
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:46,840
it's about

1403
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:50,020
fifty degrees

1404
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:52,450
and if you apply this equation

1405
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:56,120
you substitute for one and angle larger than

1406
01:26:56,140 --> 01:27:00,340
fifty degrees you're going to find the sign of data to being larger than one

1407
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,890
which is nonsense

1408
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:03,430
cannot happen

1409
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:05,540
so nature ignores

1410
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:06,840
snails law

1411
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:09,140
and they just story i can do it

1412
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:11,120
and the nature now do does

1413
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:12,150
if the angles

1414
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:17,950
data one is too large in this case there is one larger than fifty degrees

1415
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:24,690
not there anymore and all the light is now being reflected of that surface

1416
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:25,830
and we call that

1417
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:29,180
total reflection

1418
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:38,640
total reflection happens when data one is larger

1419
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:41,160
then a certain critical angle

1420
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:44,750
are the same variable they should always be equal

1421
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:48,490
right that's the same random variable it came from here and it went there and

1422
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,060
also went there

1423
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:52,480
so it should always be equal

1424
01:27:52,490 --> 01:27:55,900
but the message passing algorithm has no way to enforce that there's

1425
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:00,640
there is no consistency being enforced between these two copies i'm sitting here doing my

1426
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:04,420
stuff with my copy of x three e you're sitting there doing your stuff with

1427
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:07,280
your other copy of x three and they're not the same

1428
01:28:07,330 --> 01:28:13,620
so the algorithm which computes something would be something correct but for the wrong model

1429
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,010
so what this sort of says is that you you can be so naive here

1430
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:17,720
i this kind of

1431
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:22,550
very cavalier about i said OK this clustering sort of make it read

1432
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:26,980
so it says we can just be naive but it turns out there's more principled

1433
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:30,260
way to do this that is guaranteed to be correct and that's that's what the

1434
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:34,010
junction tree formalism is

1435
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:36,530
statistical definition

1436
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:40,020
let me just state and then we'll come back and understand the intuition

1437
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:45,480
so just to be clear this thing right here we call this the clique tree

1438
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:50,080
the reason it's likely trees because you started with the original graph and you took

1439
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,120
the cliques

1440
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:52,480
one three

1441
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:53,680
one two

1442
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:57,080
two four and three four you put the separate notes

1443
01:28:57,100 --> 01:29:01,740
so it's a tree on the cliques of the original graph so a clique tree

1444
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:06,600
what we're interested in is clique trees that satisfy

1445
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:10,520
a certain property it's known as the running intersection property

1446
01:29:10,570 --> 01:29:13,330
and what this means is that if you look

1447
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:16,780
at any two clique nodes c one and c two

1448
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:20,060
then because you're in a tree

1449
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:22,920
you know there's is a path you can walk along the path in the tree

1450
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:25,520
from c one to c two

1451
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:30,190
and what we're running intersection says as you walk along that path

1452
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:35,480
anything that's in the intersection of those two should also be on that path

1453
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:43,660
so here for instance

1454
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,240
let me see

1455
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:46,250
actually is

1456
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:51,720
it's not really a non trivial example of it in this graph of one or

1457
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:57,370
that's certainly works for these two you've got to cliques their intersection is too

1458
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:01,610
there's not really anything to say as you walk along the z certainly two is

1459
01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:05,860
what sort of key here is that for node three

1460
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:08,980
but when you intersect discrete with this one

1461
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,550
you get three

1462
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,020
but three does not appear in this clique nor does it appear in that cliques

1463
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,140
this pair

1464
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:19,310
for c one and c two they fail running intersection

1465
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:24,450
so that's the motivation this this kind of lack of communication when you don't have

1466
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:28,950
copies of the random variable talking to each other by the local algorithm then you're

1467
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:33,310
in trouble the new algorithm will not compute the right thing that you're after seeing

1468
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:37,350
need to be quite careful when you make these clique trees and this is the

1469
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:42,470
key property you need to ensure that you always have the intersection along the path

1470
01:30:42,490 --> 01:30:47,740
and it's this intersection property that ensures that i get consistent results i don't get

1471
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:53,950
strange answers that don't really mean anything in terms of the original model

1472
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:55,720
OK so i

1473
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:59,280
what you can show i won't go into details but you can show that if

1474
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,190
you have a clique tree where you have running intersection

1475
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:05,360
so if this property holds

1476
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:09,360
then if you go off and you apply this message passing on such a clique

1477
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:14,580
then you will get the correct answers for your original model

1478
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:18,640
so what sort of saying is that when you form a clique tree

1479
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:22,210
not just any clique tree this is not a good clique tree but one that

1480
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:25,720
has the running intersection property if you can do that

1481
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,270
you have to be careful here

1482
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:31,340
then you can describe the standard message passing on that tree

1483
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:36,050
and you're guaranteed to get the correct answer for your original model

1484
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,650
so this is known as the junction tree when you have a clique tree that

1485
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:42,730
satisfies running intersection a junction tree

1486
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:47,080
you want to think sort of you're looking at the interest actions the junctions between

1487
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:51,640
adjacent cliques so there's notion of taking junctions here

1488
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:55,700
OK so this sort of key question here is what kinds of graphs actually have

1489
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:56,920
junction trees

1490
01:31:56,970 --> 01:32:06,090
for instance does this graph have a junction tree

1491
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:14,690
i remember junction tree is a clique tree that satisfies running intersection

1492
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:18,830
this is a clique tree but we saw that fails running intersection because of node

1493
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:19,900
three appearing twice

1494
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:25,380
but not appearing along this path

1495
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:27,900
but i do something else to the graph i mean to follow up on the

1496
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,440
question that we had back there

1497
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:43,530
would help for instance to eliminate different edge to try and make a junction tree

1498
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,340
if you think about it a bit want

1499
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:57,060
symmetry is the reason that doesn't really matter which would you remove you're always going

1500
01:32:57,060 --> 01:32:58,750
morning to darrell

1501
01:32:59,930 --> 01:33:09,240
world knowledge and rui costa i'm going to talk about active learning so

1502
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:16,020
OK good morning everyone this is

1503
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,270
make sure you have enough

1504
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,620
play in the score

1505
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:22,400
so that we can talk about active learning

1506
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:24,660
and the

1507
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:29,810
tutorial be divided into three parts and it will probably take a couple of breaks

1508
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:31,580
so will do the first part

1509
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:33,410
during the first part of

1510
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:38,120
can have an overview of the idea of active learning some motivation for why it's

1511
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:43,360
interesting in the number of different fields and set some of the

1512
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:50,570
the basic groundwork for the kinds of questions that are interesting to study the focus

1513
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:51,920
here is going to be

1514
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:57,390
of our tutorial overall is going to be mainly on the mathematical theory of active

1515
01:33:57,390 --> 01:33:58,910
learning and

1516
01:33:58,950 --> 01:34:01,860
less emphasis on actual applications

1517
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:05,330
but i will say a little bit about places where it can be applied where

1518
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:09,290
we apply to other people have applied it as we go along

1519
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:11,440
so we'll have about one hour

1520
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:16,030
or a little less of this kind of first part of the introduction then really

1521
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:19,570
we'll talk and he'll be doing a bit of a case study if you will

1522
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:25,240
look very carefully at the problem of active learning in the setting of binary classification

1523
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:29,520
and then we'll have another break after that and then in the final part will

1524
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,740
discuss some other applications of active learning

1525
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:33,900
or or

1526
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:39,230
settings where you can apply active learning also talk about some experiments with humans and

1527
01:34:39,230 --> 01:34:45,240
how humans use active learning techniques and then we'll conclude with some final remarks and

1528
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:51,160
so forth i'd like to ask that all questions be held to the very very

1529
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,750
at the end of right now i'm just kidding of course and we can ask

1530
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:59,340
questions whenever whenever you like you can interact to keep this is informal as possible

1531
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:03,420
and so i encourage you to stop me and

1532
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:06,270
ask for clarifications and so forth OK so

1533
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,900
when we get started

1534
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:12,340
so the idea in active learning is really

1535
01:35:12,390 --> 01:35:18,330
sort about closing the loop in the learning process so rather than a conventional setting

1536
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:22,460
where we just have a whole batch of data somewhere and then we feed that

1537
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:26,630
data into a computer and have the computer grind away on it and try to

1538
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:32,280
learn some sort of classifier or estimate function of the data or something like that

1539
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:37,470
in active learning the idea is really to close the loop so that the

1540
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:42,860
data analysis is actually informing how we do the data collection how we do our

1541
01:35:42,860 --> 01:35:44,240
sensing how we

1542
01:35:44,710 --> 01:35:49,640
the inquiry may questions about the world and so that's that's i think in a

1543
01:35:50,530 --> 01:35:55,100
a good way metaphor to think about this for kind of closing the loop between

1544
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:58,260
data collection and data analysis

1545
01:35:58,270 --> 01:36:00,110
and usually

1546
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:06,050
active learning would actually operate in a sequential fashion where you take some measurements or

1547
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:08,600
observations from the world you

1548
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:09,950
the computer

1549
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:14,670
four person would study those data and then that will guide how they go about

1550
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:19,100
collecting more information in order to try to come up with a good model for

1551
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,780
whatever it is there are study

1552
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:25,460
and this idea is very old and i mean mean

1553
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:29,090
who knows how long you people are doing this but it was kind of formalized

1554
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:36,140
a little bit by little class who according to chains use these kinds of ideas

1555
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:37,110
to help

1556
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:42,140
when he was working with his astronomy colleagues try to decide where they should focus

1557
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:47,450
telescopes in order to discover new things in astronomy and so the idea there was

1558
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:53,770
basically when there was ever large discrepancy between what their predictive models said in what

1559
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:58,080
they are observing that was an interesting place to dwell in focus their scanning of

1560
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:58,810
the sky

1561
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:04,310
and that is something that he credits with some of the discoveries they made

1562
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:08,710
so what is active learning we can just try to describe it in a nutshell

1563
01:37:08,710 --> 01:37:10,470
the idea is usually

1564
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:15,900
we have data that were examples that come to us pairs features and labels and

1565
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:21,820
so x is a feature vector y is say label in binary classification label would

1566
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:25,310
just be zero one or plus one minus one

1567
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:28,470
what we'd like to do

1568
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,540
his select

1569
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:31,250
unlabelled examples

1570
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:37,770
just raw features with no labels and request labels from those particular samples that seem

1571
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:43,740
to be highly uncertain so for an unlabelled example like this will have some predictions

1572
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:44,830
based on

1573
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:49,490
past information that we've gathered so far in that prediction is something we're very confident

1574
01:37:49,490 --> 01:37:53,960
and then you might think well let's not bother requesting label for that example but

1575
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:58,460
if we feel that we don't really have a good sense of where that label

1576
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:02,040
know what you do pretty much all the time and then and then you have

1577
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:05,510
a pretty good declarations and finally how the formulas

1578
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:09,040
so it's actually you know quite simple

1579
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:11,570
to write basic mln

1580
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:14,840
here is the most basic ML the you could write

1581
01:38:14,850 --> 01:38:16,650
it's the empty MLN

1582
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:18,120
no formulas

1583
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:23,180
and in tamil and actually represents something meaningful represents a uniform distribution

1584
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:28,020
what is an empty MLN representing from distribution well let's look at the example of

1585
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:29,670
flipping coins

1586
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:31,850
let's assume that there are unbiased

1587
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:35,490
it is that the most the simplest thing you could possibly want to model how

1588
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,010
you do this in aachen

1589
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:41,560
well you declare type called flip that ranges from one to an infinite number of

1590
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:43,120
flips you want to have

1591
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:47,130
and then you can request single predicate heads of flu which is truth if it

1592
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:50,210
comes up and if the coin comes up heads and false otherwise

1593
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:55,470
now what is the probability that you get hands on any given flip

1594
01:38:56,280 --> 01:39:00,060
so now i notice i have no no formulas right so the argument that the

1595
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:02,590
exponential is always going to be zero

1596
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:04,340
right no matter what happens

1597
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:08,060
so the probability of heads is the property of is the is the is the

1598
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:11,530
value of you know of the MLN distribution for heads

1599
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:14,890
over the valley for the alpha tails but they both the same

1600
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:16,900
they both e to the zero

1601
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:20,620
times the partition function so the result is that

1602
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:24,990
OK so the empty MLN represents a from distribution well

1603
01:39:25,010 --> 01:39:30,070
let's go one step beyond and see how well we represent the binomial distribution it's

1604
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:32,150
the next simplest thing about one

1605
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:35,620
let's suppose the euro coin flips biased

1606
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:40,670
right so calling has more probability say turning up heads and tails

1607
01:39:40,690 --> 01:39:43,710
this can be represented using an and with a single

1608
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:48,090
unit clause unit clauses clause containing only one literal

1609
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:52,430
so here's here's a that typical relation an outbreak cooperation and i have a single

1610
01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:55,770
formula heads of f

1611
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:58,920
this formula saying it's going to come up heads

1612
01:39:58,970 --> 01:40:00,770
the weight to this formula

1613
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:03,910
is going to be just the log odds of getting it's this is a very

1614
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:07,620
well known thing in statistics log odds of an event it's the log of the

1615
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:09,040
probability of heads

1616
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:12,210
over the probability of tails which is one minus the probability of heads

1617
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:16,080
why why does this work out well let's see

1618
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:18,150
the problem that you get heads

1619
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:22,650
one of the times e to the w right because if it comes up heads

1620
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:25,450
for history and you get the weight w

1621
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:29,720
over the probability that it's true class this if it's false

1622
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:33,360
right if it's false and the features are true receive get zero

1623
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:37,600
so what you get is it to the ovary to the plus one

1624
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,480
which is the same as one of one plus e to the minus the bear

1625
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:45,890
and it's easy you know this is equal to the probability of heads

1626
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:48,630
and it's easy to see you know you can do the elder and see that

1627
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:50,610
these two expressions are called

1628
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:55,280
so you can represent the binomial distribution by having a single class

1629
01:40:55,290 --> 01:40:56,400
where the weight

1630
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:59,690
is the log odds corresponding to the success probability

1631
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:05,870
and unit clauses are so useful that by default

1632
01:41:05,910 --> 01:41:11,110
when you learn in ML and the unit clauses for all predicates are included

1633
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:14,830
among other things the unit clauses allow you to capture the marginal distributions of the

1634
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:19,520
and the other clauses can focus on on modeling interactions between them which is what

1635
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:20,420
we want to have

1636
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,120
the question

1637
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:28,350
means is that think that

1638
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:32,670
so if you have another formerly called not heads of that if it had the

1639
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,210
same weight

1640
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:36,050
the two weeks with cancer

1641
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:39,610
if you have a different way than what you get is the distribution instead of

1642
01:41:39,610 --> 01:41:42,280
the here have the difference of

1643
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:49,610
next the most complex thing let's represent a multinomial distribution for example let's say we're

1644
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:51,110
throwing die

1645
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:52,670
OK how would we do that

1646
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:55,160
well i could have two types throw

1647
01:41:55,170 --> 01:41:57,770
again from one to twelve we want to happen face

1648
01:41:57,770 --> 01:42:01,100
which in the case of the dionysian enough so we have one to six

1649
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:04,210
and we can have the predicate outcomethrow face

1650
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:08,340
that says you know on the and throw the face came up

1651
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:12,340
and now what formulas do we need to represent this

1652
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,580
well now we know what we need to represent the fact that the outcomes are

1653
01:42:15,590 --> 01:42:20,300
mutually exclusive and exhaustive like the that can only land on one face

1654
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:24,950
so how do we represent what we can write are logic we can say

1655
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:27,300
if the outcome of t is f

1656
01:42:27,310 --> 01:42:31,190
and f is different from the phi then the outcome of t is not a

1657
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,770
OK this exclamation mark means negation

1658
01:42:35,050 --> 01:42:38,230
this is the you can have two outcomes at the same time

1659
01:42:38,350 --> 01:42:42,240
there exists as such that outcome of t is that says that

1660
01:42:42,270 --> 01:42:44,370
you know there's always one

1661
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:48,120
and these full stops here mean that these formulas are hard

1662
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:49,850
i deterministic

1663
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:52,140
they have infinite weight

1664
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:56,120
so full stop is a shorthand for infinite weight these always have to hold

1665
01:42:56,380 --> 01:43:02,020
so you could represent the multinomial distribution by having this formula

1666
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:04,080
however this is very cumbersome

1667
01:43:04,830 --> 01:43:08,410
when we go about you know their applications are interested in we're going have multinomial

1668
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:12,180
distributions all over the place and would be very boring to have to write these

1669
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:16,320
two formulas for every single my you know predicate that we have

1670
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:20,900
luckily there is a nice piece of notation

1671
01:43:20,910 --> 01:43:23,990
that will make things much more succinct

1672
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:27,330
and that is the exclamation mark notation

1673
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:32,120
is just this when you click the predicate you put an exclamation mark in front

1674
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:34,810
of the value that is supposed to be unique

1675
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:40,300
so what outcome of through face means that for every value throw there is exactly

1676
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:44,320
one value face for which outcomethrow face is true

1677
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:47,580
and the general semantics of this of course is that

1678
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:49,840
his multiplicities and without multiplicities

1679
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:52,680
then we calculate the integral

1680
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:53,830
we conclude

1681
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:55,970
the number of zeros multiplicities

1682
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:59,360
but when the columns and on changes science

1683
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:01,500
because the heroes

1684
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:02,940
without multiplicities

1685
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:07,490
so it is zero accounted only for one zero

1686
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:09,900
w zero

1687
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:11,600
will never be detected

1688
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:15,450
because on both sides of the plants have the same sign

1689
01:44:18,450 --> 01:44:18,750
and so

1690
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:22,880
just like that

1691
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:25,160
although there are also five a simple

1692
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:29,020
in the first part of his newspaper

1693
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:31,990
during describes this technique

1694
01:44:34,220 --> 01:44:36,500
but what new was done by humans

1695
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:40,240
he introduced a new methods quickly enough to

1696
01:44:41,470 --> 01:44:42,350
very different from

1697
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:43,550
what i

1698
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,180
i mentioned before

1699
01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:48,880
and then he adds

1700
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:54,850
the paper is divided into

1701
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:55,800
two parts

1702
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:57,920
the first part is devoted to

1703
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,110
then is connected with problem

1704
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:03,430
all the results obtained in this part

1705
01:45:04,110 --> 01:45:04,890
a little bit

1706
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:08,260
the initial initially calculations for the same amount

1707
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,910
but the carried out on the manchester

1708
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:12,280
computer all by

1709
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:14,190
other means

1710
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:17,110
and that is really true

1711
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:19,930
and to link message is used up to now

1712
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:23,930
and now i will try to reduce the outline what was the

1713
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:26,600
but the idea of student

1714
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:32,280
if we believe in ground floor

1715
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:36,680
then the number of zeros would be approximately

1716
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:37,680
equal to the

1717
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:40,010
number grumblings before

1718
01:45:41,290 --> 01:45:41,980
given limited

1719
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:44,680
and this number is easy to calculate

1720
01:45:45,610 --> 01:45:48,380
fasten it is monotone so we can rewrite it this way

1721
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:52,130
by definition ground point this is just by multiplying by

1722
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:54,870
so this is equivalent to such inequality

1723
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:58,310
so the nomogram points approximate this is ritual

1724
01:45:59,490 --> 01:46:00,630
and we can write that

1725
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:02,660
the number of points inside

1726
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:04,090
the rectangular area

1727
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:05,520
is this the main

1728
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:10,050
plus along because it started militant inputs from minus one

1729
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:13,690
plus some function which you might expect to be small

1730
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:16,970
and in fact

1731
01:46:17,910 --> 01:46:20,080
levels proof that this small on average

1732
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:24,200
and student and this is based on these

1733
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:25,600
serum of little

1734
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:29,300
but little himself

1735
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:30,650
did not so

1736
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:33,240
results can be used

1737
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:35,220
for checking the hypothesis

1738
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:39,450
now has its own attitudes who made for the calculations

1739
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:41,480
and don't do it

1740
01:46:42,690 --> 01:46:43,270
found very

1741
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:44,300
to use

1742
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:45,840
this system of little

1743
01:46:47,570 --> 01:46:48,610
accelerates chicken

1744
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:50,520
that among reporters

1745
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:54,200
by itself

1746
01:46:55,780 --> 01:46:58,080
little theorem is useless for computation

1747
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:01,820
because it doesn't tell us anything about any particular

1748
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:05,010
because of this

1749
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:07,720
capital o notation

1750
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:12,420
the first thing done by student was the following

1751
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:16,390
captain quantitative improvement of little theorem

1752
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,260
he found exact balance before

1753
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,090
the average below this function as

1754
01:47:22,990 --> 01:47:23,750
and given interval

1755
01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:28,980
and here is

1756
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:30,490
part of

1757
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:32,060
his paper

1758
01:47:33,290 --> 01:47:34,340
here is a statement of

1759
01:47:34,950 --> 01:47:35,480
the serum

1760
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:36,550
and then

1761
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:37,660
there follows

1762
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:38,850
five pages

1763
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:41,370
of a typical numbers typical kind

1764
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,220
is an accurate estimation of different some something the growth

1765
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,250
so what was

1766
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:54,810
they deal student

1767
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:06,890
you want to know

1768
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:10,490
if there also below some people lie on the critical line

1769
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:19,220
for this then we would need to calculate a after

1770
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:20,990
but we could say that

1771
01:48:21,350 --> 01:48:23,990
different value of do agreed abandon ship

1772
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:26,620
the same with a great ability

1773
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:28,930
and that this

1774
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:35,220
my turned out to be more convenient for calculation of this function as of today

1775
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:41,120
and technology changes order things

1776
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:42,700
he said

1777
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:44,970
let us try to find some to zero

1778
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:47,100
which is it is indeed

1779
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:53,570
say that you want the value of as being equal to zero

1780
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:57,620
so instead of starting from you and go into the

1781
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:00,780
if you predicted the value of has

1782
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:03,390
and london just defined such that is zero

1783
01:49:05,930 --> 01:49:07,240
battle for such a team

1784
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:10,760
if it is zero

1785
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:12,350
then this history

1786
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:14,890
this is integer so this is an integer

1787
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:16,140
this means that

1788
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:18,160
numerator is

1789
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:19,970
a multiple of pi

1790
01:49:20,570 --> 01:49:22,550
so the front and sides with equal to zero

1791
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:25,050
this implies that these are all should be our

1792
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:26,890
gram point

1793
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:32,340
okay so we look for such a two zero among gram points

1794
01:49:33,950 --> 01:49:35,320
and now we can do this all

1795
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:37,160
and that it was more than

1796
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:39,620
the ground points

1797
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:40,910
two days
