1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
there seem to be

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,540
some topics

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,890
on which there are no nodes

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,510
in normal years this

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,290
the course is to it

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,340
this year contracted to six

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,450
and we seem to have been over-enthusiastic chopping bits out in hopes

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,810
such talk about some things

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,840
least on which you don't have but

10
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,890
you'll survive

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:40,030
it says in here that the next thing i talk about the natural deduction that's

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,370
not true

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,270
and i'm lecturer so i get to say whether it's true or not

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:53,520
i shall see whether i

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,670
i get to talk about natural deduction tomorrow morning

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,520
the some advantage to talking about set theory instead

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,160
there's is a lecture that sometimes died summer school called the joy of sets

18
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,950
contains everything you need to know about set theory in fifteen minutes

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,390
that's quite good fun is better than plodding through natural deduction rules

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,810
and i do that

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,240
and the next

22
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,480
i'm going to do

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,460
quick overview quick introduction

24
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,460
proof theory

25
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,990
this is it

26
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,530
among the things that are not in the numbers

27
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:58,520
that's quite an important

28
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,700
way of presenting logic and will be relevant to things that happen in the rest

29
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,800
of the summer school so

30
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,130
i need to go through it

31
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,060
albeit briefly

32
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,370
we have

33
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,960
so far this morning

34
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,280
we have two ways

35
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,600
set of

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,740
intuitively valid derivable

37
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,010
first order logic we haven't characterized semantically

38
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,750
in terms of satisfaction truth and

39
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,500
the notation and all those things

40
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,780
and we haven't characterized deductively in terms of derivations

41
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,790
you in an expert system

42
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,390
there is another

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,640
important way

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,100
of capturing

45
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,400
desired set of sequence

46
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,330
and that is to axiomatized

47
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,840
the correct sequence directly

48
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,180
rather than going through

49
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,120
and a story about

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,250
about about derivations

51
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,100
so we can lay down as axioms that certain sequence

52
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,810
accepted approval of allah

53
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,900
and then give some rules for transforming those trivially

54
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,900
sequence into non trivially valid ones

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,620
does axiomatized in the set of

56
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,560
prec sequence

57
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,390
and what's called the sequent calculus

58
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,070
this as an excellent properties

59
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,910
they are not shared by the hilbert

60
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,210
fraga systems

61
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,670
and we need to look at them briefly

62
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,960
let me start those somewhere else

63
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,160
you probably know

64
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,050
done some

65
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,030
elementary logic

66
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,960
that there is a certain amount of work around

67
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,510
on representing

68
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,390
formulae in certain normal forms

69
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,260
there is

70
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,040
for example while for example we had a normal form in a sense

71
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,500
this morning in the deductive system in which i presented them all in terms of

72
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,330
implication and negation and said well everything else gets to find the way

73
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,280
the point being that for anything else that's outside the vocabulary there is an equivalent

74
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,190
in the capital was

75
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,350
the one we going to do

76
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,560
stepmother other normal forms

77
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,980
perhaps more important on more more widely used these days

78
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,220
one of those is

79
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,590
is the negation normal form

80
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,650
usually written NNF

81
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,980
in which

82
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:18,080
we use is binary connectives just conjunction and disjunction

83
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,810
this can be nested inside each other as we wish

84
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,640
we have

85
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,690
formula of the form and a where

86
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,510
sorry and not a where a is atomic

87
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,610
and of course atoms

88
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,670
lawyers said to the judge

89
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,830
o now first show

90
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,780
that my client never borrowed

91
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,150
the main base from the plaintiff

92
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,370
second he he returned the vase in perfect condition and third that the crack was

93
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,440
already there

94
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,020
when he retired

95
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,150
so this sort of thing is is the feeling you can get when you go

96
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,390
through group theory course it's quite well because it wasn't there now because it's the

97
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,110
it's not so

98
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,220
there with me we're going through lots of different nations and i will show a

99
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,880
little bit of a so when i get call that you are a bit confusing

100
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,780
you probably see of asia again

101
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,970
so intuitively this idea of course as i said

102
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,010
it's essentially a generalisation of power

103
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,970
you have your group you have a group you have sub-groups

104
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,030
anyone copies of these groups

105
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,510
why i want copies of this group probably because this subgroup you chose

106
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,640
has some nice properties

107
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,700
you want all

108
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,960
all of them

109
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,500
that have that property

110
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,580
so you start collecting parallel violence

111
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,860
this is quite lively

112
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,770
in this case i showed before

113
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,160
this was

114
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,120
this was very easy for us

115
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,700
only the translation of the cleavage

116
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,440
eclipse space

117
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,900
but groups can get can be quite is on the first of all

118
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,690
groups can be finite and continue

119
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,630
and we went through the going to touch a little bit and both of them

120
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,150
here in this

121
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,140
how do you construct a general course

122
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:28,020
here the definition of group which is natural

123
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,490
it's just any subset with the same operation

124
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,100
that's two former group

125
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,560
and you just

126
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,290
two to construct an cos it's just a

127
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,210
this supergroup shows

128
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,480
and multiply this subgroup by

129
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,610
an element

130
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,490
in general elements in the group

131
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,730
so you collect then you want

132
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,820
is your subgroups

133
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,170
which is one element

134
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,700
in that case there

135
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,980
should before was the constant c one

136
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,040
to generate a course that the multiply that by the group

137
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,970
and collect all new elements

138
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,500
this is caused this is one of course that

139
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,260
left course it's because i want to play here by the left which makes difference

140
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,710
in group multiplication if they are not the values

141
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,710
a billion groups is another set in groups has a lot of the same name

142
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,460
middle names and

143
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,460
and family names so

144
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,830
this battalion is when the water

145
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,140
of multiplication of then doesn't matter

146
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,480
which happens with being taken with the

147
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,410
number with been taken with the multiplication

148
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,490
if you take into use

149
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,110
model number

150
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,230
these forms are group

151
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,190
and it's some value doesn't matter where you multiply fits left to right

152
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:02,740
but essentially we will be dealing with left cosets you all the time

153
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,810
so here the this this sentence has to be clear

154
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,700
it's one

155
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,740
of the cosets of h

156
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,910
in old

157
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,570
h using

158
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,930
using g

159
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,390
and this is in this this element choose

160
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,100
so here's an example from the natural

161
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,150
you have the group there which is just the set zero one two three

162
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,000
it's is called c four

163
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,710
the subgroup

164
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,970
it's zero

165
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,050
you see that

166
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,050
zero has to be there because it is the identity in this case

167
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,370
and to construct the cosets

168
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,100
you multiply

169
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,400
you know age by all elements

170
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,560
of the degree

171
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,820
so you get all this

172
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,640
is always the course

173
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,760
it's always

174
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,790
in general is the only one

175
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,240
that forms are group

176
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,600
the first non trivial here

177
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,080
this here is

178
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,110
trivial again

179
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,040
and is this

180
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,640
other one

181
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,170
so this is subgroup h has

182
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,510
two concepts

183
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,000
eight itself and one three

184
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,630
and you can note that

185
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,670
if you

186
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,120
z can be decomposed into union of this two

187
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,470
the this one here and this one

188
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,440
so this is always the case

189
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,480
here we show this for

190
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,470
g from naturals

191
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,500
but it's always the case

192
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,310
so another surname forward

193
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,880
so group can be enormous

194
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,720
normal subgroup

195
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,170
and normal subgroup follows this property here

196
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,280
you take one element of

197
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,280
and now it's so group

198
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,330
replacing the age

199
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,220
and if you act

200
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,600
g is general element of g

201
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,170
and h is an element of the

202
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,040
of the subgroup

203
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,920
it is something i did i it because it should be

204
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,640
represent an element from and i changed left

205
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,130
so really this of the man

206
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,640
and what happens here is that if you multiply an element of this subgroup

207
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,220
my general elements of the

208
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,540
and multiply the other side by the inverse

209
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,770
is still

210
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,110
you don't move out from this of course is doing in this

211
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,810
this is called the normal subgroup

212
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,710
it's it's important information

213
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,510
but for us here it's not is not that important but it's a very important

214
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,060
thing in group theory

215
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,740
in four here what we

216
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,150
we want this will need here is that

217
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,830
if this subgroup is normal

218
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,740
then all cosets form a group

219
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,410
this is one example

220
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,720
all of this

221
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,530
can you

222
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,760
you probably cannot read that can see that

223
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,360
so in this sense

224
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,420
these are is a generalisation of the division

225
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,930
so you have that is the vision of twelve but for everybody knows this three

226
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,230
you can take a zero

227
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,810
this is this is from natural right

228
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,950
the operation d one here

229
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,000
it's when you some

230
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,500
you know you get

231
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,360
all the elements in the other

232
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,390
and you have some again you get all of them

233
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,630
we have this to this three

234
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,220
core sets

235
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,110
and these three cosets form a group

236
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,070
now i know

237
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,740
the final phase

238
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,240
and i use the small angle approximation which is more than adequate

239
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,990
i know no where on the screen i get

240
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,280
again maximum

241
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,950
that is when you one point two centimetres on this side and one or two

242
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,470
centimeters on the other side you get of course was

243
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,880
as well as my

244
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,000
and then i can continue for n equals one then equal to

245
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,850
i'll just do it wasn't minus

246
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,830
so then you get

247
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,870
minus twenty five

248
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,680
then you get twenty four

249
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,410
times ten to the minus three so you get minus twelve

250
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,920
almost linear because the sign of data

251
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,420
for the small angles

252
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,520
it is still the same as they

253
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,390
in regions

254
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,260
before i show the demonstration

255
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,590
i want a little bit more information on the

256
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,090
on the shape

257
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:20,630
of the dark and light areas that i'm going to see

258
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,990
well plot here now

259
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,430
it is

260
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,580
i love this bar is later

261
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,580
i want to work above my head

262
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,180
so you can see what i'm doing

263
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,790
so plotting year

264
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,050
the sign of data

265
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,880
you might that is linearly proportional was ax always prefer

266
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,350
what the signs data

267
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,640
so here is

268
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,130
here the have divided by is where my first maximum will come you can see

269
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,530
and then here

270
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,150
the same distance

271
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,930
i glad to land that divided by p

272
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,430
and on the on the other side i have

273
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,670
minus led and all of these are maximum

274
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,840
constructive interference

275
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,820
and the destructive interference clearly falls

276
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,630
back in the middle

277
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,110
i did not have calculate

278
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,330
so the destructive interference here

279
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,800
so you get

280
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,420
like curves light intensity

281
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,840
it's like this

282
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,290
light intensity remember is always

283
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,930
poynting vector

284
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,340
this is light intensity

285
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:50,300
and that is in what was for me

286
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,580
the first thing

287
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,570
i want you to notice

288
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,590
and you will see that today in various demonstrations

289
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,190
is that the location of the maxima

290
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,670
depends on the wavelength

291
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,470
that means if red light

292
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,650
six hundred fifty

293
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,490
not only

294
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,400
that falls years max

295
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,470
and it falls he was the maximum

296
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,330
and it has a maximum

297
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,190
and as their next that blue light

298
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,140
which would have a wavelength say i think four hundred nanometers

299
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,610
will not

300
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,320
i have a maximum at the same location therefore not mean i e

301
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,800
because look at the

302
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,470
the song is and finds lab

303
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,410
so the angles of things different

304
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,780
and so you would get you roughly about

305
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,750
no way

306
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,090
year after the maximum

307
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,170
but you get the maximum

308
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,430
notice that for n equals zero

309
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,090
the red and the blue and the maximum at the same location

310
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,680
but you would get the first

311
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,950
the rule

312
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,540
get the second maxima

313
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:10,040
you get the maximum almost exactly at the location where you got the second maximum

314
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,410
for red

315
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,370
the reason being the prime

316
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,930
six hundred and fifty

317
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,270
is very close to three

318
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,490
four hundred

319
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:23,450
that's the reason so need to live a life of its own

320
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,970
the light intensity that you see

321
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,740
is the call sign

322
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,420
square function of delta divided by two this is so fundamental that

323
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,760
first i thought i'll ask you to derive

324
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,400
then i decided to spend one minute on it

325
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,370
and the right for you because it's extremely important

326
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,760
that you will use it later in our

327
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,880
so let's assume that source number one

328
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,330
and the other michael source number two

329
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,140
but the source number one

330
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,470
these are one thousand e

331
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,350
you want or not zero irrelevant one

332
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,240
as an individual zero when it reaches the screen

333
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,400
and then of course you of cosine omega t

334
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,280
this is the frequency of the light

335
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,210
electromagnetic radiation

336
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,620
e what is the other source

337
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,800
as easier to

338
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,930
nine cosine omega t

339
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,170
u is the crucial delta which is the difference between the two

340
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,790
interface that's why you get maximum and that's why the minimum

341
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,180
that's the whole idea of interference

342
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,250
now if you very far away from the two openings

343
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,450
then these vectors are of course very close to the same remember is proportional to

344
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,690
to one of our

345
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,840
but if the distance are is very close to the same

346
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,510
then we can assume good approximation

347
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,430
that the

348
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,810
with the expected value of the states that at one time step away

349
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,580
and the policy pi

350
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,490
so for all states s

351
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,490
you need the value of state s is the immediate reward plus

352
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,180
the discount gamma is missing this of expected

353
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,740
value the next day and the policy pi

354
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,010
this is set this system of equations

355
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,640
one for every state

356
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,640
who solution

357
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,470
value for policy pi

358
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,740
like this this system of equations one for every state

359
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,790
or the unknown to the system of equations

360
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,830
the value function

361
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,080
what's known what defined by a markov decision process as a reward function and the

362
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,490
transition probabilities

363
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,720
there and states that n equations in n unknowns and you can solve this if

364
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,790
you like before the

365
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:40,330
value for the value function policy pi

366
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,600
it turns out to be very useful to also define alternative definition for

367
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,310
the value function which was called q values

368
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:53,930
or state action values which defines a number not for states has here

369
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,220
but for state action pairs let me i come in handy we we talk about

370
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:03,120
sort of the the most famous contribution reinforcement is q

371
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:08,080
so here's the definition of the state action value for policy pi

372
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,060
it's just the expected value

373
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,120
of the discounted sum of rewards if you start in state s

374
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,990
the first action UK

375
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,160
is a

376
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,010
and thereafter you follow policy pi

377
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:25,810
so delays policy pi one step and prescribed action a in the starting state and

378
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:31,510
ask how good is that starting state action pair rather than the starting state into

379
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,240
what we define here

380
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,520
and you can similarly define it ecosystem of equations

381
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,430
q value for state action pairs immediately what you get if you take action a

382
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,560
in state s now

383
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,970
the action as

384
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,020
plus the discounted

385
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,560
missing again expected

386
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,390
value for the next state but you have to be able to policy pi the

387
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,390
next year or

388
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,270
can you have a system of equations now

389
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,330
was solution is these

390
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,470
quantities of interest which is the value

391
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:09,410
of these actions but it is unclear why these values are interesting become too limited

392
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:15,060
ability anticipate that is to say the value function the interesting because this summarise

393
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,620
the long-term consequences of this policy

394
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,790
by the pyre this is a summary statistic numbers

395
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,810
that says

396
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,120
what's the long-term utility of being in state s

397
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,410
if you're in state s

398
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,720
what's the long-term benefit you get

399
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,270
he be called upon so it captures this together

400
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:40,870
right all of future it is one of

401
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,660
we define a similar system of equations for the optimal control problem and then i

402
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,410
think we only talk about algorithms and about to get you out of your feeling

403
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,660
that giving it too many definitions let me go to one more by definition of

404
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,990
the algorithms

405
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,140
OK so the optimal can here is the optimal control problems

406
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,040
that equation so that control problem is defined as learn

407
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,240
compute the optimal policy of the optimal value function so here's the

408
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,200
because the system of equations that i found that is said of that

409
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,490
the solution is the optimal value function

410
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,640
from state s

411
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
the best you can do

412
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,660
from states from state s

413
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,120
is you consider all possible actions in that state

414
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,870
and for each action you ask what is the immediate reward i get to that

415
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:35,450
this can get this kind of missing in this county expected the best i could

416
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,770
do for the next day

417
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,390
that's the best i can do in the state is i consider every possible action

418
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,060
this day

419
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,220
three jackson ask what's the immediate reward i get

420
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,750
but what's the best i can do it expectation from the next state get ready

421
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,400
been at point

422
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,090
nine point zero

423
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,740
kilometres per second

424
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,790
and and i'll give you five zero

425
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,280
six hundred twenty degrees

426
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,230
everything else we should be able to calculate now from these numbers

427
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,110
first of all

428
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,650
which equation five

429
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:11,760
you can convince yourself sticking in these numbers that the total energy is in the

430
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,110
because if i make the total energy positive is not an ellipse

431
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,490
is all of

432
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,110
is negative is an ellipse

433
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,100
so was the creation number five

434
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,520
i then pop out a

435
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,450
right because this one equation with one another

436
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,900
and i put in the numbers

437
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:29,840
you can

438
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,660
confirm them and check them at home

439
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,370
and i find that is quite large

440
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,670
he is about

441
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,000
fifty thousand

442
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,470
that's huge

443
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,780
that is almost

444
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,870
infinity not quite

445
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,950
remember it starts off at nine thousand kilometres

446
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:54,350
eight fifty thousand kilometres leads to a hundred thousand kilometers

447
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,460
why is that so large

448
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,240
well the answer lies in

449
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,000
evaluating the escape velocity

450
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,410
escape velocity

451
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,510
all of this

452
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,620
the last when it is at position

453
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,890
which these ideas input parameters

454
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,980
is the square root

455
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,600
of two mg

456
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,740
divided by are zero

457
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,710
and that's nine point four

458
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,450
kilometres per second

459
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,650
if you need nine point four kilometres per second to make it out to infinity

460
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,550
and you have nine kilometres per second pretty close already

461
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:39,130
so that's the reason why this so a major axis is indeed such horrendous number

462
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,050
no surprise

463
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,300
if no i use equation number six

464
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,790
i find

465
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,750
and i find that it takes about thirty one hours

466
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,980
but is object to go around

467
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,410
the earth

468
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,670
so far so good now we want to know

469
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,570
what the situation is

470
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,670
and with

471
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,790
can we calculate the distance

472
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,500
can we calculate the speed

473
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,950
at location p

474
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,060
and at location a

475
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,480
columns are superior knowledge

476
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:18,290
now we're going to apply for the first time systems like this conservation

477
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,530
angular momentum

478
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,820
angular momentum is conserved

479
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,590
about this point q

480
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,970
but only about the point q

481
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,320
it's not conserved about any other point that's OK

482
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,270
all i want is that point q

483
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,400
that is where

484
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,580
capital and is located

485
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,090
one is the magnitude

486
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,380
one of the angular momentum

487
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,830
well that first

488
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,800
o point d

489
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,910
when the object is at the

490
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,610
the magnitude of the angular momentum is an

491
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,800
the zero

492
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,070
times are zero

493
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,290
i'm signed

494
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,840
o five zero

495
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,370
this is the situation

496
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,600
why do we have assigned by zero because we have a cross between r and

497
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,300
and was across product you have signed rank

498
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,800
that's the situation point

499
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,330
what is the situation

500
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,440
at point p

501
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,860
that point b

502
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,590
the velocity vector is perpendicular

503
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,120
two the line q

504
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,080
so decided angle is one

505
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,210
so now i simply get an

506
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,920
times the of

507
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,300
time the distance

508
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,360
you can do the same

509
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,570
four point eight

510
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,700
you can write down

511
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,520
and i'm of a kind of QA

512
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:41,020
i'm not doing that you will see shortly why i'm not doing

513
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,640
nature is very kind just going to give me that last part for free

514
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,250
this by the way

515
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,630
is the conservation

516
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,520
about that point q where the

517
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,250
last is located

518
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,250
i have you one equation with two unknowns the of

519
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,150
and QP

520
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,630
so i cancelled

521
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,980
so any the equation well of course

522
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,230
there is another one

523
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,430
we have also the conservation of mechanical energy

524
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,510
so now

525
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,210
we can say that the total energy

526
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,480
must be conserved

527
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,550
and the total energy

528
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,730
is one half i do it at point b

529
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,970
equals one half

530
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,600
the square

531
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,030
that is the kinetic energy

532
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,590
and ng

533
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,500
divided by the distance

534
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,360
this is the potential energy

535
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:46,440
the distance between capital and and the land is QP

536
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,830
but this number we know

537
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:51,340
because that is minus divided by two

538
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,180
that's our equation

539
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,330
number five

540
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,710
i slipped up here

541
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,270
you may have noticed it

542
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,230
i dropped a little and

543
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,460
it should be in here

544
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:09,540
sorry for that

545
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,050
so now we have here

546
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,290
big moment in our lives that we have applied both laws

547
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,250
this is the conservation

548
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,560
and now i have two equations with two unknowns

549
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,060
and of p

550
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,200
so i can solve for both

551
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,480
notice that this second equation

552
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,370
is a quadratic equation in view of p

553
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,120
so you're going to get two solutions

554
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,780
and the two solutions

555
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,050
i will give you the distance QP

556
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,210
the other one will be a

557
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,630
which if you the

558
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,150
distance qn

559
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,770
how come that we get both solutions

560
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,960
the whole

561
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,450
this is only stupid equation

562
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,890
this equation

563
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,660
doesn't i use the subscript p

564
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,870
i could have used this subscript here and fourteen your QA

565
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,330
the term that i left out

566
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,430
therefore when i saw

567
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,350
equations i

568
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,600
get both VP

569
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,480
because those that situations that the velocity vector is perpendicular

570
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,440
to the

571
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,670
position vector

572
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,340
and if i use now

573
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,880
our numerical

574
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,770
and i sold for you that quadratic equation two equations is

575
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,020
two unknowns

576
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,450
but i find that

577
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,400
you may want to

578
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,550
check that

579
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,780
it's about six point six

580
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,580
times ten to the thirty three kilometres

581
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,560
it means that only two hundred kilometres above the earth's surface

582
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:57,470
that low altitude this orbit will not last very long and the satellite will re-enter

583
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,040
into the earth's atmosphere

584
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:04,320
and it leads to a speed at point p parity

585
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,730
of seven to ten point seven

586
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,750
kilometres per second

587
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,750
my second solution then

588
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,230
is that q

589
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,690
it turns out to be

590
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:20,860
no surprise because we notice so my major axis is fifty thousand kilometres

591
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,080
we find nine point three

592
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,770
times ten to the four

593
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,960
and we find for the of a this value is fourteen times larger than this

594
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,580
and so the velocity will be fourteen times smaller

595
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,190
i think it's o point seven five

596
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:41,140
dreams slips of the tongue and so on

597
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,680
the first idea the idea of unconscious motivations

598
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,940
on the other

599
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,530
involves rejecting the claim but you know what you're doing

600
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:53,030
so suppose you fall in love with somebody

601
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,390
and you decide you want to marry them

602
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,090
and then somebody was asked to ask you wanted

603
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,030
and you say something like well

604
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,380
i'm ready to get married to stage in my life i really love the person

605
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,950
to person is smart and attractive i want to have kids whatever

606
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,150
and maybe

607
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,910
this is true

608
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,820
but freudian might say

609
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,430
but even if this is your honest answer

610
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,830
you're not line

611
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,170
anybody else

612
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:26,030
their desires and motivations that governor behavior but you may not be aware of

613
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,920
so in fact you might want to marry john

614
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,860
because you remind you of your father

615
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,970
because you want to get back at somebody for betraying you

616
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,740
if somebody wants to help you this

617
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,230
you say that total nonsense

618
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:46,910
but that would deter fraud in fourteen would say that these processes are unconscious

619
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:51,840
so what you just don't know what's happening so the radical idea here is

620
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,520
you might not know

621
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,110
what i want you to do

622
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,010
what you do

623
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,580
and this is something we except for things like visual perception

624
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,420
we accept that you look around the world and you get sensations in you figure

625
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:11,350
there's there's tree person and you just unconscious about this happens but it's unpleasant and

626
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,500
kind of frightening that this could happen that this could

627
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:19,130
apply to things like why are now studying at you

628
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,570
why you feel the way you do

629
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,450
torture friends torture family

630
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,670
the marriage cases extreme

631
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:33,020
but freud gives a lot of simpler examples where this sort of unconscious motivation might

632
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,070
play a role

633
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,560
so have you ever like somebody or dislike and not not know why

634
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,590
have you ever found yourself in a situation where you're doing something or you're arguing

635
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:48,730
for something or making a decision for reasons that you can fully articulated

636
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,830
have you ever forgotten somebody's name at exactly the wrong time

637
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,910
have you ever call the running in the throes of passion

638
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,460
this is all

639
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:02,590
the freudian unconscious the idea is that we do these things these things are explained

640
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,700
in terms of of cognitive systems that we're not aware of

641
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,630
now all of this would be fine

642
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,790
if you are unconscious was a reasonable rational computer if you unconscious was really smart

643
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,030
and looking out for your best interest

644
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,420
but according to freud that's not the way it works according to freud there are

645
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:27,990
three distinct processes going on in your head and these are in violent internal conflict

646
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,420
and the way you have to know where you think our products not of the

647
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:37,010
rational beings but set of conflicting creatures

648
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,670
and these three parts

649
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,080
are there it

650
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,520
he goes

651
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,530
and the super eagles

652
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,830
and they merge developmentally

653
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,040
the according to freud is present at birth

654
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,340
it's the animal part of the self

655
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,770
it wants to eat drink people

656
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,670
get warmer

657
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,970
and have sexual satisfaction it is outrageously stupid

658
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,970
it works and what freud called the pleasure principle

659
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,890
it wants pleasure and it once it now

660
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,070
and that's according to freud how human begins

661
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,470
freud had this wonderful phrase polymorphisms perversity

662
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,040
this pure desire for pleasure

663
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,990
now unfortunately life doesn't work like that what you want is and always what you

664
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:31,140
and this leads to a set of reactions to call with the fact that pleasure

665
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,840
is and always there when you want either

666
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,980
why planning how to satisfy desires

667
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,110
planning how to suppress the

668
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,680
in this system is known as the eagle or the cells

669
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,680
and it works on

670
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,790
the reality principle

671
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:53,100
and it it it works on the principle trying to figure out how to make

672
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,630
your way through the world had to satisfy your letters or in some cases had

673
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,410
to give up on

674
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,980
and the go the emergence of the go

675
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,600
for freud symbolizes the origin of consciousness

676
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,950
finally if this was all there was it might be simpler world

677
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,410
but freud had a third component that i disagree go

678
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:19,670
and the supreme goal is internalized rules of parents and society

679
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,070
so what happens in the course of development is you're just trying to make way

680
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:27,970
through the world satisfy your desires but sometimes you're punished for them

681
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:33,860
some designers are inappropriate some actions are wrong in your punished for

682
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,850
the idea is that you come out you you get in your head

683
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,930
a supreme court conscience

684
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,990
in these movies would be like the little angel above your head that tells you

685
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,640
when things are wrong

686
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,910
and basically yourself the goal is in between

687
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,260
the it

688
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,700
and the super

689
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,300
one thing to realize

690
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:59,210
i told you it is outrageously stupid it just as o

691
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,220
hungry for sets always get warm o

692
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,560
the super eagles is also stupid

693
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,630
the super eagles wonderful is not some brilliant moral philosopher telling you were right and

694
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:16,090
wrong the supreme that you know you should be ashamed of yourself that's disgusting stop

695
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,940
doing that all

696
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,150
and in between these two screaming creatures one of the one of them

697
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,530
tell to secure desires to other one telling you should be ashamed of yourself

698
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,660
is your

699
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,330
is the goal

700
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,290
now according to freud

701
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,530
both of this is unconscious

702
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,560
so we see

703
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,800
bubbling up to the top we feel

704
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,270
we experience

705
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:45,190
and the driving in the forces of the it enforces the super eagles are unconscious

706
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:48,110
in that we cannot access them

707
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,290
we don't know

708
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,800
which is like the workings of our of bar

709
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,650
kidneys or stomachs

710
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:01,220
you can introspect and find them rather they do their work without conscious knowledge

711
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:06,730
developed this is the freudian theory in broad outline

712
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,200
he extended and developed it into a theory

713
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,660
of psychosexual development

714
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,360
so freud's theories as i said before a theory in everyday life

715
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:20,430
decisions of errors of falling in love

716
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,160
but is also the theory of child development

717
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,750
so freud believed there were five stages

718
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,260
of personality development and each is associated with a particular erogenous zone

719
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,300
and for i believe as well

720
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:40,460
that if you have a problem at a certain stage if something goes wrong

721
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,330
you'll be stuck there

722
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,840
so according to freud people in this room are what they are because they got

723
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,260
in oral stage or anal stage

724
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,750
and and

725
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,620
that's not the

726
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,360
the overall stages when you start off

727
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,640
the mouth is associated with pleasure

728
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,450
everything is stopping chewing and so on

729
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,950
and the problem for freud is pre-mature weaning of the child

730
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,140
depriving him of the breast

731
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,270
could lead to serious problems in this personality development it could make him

732
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,740
as the phrase go

733
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,960
goes into an oral person

734
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,190
and it's all relative could be described literally it produces has an explanation for why

735
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,420
and the covariance now if we do that what we get is we finally get

736
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,580
the missing missing update equations right so

737
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,480
we get

738
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,060
the update equation for the mean and we get the update equation for the covariance

739
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,790
matrix so these are just

740
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,880
these are just sort of

741
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,150
technicalities if you will

742
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:47,500
and now interestingly this is the identical same equation we had for k means this

743
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:52,230
is how we computed the updated means of our of our classes right

744
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,310
except now

745
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:57,190
we have soft responsibilities so this is the reason why i ask you to try

746
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,110
to keep those responsibilities in mind

747
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,580
and of course we get an additional equation obviously right which looks very similar to

748
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:09,170
all right

749
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,730
it looks it looks very similar to this but instead of having y i hear

750
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,960
what house they have empirical

751
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,480
covariance is OK so just build them i just compute them empirically

752
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,880
so that's it that's mixtures of

753
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,380
this image is of course is for you

754
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:40,810
OK so i'm going to try to tell you about the in my career in

755
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,940
ten minutes

756
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,210
so i may have us already again but i sort of losing my mind slowly

757
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,170
how o

758
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,940
many of you have actually

759
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,210
has anyone ever implemented in the EM algorithm for anything

760
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,630
about two people OK

761
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,250
and and who sort of familiar with the EM algorithm even if they haven't implemented

762
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:12,170
OK so let's i'm going to try to not bore you too much

763
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,880
one thing we need before we start with the EM algorithm is we need jensen's

764
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,960
inequality OK

765
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,600
what this is what is jensen's inequality say

766
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,270
what it says is

767
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,230
if i have

768
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,630
a function that either convex or concave

769
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,790
this is just a convex

770
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,560
to start with

771
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,080
i have

772
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,480
to data points x one and x two and i can compute the value of

773
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,750
the function

774
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,980
at x one and i can compute the value of the function at x two

775
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,900
and now what i say is

776
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,210
OK fair enough now if i were to compute the value of the function somewhere

777
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,750
between x one and x two

778
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,080
i just think point somewhere

779
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,690
this point is going to be necessarily

780
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,650
the straight line that connects the two function evaluations OK

781
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,380
that's it

782
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,110
that's instance inequality

783
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:13,270
all right and then you can sort of writing in form of equations if you

784
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:21,130
OK so the important thing actually let's remember it for concave because

785
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,730
because what's going to happen next is that we're going to take the logarithm

786
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,750
although likelihood right we're gonna take log likelihood and what we're going to do

787
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:32,610
is going to write the likelihood as an integral which is pretty much the same

788
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:36,040
thing as the some OK here we have the sum of two terms but and

789
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,630
works for for four more terms in the sum

790
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,550
and the log is actually a concave function all right so let's think about the

791
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:47,270
inequality for a concave function for a moment so what does it say

792
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,460
it says that if i take if i evaluate the function

793
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,560
so the concave one of course is going to be the opposite so the function

794
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,500
is going to be above the straight line that connects the points for

795
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,040
so what he says is if a value of the function at any point between

796
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,170
x one x two

797
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:05,940
basically the important thing here is that i have a convex combination of them OK

798
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,480
then i know that this function evaluation is going to be greater than if i

799
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,540
took the convex combination of the individual function evaluations around

800
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,500
is going to be bold

801
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:22,040
so why is this useful

802
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,290
think again about

803
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:30,190
the factor analysis model

804
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:33,460
where we had invented those variables x

805
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,420
i said to you

806
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,960
but you could go in and take the derivatives of the log likelihood right and

807
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,520
then maximise and then sort of

808
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,750
so the two zero to learn wonderland

809
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:48,150
matrix and to learn the noise sign matrix right

810
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,610
to say

811
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,020
it's a little bit use

812
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,830
and it takes a few pages of

813
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:58,650
of derivatives it is possible perfectly possible visible is it is the pain

814
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:01,330
it actually turns out that

815
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,440
instead what you could do which is strictly equivalent is you could use the EM

816
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,790
to achieve the same goal

817
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,100
so let's let's

818
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,330
six ideas here

819
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:18,540
think again about among similar to the to the factor analysis OK

820
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,100
you can also do this for mixtures of gaussians so what are the latent variables

821
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,250
mixtures of gaussians

822
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:27,360
i tell you

823
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,730
exactly the size

824
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:35,060
so the the class memberships of the latent variables have all these customs but i

825
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:35,730
don't know

826
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,060
which one to choose to pick right

827
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,600
so i could do the same thing OK and actually

828
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:45,770
you can you can derive equations we had from mixtures of gaussians you can also

829
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,730
derive by using the algorithm

830
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:51,630
OK so we have some latent variables that were not very interested in in the

831
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:55,940
sense that we're going to be the joint distribution and we just marginalize them out

832
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,400
just like we did for factor analysis OK

833
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,060
and those were the axis so luckily it's the same notation as here

834
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,730
could have been different

835
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:10,130
and then there's there's actually parameters that i'm interested in learning by maximum likelihood

836
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:14,150
and the parameters in the case of factor analysis where the land matrix and also

837
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,900
the matrix side of the knowledge OK in the case of mixtures of gaussians these

838
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,630
were the pie case the means and the covariance matrix is already

839
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:26,190
OK for enough i know that so this thing here obviously is

840
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:29,310
p of y given x times p of x right but i've just written the

841
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:31,980
joint distribution here OK

842
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,540
so you all agree that so far so good i we have logarithms here but

843
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,600
it doesn't matter OK so we know about marginalization

844
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,380
so now

845
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,020
OK now we have this equation far enough

846
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,340
what can we do now now we do allow we do a little strange trick

847
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,880
we multiply

848
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,130
and divide

849
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,670
by an arbitrary distribution

850
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,460
over the latent variables OK

851
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,980
you might think

852
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:05,500
but now observe what we have now we have something where we can plug instance

853
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,440
inequality why is that

854
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:11,230
it's because we have a convex combinations weighted by q of x

855
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,580
all some function evaluations OK so i take this whole thing as my function f

856
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,860
of x OK

857
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,330
the latent variables

858
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,920
OK so how would i apply instant well what i have now is how

859
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,580
the logarithm

860
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,880
of the comics of the convex combination

861
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:34,360
and what we saw earlier is that this is basically a convex

862
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:40,140
liquid phase separate into two groups in order to answer that one that's recall we

863
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,290
ask a similar question when we study

864
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:46,760
statistical physics of magnetism we ask how

865
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:51,090
it is apparent that know how to spontaneously water itself

866
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,940
and we understand

867
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,330
the answer to that paradox

868
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,050
in the following way to neighbours

869
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,130
experience a moment in time

870
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:05,860
interact with one another not only directly through the exchange interaction but also indirectly for

871
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,480
example you can interact with its neighbor the north

872
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,760
which interacts with a the east and the neighbouring the sound

873
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:19,640
here's a similar in the past but this is the human twenty is a measure

874
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,330
of the exchange constant divided by temperature

875
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:29,880
and this comparable contributions of order p fifty seven three nine three eleven three thirteenth

876
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,310
and so forth and the exact enumerations of all these

877
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:39,240
configurations is the robot actively promotes but highly accurate way of learning the properties but

878
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:44,650
others that actually tell us scientifically it tells something really quite interesting that at the

879
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:48,290
heart and my opinion of complex systems

880
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:51,540
what is that what it is is that

881
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:56,580
well there are a lot of each of these powers of necessity must decay exponentially

882
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,180
because of the one-dimensional

883
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,300
on the other hand non has already

884
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:08,830
one to six is increasing and in fact it that increases exponentially because the numbers

885
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:13,510
of marks between any two points increases exponentially

886
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,680
so we have

887
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:22,610
so we have two exponentials an exponential decay in the correlation among but an exponential

888
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,970
increase in the number of

889
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:29,050
the first of these is temperature dependent the second is about

890
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:34,560
therefore by tuning the temperature it becomes possible to define the critical point where these

891
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:41,600
two warring exponentials have standoff continued standard just like the politics of the world that

892
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,670
you mentioned

893
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:48,050
that's the current at the critical point no matter how we use the exchange interaction

894
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:55,850
with infinitesimally we will still be some temperature infinitesimally small with these worrying exponential balance

895
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:59,140
my appreciated that when he asked them

896
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,810
question how does the liquid no independence he a simple jones type liquid

897
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,850
and he said that the

898
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:14,220
the condensed when we think of this as a surprising model potential tools

899
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:17,530
approximate distance apart

900
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:25,280
regarding the interacting otherwise not and then as particles in the gaseous phase get within

901
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,340
the region and start interact there will be the same sort of propagation that described

902
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,660
for the simple magnetic system

903
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,490
but if we accept this sort of reasoning

904
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:41,200
then what is the consequence when we look at the liquid with the bifurcated minimum

905
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:45,780
one might be bifurcated minimum because in the case of what

906
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,850
we used to do

907
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,580
it's possible

908
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:53,260
the two tend to be more active infinite number of ways but two of them

909
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,960
are particularly important

910
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:59,840
one is this which is shown as well number two in that's the way we

911
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:04,570
that because that's what we get in the ice

912
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:10,100
this is the typical hexagon gunawardena the second we can interact

913
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:15,940
is in which the case in which one of these two categories are rotated ninety

914
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,440
so in that case the perpetrator

915
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:26,440
so former tango right configuration and this kind of configuration can approach more closely than

916
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,180
single configuration

917
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,520
and that's what

918
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:35,960
so it's really weird experiences these two

919
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,670
possibilities to link scales on the

920
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:45,890
at low enough temperatures there will be a condensation of the liquid into well number

921
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:52,920
two this low density liquid density because our larger and smaller larger instances small

922
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,510
so in general lengthscales implies of

923
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:01,220
the transition and there's a host of of

924
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:05,360
model systems with two length scales where we can find that

925
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:07,910
the this simple reasoning

926
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:14,810
it makes predictions since the challenge for all who worked in complex systems is to

927
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:20,510
make predictions and compare with experiment because basically physics is an experimental science that's going

928
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:24,990
introduced three from here the compressibility for typically

929
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:32,220
it decreases below the temperature we understand that because in statistical mechanics relating the compressibility

930
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:39,490
is the fluctuations specific what is anomalous because not only the susceptibility like but buffalo

931
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:44,200
forty six sources that actually increases by roughly a factor of two

932
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:50,010
we can understand that increase in volume fluctuations as corresponding to the fluctuations between the

933
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:56,730
two wells that we saw here in the microscopic potential and windows systems work and

934
00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:01,270
decide which was the charmed and it's exactly like gas which can decide whether to

935
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:08,550
jump in the world will not be evenly divided fluctuations increase similar remarks entropy fluctuations

936
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:14,210
because this jumping affects also the entropy and across fluctuations of the most interesting for

937
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:19,570
typical liquid across the regulations which are the coefficient of thermal expansion with positive

938
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:25,700
and we understand that because of two local by means more arrangements in contrast

939
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:32,040
this quantity is very small and below for sources goes negative and again that is

940
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:37,790
come up with the clever was resampling algorithms that it doesn't matter OK what is

941
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,880
more important is basically

942
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,610
the importance sampling

943
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,330
so there's a lot of valuation essentially on the

944
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:53,220
on this title resampling agrees generally speaking well what you're trying to do when you

945
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:58,450
have the resampling egories is that you're trying to build the new approximation of a

946
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:02,040
weighted sum of the mass so that each particle

947
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:07,140
x y has been we copied into good number of time which is denoted capital

948
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:13,450
and so this is the number of offspring of copies of the particle size of

949
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:19,300
those guys there are selected figures number they selected such that the sum to n

950
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,930
because what do you do you want them to some two and simply because you

951
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:27,670
don't want the population of particles to increase over time you want to fix computationally

952
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:30,920
fault so you really want to have those

953
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,300
those numbers to sum to one

954
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:38,220
and if you think of the algorithm was just describing before which was consisting so

955
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:44,250
as to be approximation or sampling approximation to support capital in times of the weighted

956
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:47,980
empirical measure or you know what it means actually just equivalent to say

957
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:53,130
that all these offspring or the number of copies of particle one the number of

958
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:57,500
copies of particle in the number of copies of particle capital in that time and

959
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:05,020
are just distributed according to multinomial distribution with parameter n on the probability of appearance

960
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:08,830
given by the normalized weight okay so that that's about it

961
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:17,090
you know because

962
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,720
when you're doing that you're using this information

963
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,370
so clearly

964
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,160
clearly once you're doing that you just listed

965
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,560
it's from

966
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,220
is an importance sampling

967
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:42,220
distribution is good enough this problem but i agree that that's what i was was

968
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:47,250
saying before that is it is not if you have an importance sampling doing that

969
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,320
doesn't help me in the sense

970
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,950
it's too bad is not

971
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:54,370
that's not going to solve the problem so the key is indeed coming up with

972
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,130
good importance sampling distribution

973
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:01,670
but it what it's not doing so you can come up with better egoism

974
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:05,130
what you have to understand is that

975
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:09,500
when you're doing this kind of resampling operations

976
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:12,170
locally in time it's bad

977
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,600
you have an approximation

978
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:18,940
for example let's go back to

979
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:22,020
the graph of

980
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,070
you an approximation here

981
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,300
of of your target distribution

982
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:30,120
in this case is not very good but even if it was going to be

983
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:35,910
the same thing in for example capital and times on these distribution

984
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,890
you just know noise

985
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,790
it is not going to get any information

986
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,420
what you're doing is you're just

987
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:47,370
i didn't know so you could tell me

988
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:54,920
it's not very clever because now if i look at the violence of estimates

989
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:57,830
the expectation was that time distribution

990
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:00,480
and we all is that the the violence

991
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:06,770
my estimate was picked the recent motion is i the variance of nice team it

992
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:12,640
was picked on the the on that they approximation so it seems that it would

993
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:19,310
crazy what you're doing because we are just introducing locally some all OK

994
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:21,990
so it is bit useless

995
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,120
but the key

996
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:28,270
is that what is the well was the the time when you're doing the resampling

997
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:30,600
you're using in terms of science

998
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:36,490
what you can show is the resampling will be beneficial at each time steps on

999
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:39,160
this in that we should be thinking what i'm telling you you can point me

1000
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:44,740
to articulate and i will give you expression to write it

1001
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:14,090
there are but there is still no reason to do not apply but we can

1002
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:19,230
establish to degrees of there's a wall to wall collection of theoretical results on that

1003
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,100
when we present some of them

1004
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:29,200
so it's possible to steal to obtain valid article results on showing consistent the approximation

1005
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,090
OK so

1006
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:34,900
there's a variety of resampling agrees that have been developed in the early church

1007
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:38,830
i just don't want to go for them it's not only for me i really

1008
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,070
believe that

1009
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,600
this is not the sampling idea is key

1010
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:47,290
in in particle filters after that

1011
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:52,410
understanding all the violations of the something stuff is irrelevant in my opinion so that's

1012
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:56,680
why i will discuss them you can find them you can find description of the

1013
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:01,140
basic sampling basically in any of the

1014
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:05,100
they need to toil on the subject the only thing i'm going to mention is

1015
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:12,160
that typically we always going to try to design a sampling algorithm we shall search

1016
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:17,970
the expectation of the number of offspring of particle i is equal

1017
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,290
two n times to normalise weight

1018
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,780
so that's all you need to know

1019
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:27,040
and when you do that it is in many ways to do it but

1020
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,290
that's king the king

1021
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,740
so now what the new algorithm

1022
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:40,090
the modified version of the categories so i told user contrib something wasn't working so

1023
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:44,300
now what you're doing is that we just having an additional step that consists of

1024
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,320
resampling OK so

1025
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:52,110
let's go back to this question of categories

1026
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:56,950
at time when i'm interested in approximating prx one given y

1027
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,300
i sample capital in particle x one one x one two two x one p

1028
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:02,970
and according

1029
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,020
two part distribution

1030
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:07,960
which is a function of y one on the like that to be as close

1031
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,430
as possible to p of x one y one but

1032
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:18,820
because you cannot use an approximation i compute importance weights are normalized importance weights which

1033
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:23,000
is the ratio between the joint distribution of x one y one divided by the

1034
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,990
importance distribution

1035
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,790
we normalize the weight

1036
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,490
i know what i'm doing

1037
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:33,340
is that essentially i'm gonna resample n times

1038
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:34,300
from the

1039
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:39,990
weighted sum of the masses located in x one essentially but this was something operation

1040
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:46,180
getting one of particles the of the particles with low weights w one i respect

1041
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:51,610
one of them on line particles i went OK that's that's what that's all i'm

1042
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,290
doing well

1043
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,150
now when i have time

1044
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:02,040
we can only sabbatical to two i'm just using the standard basically

1045
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:07,300
so what i've done is because of the station the resampled particles instead of calling

1046
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:11,440
them x one i want to that i just do not then also x one

1047
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:14,300
so be careful this one this set

1048
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,600
of particle particles is not equal to the set is just to avoid having notation

1049
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,550
which after complex at time two

1050
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:29,180
basically you extending all the past by sampling the company xn are according to your

1051
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:33,690
approximation of p xn y y and x minus one u

1052
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:36,150
basically no you can compute

1053
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:38,780
so you know it's just two times

1054
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:42,010
sample value

1055
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:47,120
summer i one to k

1056
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,990
data i

1057
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,200
five as

1058
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:56,730
times iterative of the inside of the constant just cut value

1059
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:59,650
so negative here

1060
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,450
and was sort of this

1061
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:07,080
function suspected data i

1062
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,390
times by

1063
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,360
OK what is this this is

1064
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:17,070
delta t

1065
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:21,040
and this is our feature values so the gradient for every

1066
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,830
way is going to be

1067
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,050
the current mayor times the contribution of that feature

1068
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:33,640
to the air

1069
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:39,660
so the larger feature is the more probably contributed to this

1070
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:44,540
OK and so now i can add the gradient

1071
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,040
so if i get the samples in to dissemble knowing that the gradient and update

1072
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,390
this data ised to move

1073
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,290
two better progress in order to reduce this air

1074
01:00:55,290 --> 01:01:00,550
now surrounded only implicitly earlier member we only had we've always adopted that look like

1075
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:03,780
this was doing was the earliest and say what it was

1076
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,840
OK but now i'm going to send in function approximation case

1077
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:09,960
so just takes on this modified value

1078
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:17,070
the degree of the value function

1079
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,240
times the air

1080
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,340
so it's very simple and a few lines

1081
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,140
if you indicated

1082
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:30,780
now what if you want to do gradient descent for td lambda

1083
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,550
OK so

1084
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,490
this is

1085
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,260
a bit harder

1086
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:39,700
because remember to implement the TV in everything we needed to have an eligibility trace

1087
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:41,870
for every state

1088
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:46,390
but we no longer referring to individual states so how do we have eligibility trace

1089
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,640
in the function approximation case

1090
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:53,710
and the idea comes from generalizations

1091
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:59,750
is there some way to view

1092
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,620
imagine that i had it tends to a problem

1093
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:06,180
can you give me a linear function approximation

1094
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:15,790
that would exactly model the value that NC problem

1095
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:31,020
i've tried here

1096
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:32,840
OK so i state s one

1097
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:38,050
test ten

1098
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,470
so what i could do is the value of

1099
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,050
is the sum over

1100
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:49,610
i cause one to ten

1101
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,440
of data i times indicator function

1102
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:55,790
that says

1103
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:59,570
because they are i

1104
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:03,310
this is zero one function one one single that i

1105
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,280
in zero one s ninety one outside

1106
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:11,340
so this is exactly the way that i can represent a tabular value function value

1107
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:16,490
for every state simply as the linear value function approximation

1108
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:22,190
see that

1109
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:27,140
now if i wanted to plug this value function approximation into this equation i would

1110
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:31,860
simply say the place of five as i just get the indicator

1111
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,390
as eagles outside

1112
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:38,570
one of the different weight that i for every state

1113
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:44,010
i don't know what it is that this gives me exactly back the monte carlo

1114
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:46,820
or the TD methods

1115
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:49,550
the silicon alley elderly tracey's

1116
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,160
kevin previously

1117
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:56,360
it was for assuming that we had indicator functions in a river rivulet integrating view

1118
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:59,610
you can see this working with indicator functions

1119
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:03,550
but we don't have any kind of arch and now we have zero basis functions

1120
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:06,340
so if you only ever previously on

1121
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:10,870
state side in the function phi space in case they should now be

1122
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:16,220
the other the operational beyond just the general weights data i

1123
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:20,120
with that i no longer corresponds roughly to state

1124
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:23,640
but in general to some basis functions so now we're going to say not how

1125
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:27,710
notable the state to be updated how eligible is a parameter to be updated how

1126
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:30,140
well how how much this parameter

1127
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,370
i participate in previous

1128
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:35,360
in previous states that we saw

1129
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:43,480
just following inside so it if you have that inside then you can see

1130
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,180
that the eligibility trace update is the same as before

1131
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,850
the discounted version of the previous algorithms race

1132
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,970
plus the gradient

1133
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:57,730
value function in again when we just by this is that the value function is

1134
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:59,770
the exact presentation

1135
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,000
you get back exactly

1136
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:03,740
the the case we had before

1137
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,260
for the exact case

1138
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:13,490
so that's a special case of this

1139
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,310
OK because

1140
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:22,850
the gradient right

1141
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:48,160
the squared error gives a linear function which is a quite notable

1142
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:51,820
OK certainly this is convex in the parameters

1143
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:54,680
the parameterizes quadratic

1144
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:59,240
what happens is when you're far away from the minimum

1145
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:01,720
you know the gradient steeper

1146
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,470
when it closer to the minimum degree is more shallow

1147
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:06,160
so inherently

1148
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:10,140
the squared error gives you a nice out of opposition problem if you look at

1149
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,990
the absolute value here

1150
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:16,300
you you you get the problem

1151
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:18,320
and the problem here is

1152
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:20,790
if you're up here

1153
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:22,030
you don't know

1154
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:27,720
if you look a little less information how far you go

1155
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,990
OK so should you step a big stuff

1156
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:36,820
you know if if you shot too far you might

1157
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,580
get over here my oscillate

1158
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,550
back and forth

1159
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:44,070
but you get little the less information about

1160
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:48,750
when to converge is really hard at this point exactly where is naturally the gradient

1161
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,330
is the playing three

1162
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:55,820
with the arab because it's just a randomized algorithm so and the more that we

1163
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:58,230
run our upon smaller

1164
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:02,130
we want to we don't want to run lots of

1165
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:07,510
monte carlo simulation only want to round the monte carlo simulations so that we already

1166
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:12,550
we know the exact answer

1167
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:17,060
here the main idea of doing this is we just keep doing the monte carlo

1168
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:21,620
simulation and then we just i have is that we check is answer is already

1169
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:26,120
clear if are clear we do not really need to know the exact out with

1170
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,890
probability right

1171
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:33,280
for example if we have policy what five possible answers and we have zero one

1172
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,450
as the range of the output probability

1173
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:39,590
after fields that the monte carlo simulation

1174
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:45,770
there are trueprobability has been constrained to a certain range

1175
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,110
here we can see that g three

1176
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,210
should be in the top two list

1177
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:56,670
because the smallest possible probability article probability of g street is higher than the other

1178
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:59,640
three people possible answers

1179
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:03,460
and also we know that g five cannot be in the

1180
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:08,240
because the highest possible probability of g five it's more of than g two and

1181
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,700
g three

1182
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:14,460
once we can determine that to which one is in the top two that we

1183
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:18,600
can start with don't we do not want to continue their simulation again

1184
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:25,850
so this is actually one hundred simulation is very effective and efficient method for evaluating

1185
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:31,620
higher is considered data not only for the this ranking queries of the

1186
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:36,620
so i think the more this year the proposed very efficient among kind of simulation

1187
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:42,820
first of all this separated schema and uncertain variables

1188
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:50,540
so for each each other's viable we start with the generation functions

1189
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:54,570
so that it can be easily used to do the robot kind of simulation

1190
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,330
and they instead of

1191
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:01,940
the naive of information that we run one kind of simulation a few times we

1192
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:04,020
have the following improvements

1193
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,830
because database

1194
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:11,080
i have some efficient mechanism to help with two out of the car in the

1195
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:16,400
so we do not around one kind simulation one by one we run them together

1196
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:18,900
we can have some

1197
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,400
they improvements on this and also

1198
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:26,800
because one uncertain about variable can have different possible values

1199
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:30,360
if we start them all in the database should be very costly so we do

1200
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:35,860
not do that we only material right one of the ranch but only when it

1201
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,950
possible we generate value

1202
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:45,070
and also during the carrier violations that of some sub queries can be discarded with

1203
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,310
no need to store them all the time so we should be able to

1204
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:53,420
produce them when necessary and discard it when we do not we do not use

1205
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:58,920
the value so those are three in efficient implementation for the monte carlo simulation

1206
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:03,700
more details can be referred to this paper

1207
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:07,840
and the last quarry want to talk about is the efficient

1208
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:10,190
the skyline query answering

1209
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,770
so those got harry is very helpful in decision making

1210
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:17,330
for example again we use the NBA data example

1211
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:22,110
so we want to choose that if we consider the number of assistance and number

1212
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:26,060
of points and the two techniques that we want to look into

1213
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:31,140
so we always want to select NBA players who has

1214
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:34,550
a large number of assists a large number of points

1215
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:38,080
so for example here b b has

1216
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,050
smaller number of assists and smaller number of points that c

1217
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,470
of course we do not want to feel like b

1218
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,560
so in this case being dominated by c

1219
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:53,600
so the skyline of the quarry data that is the object whose not dominated by

1220
01:10:55,270 --> 01:11:00,500
nothing to show sky hiring so in certain they died

1221
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:04,560
very you need to see causing the skull and i have a few efficient method

1222
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,660
to compute the skyline by uncertain data sets at least that we have three doctors

1223
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:13,090
in the heats up to have a few instances

1224
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:17,590
it's even not clear to us who sing the skyline

1225
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,990
so not to mention how to answer the curry efficiently

1226
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,580
so the first task is to

1227
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,010
develop a good

1228
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:31,080
skyline definition in uncertain data with good meaning

1229
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:36,640
so we again we use the possible worlds semantics we we suppose here we have

1230
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:42,250
one possible world of this uncertainty data that we select one instance for each object

1231
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:45,800
and here in each possible world that they live search

1232
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:48,560
and the skyline is certain so

1233
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:52,620
a one and b one day the skyline possible world

1234
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:56,560
if we have all the possible worlds we can see that b is in the

1235
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,560
skyline of the falling for possible world

1236
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:02,690
so the probability that the thing the skyline

1237
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,830
it the fan of the probability of of possible worlds

1238
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:10,990
we call the skyline probability

1239
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:16,550
that user may want to find the skyline found objects whose in the dialogue with

1240
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:18,090
a large probability

1241
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:21,310
so again we use threshold of p

1242
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:26,890
so p skyline contains all of the objects whose probability of being the skyline is

1243
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:29,070
greater or equal to p

1244
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,900
so we want to tackle this problem

1245
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,290
and we use the following framework

1246
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:37,590
it contains three that's bonding pruning and refining

1247
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,600
in the first that we found the and probability

1248
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:45,280
and this bombing so we have a lower upon upon they can be used in

1249
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,600
the pruning in the pretty part

1250
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:51,840
if the but then all the lower bound and upper bound is not tight enough

1251
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,630
to help the pruning we can do the refinement

1252
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:59,460
so this is we just do this iteration

1253
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:04,010
in the refining refining that we can see we have to

1254
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:10,080
method to help the refinement why is the bottom-up method taken the top-down method

1255
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:17,400
i just industries very simple idea very briefly we do not go into the details

1256
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:19,040
so in the bonding

1257
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,510
for example here

1258
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:25,710
this is what method so the only but what the method

1259
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:28,470
this is generally based on this key ideas

1260
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,000
if we have two instances in the same up to it

1261
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:35,500
so this is an instance of the same sort of two

1262
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,470
the there's they have dominant relationship

1263
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,520
right so

1264
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,040
for example here use three is dominant by you one

1265
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:48,730
so in some possible world is useful if you story is in the skyline

1266
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:52,040
value one must be also in the skyline

1267
01:13:52,840 --> 01:14:00,270
based on this dominance relationship we can have this inequality of all the

1268
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,830
instances of the same of the object

1269
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,550
which means we only one we

1270
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:09,720
compute the skull probability of those

1271
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:15,050
some of the things that we can efficiently find those rest of the instances

1272
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:15,710
so o

1273
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:21,320
that's what we do in the bottom said we we compute the skull and probability

1274
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:26,140
of the things that one by one from the most dominant player

1275
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:29,970
that was my concern

1276
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:33,610
i have to tell you

1277
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:38,110
he and his wife was there at the time had been having a difficult time

1278
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:39,570
in their marriage

1279
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:44,860
they reunited that weekend

1280
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,360
because you know that

1281
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:50,320
it was very very emotional

1282
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:52,610
suddenly you know objects

1283
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:55,930
really get to the heart of things when you have to tell the stories about

1284
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,160
when he left left

1285
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,510
but now before the rest of us

1286
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:04,570
and suddenly somebody came

1287
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:07,590
one of the staff of the hotel where we were

1288
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:10,950
said he left is behind

1289
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:15,110
and they put on the table is farthest cup

1290
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:17,140
he left further behind

1291
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,220
i tell you

1292
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:22,490
it's a wonderful way

1293
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:26,800
OK i think a lot of things but i'm trying to say is rather elaborate

1294
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:32,380
you know we need to concentrate a bit more

1295
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:33,840
on the fly

1296
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:38,610
management education and of suppressing the to do it this way

1297
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:42,360
but it's the way that we found i i have to tell you

1298
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:45,010
i think it's terribly terribly important

1299
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:47,930
you know how you do things

1300
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:50,860
that's very important of course but it's not whole

1301
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:55,800
in this funny world war i i really believe that we got to make capitalism

1302
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,220
work for everybody

1303
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,530
businesses in the times

1304
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:03,360
they are the instruments of capitalism

1305
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:08,840
people have got to understand why they're doing what to do

1306
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,010
the people in them

1307
01:16:10,010 --> 01:16:14,680
i got to understand why they're doing what they're doing i mean if only the

1308
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,240
bankers to set

1309
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:22,090
one often and why was he doing these things is not supposed to be doing

1310
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:24,360
this suppose we translating money

1311
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:27,260
people who got more of it to the people who need to use it not

1312
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:32,180
just running around taking half of one percent as it goes but it not meant

1313
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,840
to be

1314
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,280
but they got caught up in the house

1315
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:37,990
the summary in the box

1316
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,700
because that's kind of why

1317
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:45,050
i have

1318
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:48,320
one more thing to say to you

1319
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:52,410
when we done all these things

1320
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:56,260
i tell the story

1321
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,590
i said some years ago

1322
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:02,400
two years ago as well and i were in delhi

1323
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:05,320
i the the the call centers

1324
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:09,130
that worked actually for AOL and l

1325
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:13,570
basically they were working for american customers

1326
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:16,590
we went there to five o'clock in the morning

1327
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:18,610
the people were just coming to work

1328
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:20,410
and the call centers

1329
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:25,240
so they could respond to the americans in the data back in denver colorado where

1330
01:17:26,410 --> 01:17:29,590
the image these indians

1331
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,820
and that's our

1332
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:34,970
indian dress

1333
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:37,930
and they went to the changing rooms

1334
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:42,240
and they changed into american clothes jeans and t-shirts

1335
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,990
they they change their names

1336
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:46,510
parameter names to american name

1337
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:48,550
and they set down for half an hour

1338
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:51,070
a much american so

1339
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:53,360
so they could get

1340
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,530
back into an american world

1341
01:17:55,530 --> 01:18:00,910
learn to speak once again the slight american ex the whole idea being when you

1342
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:05,590
ran the call centre in denver colorado decent american you don't want to think you're

1343
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:09,630
talking to delhi india you want to think you're talking to someone in kansas city

1344
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,360
which leads to here

1345
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:13,720
so they pretend that

1346
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,930
to be american for the night

1347
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:17,950
and in the morning

1348
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:20,820
they change back into being indians again

1349
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,610
and this one i will horrify

1350
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:25,680
what life must be

1351
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:29,950
to be two different people in one day

1352
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:33,720
and i thought oh my god when i was in charge

1353
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:40,110
i would put on a funny dark suit that normally wear

1354
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,680
i was going to that below

1355
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,970
i have to tell you

1356
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:45,910
i really

1357
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:50,380
i think my values changed a bit and i entered that building

1358
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:55,470
i left by other cells by i talk to the different voices

1359
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:59,570
i bought differently i behave differently

1360
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:00,590
in england

1361
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:01,590
it is always

1362
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:05,480
well understood his young is technically better is able to make new things

1363
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:07,180
so the goal of that

1364
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,800
is not to make this to them close to the teacher is to make this

1365
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,930
a better teacher

1366
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:17,590
well if you look at machine learning is the the way we see things and

1367
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,630
we certainly one

1368
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:25,600
well to explain these movies this kind of stranded language the

1369
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:28,210
it seems to be very non objectives

1370
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:30,020
that's going to help

1371
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:31,470
this to them

1372
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:35,840
to improve and even get the teacher

1373
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:42,880
so let me idea of using this as the input more than using the kind

1374
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,430
of language

1375
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,800
so there is technical and actually say we're going to be again

1376
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:51,790
we have pixel space for the commission

1377
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,460
and there was a holistic language where you're going to have some

1378
01:19:55,470 --> 01:19:59,730
which is going to be understood and what did you know it's more on the

1379
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,150
is small

1380
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:05,050
it's more feasible party everything helped the machine

1381
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,050
to organize better

1382
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:10,770
isn't it looks like a crazy idea

1383
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:12,930
you know the original digits

1384
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:16,010
if you think that means that if the rule is easy

1385
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:19,680
so we make them was weaker than the system again

1386
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:24,140
now is getting really difficult commission problem

1387
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,720
from digits

1388
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:34,470
but many edits as one of his find is the point in russia

1389
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:37,400
to write poems about the digital

1390
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:41,500
so think each of the example not so many of them because writing lots this

1391
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,070
it's very

1392
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,130
these are expensive features

1393
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:48,720
so here is the description of five new

1394
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:49,610
so the mean

1395
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:55,070
when of being within russian translated into english

1396
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:59,170
so can we help machine recommended by feeding it

1397
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:06,800
with this kind of information

1398
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:10,430
so they met some kind

1399
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,260
including the point

1400
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,860
it's shocking

1401
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:16,940
when i to partners planting this has

1402
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:23,190
shock piercing to during this running this flexibility so that fifteen features that are extracted

1403
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:28,720
from the poem and he the courts to classify the points according to that

1404
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,980
here's what we get

1405
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:37,290
this is not music this is individual this is a very strict domain

1406
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:40,130
the training data size

1407
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:42,510
and the number of rules

1408
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:47,430
you do on the test set i think it's recognising five minutes against that

1409
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:49,130
the green line of the

1410
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:51,010
also you do

1411
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:53,680
when you take increase the training data size

1412
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:56,470
from something like thirty to one hundred

1413
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:02,340
the very more very small training set very corrupted digits tren now extremely noisy

1414
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:05,500
and what you see that if you had to support description

1415
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:07,680
at the beginning doesn't make a difference

1416
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:11,130
and at some point you start to get a little bit better

1417
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:12,390
not much

1418
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:14,270
a little bit

1419
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:18,830
and this has been hashed rehashed and getting statistically correct because for this thing we

1420
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:22,470
can this world of examples from training we don't have so many points of this

1421
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:26,840
thing can forward

1422
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:31,640
that's very fine example where by using this for

1423
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:36,040
language are made on the fly reported description of digits you can actually make the

1424
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,180
commission but

1425
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:38,540
of course

1426
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,220
if you want an explanation of that

1427
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,840
it's not going to be easy

1428
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,980
but it works

1429
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:53,260
so here is the big picture as letting you see

1430
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,810
fifty years ago

1431
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:56,400
machine learning researchers

1432
01:22:56,420 --> 01:22:58,110
that means he

1433
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:01,540
but analyzing the parameterisation

1434
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:07,800
they introduced the VC entropy VC dimension and show that there were the important thing

1435
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,610
things of this is if you think about the US economy or an economy has

1436
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:15,490
been depicted by an input output people most of you have some idea what input

1437
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:21,250
output tables open up matrix that there are lots and lots of positive coefficients in

1438
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:22,130
the matrix

1439
01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:26,790
and so there are lots of complicated interconnections within the economy

1440
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:33,700
so that you know if if there's a bad harvest in indonesia

1441
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:41,090
o clock saint petersburg across the river here will stop because of you know ten

1442
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:46,610
layers of connection between you know the rice crop in indonesia and the functioning of

1443
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:52,340
the clock and saint petersburg all this long string of input output connections that somehow

1444
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:53,760
eventually lead to the

1445
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:56,740
o clock stopping the saint peter's her

1446
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,030
OK so this is complicated it's

1447
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:04,160
and maybe that's complex people with complexity but that that's

1448
01:24:04,190 --> 01:24:06,860
slightly different than i think a lot of people

1449
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:11,720
let's move on from this section

1450
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:17,850
well the eldest item to be about minor elements through a little bit on this

1451
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:20,530
company to computability so

1452
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:25,840
we've got to the main part of it

1453
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:30,610
group of people here i have some of them are listed here

1454
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:37,350
a leader of this group is composed documents are made available online

1455
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:43,070
is developing something called computable economics does define point distinction

1456
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:50,040
many of you are aware of computational economics you may not be aware computable economics

1457
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:51,510
slight distinction

1458
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,340
computational economics courses

1459
01:24:54,440 --> 01:25:01,300
all the figuring out useful program for doing computer simulations running models and so on

1460
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,180
and so forth

1461
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:09,150
compute the economics of worried about the deeper issues are systems actually compute

1462
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,910
in this trade off into problems of logic

1463
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:20,640
and really the question how do you define computational or computable complexity

1464
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:28,120
now there's been this long development starting really with shannon science concept entropy definition of

1465
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:35,160
information several people talk about kolmogorov has falling off in china

1466
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:38,940
well the various definitions try especially

1467
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:46,390
link this to the old arguments about incompleteness really undecidability and uncomputability if you want

1468
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:52,680
a the bottom line definition of what is computable true computable complexity it's a non

1469
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,150
trillion uncomputable now

1470
01:25:57,170 --> 01:26:00,150
what does this really mean it means ultimately

1471
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,830
that there is no

1472
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:07,350
the halting problem i mean this was mentioned by christopher connor set of intuitively

1473
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:13,100
the various definitions of computable complexity has something to do with how long the the

1474
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:16,170
best program will take to solve the system

1475
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:22,540
variations on the face of ways got about fifteen i'll show you some of the

1476
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:24,970
equations for a better one met here

1477
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,160
but that's sort of the intuitive notion of truly

1478
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:37,310
computable system in fact has an infinite time it doesn't solve it goes to toulouse

1479
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:41,540
or just wanders around it just never gets no results

1480
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:43,620
the whole the problem is now

1481
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,140
infinite time

1482
01:26:45,190 --> 01:26:49,040
now lots and lots of systems that people think are computable are

1483
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:52,350
the mandelbrot set for

1484
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:58,440
it's not too chaotic dynamics are not computable actually there's a series of papers by

1485
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:02,110
some of the some of the localised allies

1486
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:04,540
i don't have listed here

1487
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:08,180
list this particular part of paper people like dora

1488
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:13,610
brazilian mathematicians and prosciutto some other showing things like

1489
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:19,700
actually the and should always in general are ultimately not compute for all sorts of

1490
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:23,930
things that we take for the supermarket people that they really really

1491
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:24,840
they are

1492
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,650
if you look at the very very close

1493
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:32,130
computationally comes might say well that's not such a big deal because is really

1494
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:35,900
OK OK we know we we may not be able to the absolutely right answer

1495
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:40,300
what is actually gets back proof of child labour in our fixed point there but

1496
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:42,270
not going to foreign

1497
01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:46,950
i mean only going down again can you really really really get that fixed point

1498
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,870
and for all

1499
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:52,590
i say the computational viewpoint so we don't really want to get into that the

1500
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:59,250
people wearing about all this terrible logical problems really matters you know if you get

1501
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:02,590
within some ball from at one radius

1502
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:07,540
chris problems if system is really not computable you can't necessarily guarantee even that may

1503
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:13,140
not be the best properties with some degree of probability we are with walrus well

1504
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:16,900
that may be notable enough for government work or whatever it may be good enough

1505
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:20,930
for all practical purposes we that we don't actually need to have everything out of

1506
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,590
how many decimal points it

1507
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:26,930
we can get out a couple of small points with some degree probably had a

1508
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:29,570
big enough for policy work or what

1509
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:33,800
so that's that's sort of part of the target

1510
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:37,670
a point x is that some others have made is that some of these computational

1511
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:44,330
definitions themselves are not computable this includes the common graph definition all of you in

1512
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:50,170
the track these are actually do i'll show you your mcsane and stochastic

1513
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:53,600
after the stuff

1514
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:59,490
you think you are right we go so here i have is extremely short spend

1515
01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:03,000
any time because we want move on to the fish but you have here if

1516
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,250
you read this carefully and human

1517
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:06,920
the current through it

1518
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:09,400
about is compressed as you're going to get description

1519
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:11,240
the stochastic

1520
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:14,160
complexity measure which is a more generalized

1521
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:18,030
definition of computational complexity that is computed

1522
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:21,890
OK so people like philip like very excited this is great this is what we

1523
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:24,170
have i gather

1524
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:29,030
debates among people like assign in china and others about all this but

1525
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:32,580
i'm going to buy that this quite generalized

1526
01:29:32,590 --> 01:29:37,670
definition is is computed so where does this leave in a sense the the computable

1527
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:39,330
complexity people so high

1528
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:45,390
once we finally get the same in stochastic complexity we have a really no solid

1529
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:48,860
measure definition complexity

1530
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:53,800
this is it and this is better than all this because he was the stuff

1531
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:59,570
of dynamic revolutionary views of the emergence hand-waving about this and that

1532
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:04,240
evolution we don't know what you know this

1533
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:07,930
just a couple of comments here one is that

1534
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:09,070
in this case

1535
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:13,040
one one of my defenses of the dynamic definition is that we actually have a

1536
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,610
sort of more useful

1537
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,030
what if you will

1538
01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:19,150
between what's complex was not complex

1539
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:21,810
a lot of systems are not complex

1540
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,820
but many

1541
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,930
in this new in sense everything is ultimately complex is really nothing it's not complex

1542
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:33,620
what you have to have in some sense a measure is very degrees complexity but

1543
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:35,940
there's nothing it's in some sense simple

1544
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:38,600
he will not complex

1545
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:43,560
the dynamic definition all kinds of models all kinds of systems are not complex

1546
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:49,350
which i think is useful here you've got might say more precise

1547
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:53,740
measures the degrees of complexity that that has a lot of these including up to

1548
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:57,290
this point we make this going to jump to the higher level or

1549
01:30:57,450 --> 01:30:58,820
the halting problem

1550
01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:00,330
infinite time

1551
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:04,600
it's truly company and actually that point you have like with some of the

1552
01:31:04,610 --> 01:31:07,960
some of the dynamic complexity some of these systems are not

1553
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,040
like the mandelbrot set

1554
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,920
do doing that underlie

1555
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:18,950
are linked with when when you put them into some kind of dynamic model i

1556
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:21,900
think this is applied sociology it certainly applies in economics

1557
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,240
you get a dynamic system that will be

1558
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:29,670
dynamically complex and the definition is given let me move on

1559
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:32,700
because this must be logic

1560
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:36,090
and it it doesn't have distribution distribution fails

1561
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:39,030
a lot of people have fast about this

1562
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:48,820
distribution fails in this mission or one thing they do like is this there

1563
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:51,340
you might want to distinguish between us

1564
01:31:52,910 --> 01:31:55,220
the more you can drive

1565
01:31:55,330 --> 01:32:03,190
because this could be just read is

1566
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:05,860
if you have any could derive you can one

1567
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:09,620
and you can run into the same time we can do both

1568
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:14,340
it is but you might have to pick which one

1569
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:18,480
this tells us we can do about the same time so make that distinction but

1570
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:21,960
there are some logicians

1571
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:26,880
who just think that this is a completely irrelevant to linear logic and all want

1572
01:32:27,030 --> 01:32:32,580
is what he called is called multiplicative connectives right because

1573
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:34,480
represented like this

1574
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:42,690
the resulting logic that removes and the conjunction disjunction

1575
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:50,530
the negation is called multiplicative linear logic and actually i can find multiplicative linear logic

1576
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:56,720
quite a reasonable way talking about resources also it's a nice way of talking about

1577
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,780
information flow

1578
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,590
an interim it people interacting together

1579
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:09,660
about information

1580
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:21,380
actually i believe the information plus the side

1581
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:30,620
so a stamps abramsky

1582
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:36,610
at oxford has very nice website lots of papers that he's not about that

1583
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:41,990
representing information flow and is beautiful slides but to to do all that stuff would

1584
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:45,680
take me a while and not really i don't know

1585
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:49,810
it's this this horrible thing when you get it start lecturing i could talk about

1586
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:52,560
this ten i even i have prepared as well

1587
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,210
stick to what i've prepared

1588
01:33:54,230 --> 01:33:56,870
a better idea the next

1589
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:01,880
four of

1590
01:34:01,890 --> 01:34:05,380
of substructural logic

1591
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:07,230
has to do with

1592
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:09,010
uses in linguistics

1593
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:17,340
in linguistics

1594
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:33,220
one in the area of linguistics is the theory of grammar or the theory of

1595
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:42,430
developed in the twentieth century most by chance a chance given his followers

1596
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:48,060
back in the nineteen fifties joe lambek

1597
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,260
a sequent calculus

1598
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:56,330
four categorial grammars and it's quite radically

1599
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:02,380
are so substructural rejects a lot of such a structure rules

1600
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:08,390
think about english

1601
01:35:08,410 --> 01:35:10,100
and we'll have a

1602
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:12,870
one of my dogs named lola

1603
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:15,690
they're the ones named after

1604
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:16,740
the mathematician

1605
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:22,780
the smell of similar frankel separation called him a lot because she's she's girl the

1606
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:25,440
absence of some of the boys name

1607
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:29,080
time lola

1608
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:35,180
and i should never frankel but the fact is not really a good name for

1609
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:39,310
a girl and also

1610
01:35:39,570 --> 01:35:43,580
i inherited her i didn't give her name

1611
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:49,170
he's an old man she sleeps on so i was when i wrote this i

1612
01:35:49,170 --> 01:35:53,590
would turn around and she was on asleep as usual

1613
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:55,720
so little asleep OK

1614
01:35:55,770 --> 01:36:03,680
back in school you may have learned

1615
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:08,910
to think of subject and the predicate here will be a little more technical think

1616
01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:10,980
you need to go to

1617
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:13,500
there's something

1618
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:18,410
with respect to what you will probably see in the next less as to what

1619
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:21,940
we will less the neural nets in

1620
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:31,020
neural nets modelling dynamical system can be seen sometimes independence of a kind of war

1621
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:39,830
using it as non-linear out or aggressive exultant was put more so sometimes it's possible

1622
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:46,450
here is the reality we have a linear out aggressive model in which the output

1623
01:36:46,450 --> 01:36:48,360
is not even by

1624
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:50,110
he simple

1625
01:36:50,110 --> 01:36:53,240
linear transformations of the past

1626
01:36:53,280 --> 01:37:00,030
past years but is given by an order of the formation of the past

1627
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:07,780
this is this can be implemented for example using a neuron

1628
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:14,020
but it doesn't change the overall picture of modelling this time series when

1629
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:20,920
let's say part of that was not known and we can model noise is we

1630
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:24,710
can think about noise is unknown input of driver

1631
01:37:24,730 --> 01:37:27,000
one of the system

1632
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:31,230
thinking about the i don't know if you

1633
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:37,450
already had lecture about bayesian networks

1634
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:38,940
yes no

1635
01:37:41,030 --> 01:37:43,460
so by the

1636
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:45,390
in this way

1637
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:49,240
to see this kind of dynamic from all those

1638
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:51,820
in the more general

1639
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:59,780
situation in the more general framework in which for example we can easily be represented

1640
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:02,790
through dynamic bayesian networks

1641
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,540
outer aggressive more the

1642
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:13,820
which is actually of course non-linear if we think of discrete systems so we can

1643
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:16,020
predict the next value

1644
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:20,410
also you should be OK not

1645
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:21,830
OK minus one

1646
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:28,070
so we can predict the next value of the time series of in the past

1647
01:38:29,410 --> 01:38:35,450
and here we have a dynamic bayesian network this is a way to represent the

1648
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:39,130
non-linear out of aggressive more

1649
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:41,600
bayesian networks are also easy

1650
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:47,850
that it's possible to provide a stochastic version

1651
01:38:47,870 --> 01:38:48,780
all the

1652
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:53,110
this the equations in the state space

1653
01:38:53,130 --> 01:38:58,770
that we discussed in the in the first part of the talk

1654
01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:02,940
you see a bayesian network

1655
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:07,070
you you have to think that here we have time so this this time

1656
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:09,110
or k

1657
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:15,060
this this time kate minus one so we have the dynamic which is practiced by

1658
01:39:15,060 --> 01:39:17,520
the transition of the state

1659
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:19,870
then in most

1660
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:23,920
and here we have the output variables

1661
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:29,740
OK so here we have the stochastic version of the output function of the output

1662
01:39:29,740 --> 01:39:35,710
transformation that we previously discussed when we introduce the dynamical systems

1663
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:38,440
and here we have the stochastic version

1664
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:43,310
transition function between the state variables

1665
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:49,860
three movements from classical dynamic systems theory

1666
01:39:50,830 --> 01:39:59,020
stochastic processes and by the way image was also part of the which we can

1667
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:03,900
represent the same course it's the same system

1668
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:12,860
using a different thing within a different framework which is here the the framework of

1669
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:19,360
stochastic model in using bayesian networks we can use it present what is known in

1670
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:22,230
the literature kalman filters or

1671
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:26,280
he then markov models

1672
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:29,420
everything is connected to everything in fact

1673
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:33,260
this cytokine immune so can activity

1674
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:38,580
is probably is the band's a network

1675
01:40:38,590 --> 01:40:40,990
as has been

1676
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:47,250
describe compared to social systems of food webs brain neurons

1677
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:53,750
it's about the same problem maybe twice as dense but when one looks at protein

1678
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:57,090
structure transcription factors the world wide web

1679
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:01,360
it's orders of magnitude more than so sister

1680
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:10,620
that is managed complex system that's managing another complex systems it does it by

1681
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:19,440
can of complexity within its subsets one complexity looking at another complexity and another feature

1682
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:22,360
is that there are motifs

1683
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:29,390
in these very these are just try three connection which are

1684
01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:35,810
a very over-simplification of the kinds of actual connection between cells in the body and

1685
01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:39,510
the immune system but even at this level

1686
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:41,450
they have a preferred

1687
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:50,320
organisations of elements talking to one another and in fact they are

1688
01:41:50,550 --> 01:41:58,140
interactions that outlawed that are not permitted interesting just as

1689
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:02,320
you can observe that the kinds of interactions that are not

1690
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:09,390
in these cytokine networks within the immune system between the immune system and the body

1691
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:12,500
interactions that are dictatorial

1692
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:14,920
there are known knowns

1693
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:17,710
that only telling us what to do

1694
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:22,410
the the the most prominent ones are totally

1695
01:42:22,740 --> 01:42:27,620
click so it's unlikely it's and one can organize

1696
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:35,530
twenty nine are with a for fifteen different kinds of cell types according to their

1697
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:39,620
twenty nine different connections and get very interesting

1698
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:43,830
architecture structure

1699
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:46,280
depending on whether

1700
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:56,550
the edges are mutually whether the cingulate gyrus single-engine are multiple saying edges in whatever

1701
01:42:56,580 --> 01:43:00,610
and the different cell functions

1702
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:04,180
really sort out

1703
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:08,800
in a way that we can begin to understand their

1704
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:15,280
they're biological function and just give you an example at the bottom here the same

1705
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:16,760
as the most

1706
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:21,330
one way control into what is the killer cell this is

1707
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,120
a lymphocyte

1708
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:25,140
now the capacity to carry

1709
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:27,640
so is in the body

1710
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:33,160
and it makes sense that in doing this kind of even very primitive architecture it's

1711
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:35,250
so that has the strongest

1712
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:42,650
two others which are telling it what to do

1713
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:47,280
that's as mutual connections with these black

1714
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:53,890
edges but it has a preponderance of tight control

1715
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:59,810
if we take so the the macrophage which is the and its evolution only the

1716
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:08,360
the in in the most primitive of multicellular organisms so that performs immune functions in

1717
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:16,410
the sense of fighting off invaders are identifying and eating invaders healing wounds and so

1718
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:22,430
on this macrophage the the evolution of the

1719
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:28,920
the progenitor of the immune system is the sum of the parts to everybody

1720
01:44:29,070 --> 01:44:32,060
receives information from everybody and then through

1721
01:44:32,670 --> 01:44:36,310
the evolution of the innate system

1722
01:44:36,330 --> 01:44:42,190
into the adaptive system with cells that make antibodies recognise energies and so we get

1723
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:47,030
the proliferation of

1724
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,780
information and structure

1725
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:53,670
we can take the same kinds of the edges

1726
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:58,740
and look at the organisation cells of the body one gets really

1727
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:02,400
a different kind of architecture

1728
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:08,090
there's a lot of architecture seems to sort of

1729
01:45:08,130 --> 01:45:14,750
biological function and we can make some observations about what we see in in the

1730
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:17,990
architecture the immune system in the body is

1731
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:19,620
connected by

1732
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:28,130
cytokines we can see that complexity increases over evolution as i said the first creature

1733
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:32,370
multicellular creatures had only macrophage is that

1734
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:37,080
as a through over evolutionary time we see

1735
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:44,680
more complexity of molecules more complexity of functions being generated from these macrophages we get

1736
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:52,490
all sorts of other leukocyte cell lymphocytes we generate complex networks

1737
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:53,330
and if we

1738
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:56,270
look at these particular functions

1739
01:45:56,270 --> 01:45:59,980
the molecules and so the networks themselves

1740
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:06,450
results of the general there's no one to one relationship between any of them

1741
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:12,290
but various molecules will interact with various

1742
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:19,500
receptors a single receptor and to interact with various molecules and that goes for some

1743
01:46:19,570 --> 01:46:26,780
reason for the networks themselves of degenerate in their interactions are pleiotropic the same molecule

1744
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:32,580
can do at least the way we define function carrier

1745
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:35,770
a function in development

1746
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:41,860
in in the area under the uterus the same set can perform an unknown function

1747
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:49,510
outside and is the individual develops the same molecule can perform the function and aging

1748
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:54,830
and cancer and so on in infection the same with with cells

1749
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:58,120
the same so can do different things different cells

1750
01:46:58,150 --> 01:47:02,130
can do do the same thing different molecules can do the same thing different networks

1751
01:47:02,130 --> 01:47:06,300
so we have the system which is the general the tropics

1752
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,950
and redundant

1753
01:47:07,990 --> 01:47:09,690
in which there

1754
01:47:09,710 --> 01:47:17,780
and one-to-one relationships and everything mistaken and when when they find the things that i

1755
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:21,520
want one relationships and designs this molecule to do

1756
01:47:21,530 --> 01:47:29,470
one interaction you want your opinion without it so

1757
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:32,550
this is a

1758
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:37,740
these lessons mean things to us now is this complexity

1759
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:41,060
that as i said in the system

1760
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:47,630
is less complex and you want to measure it there's no antigen recognition of the

1761
01:47:47,630 --> 01:47:50,120
networks are few and very simple

1762
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:56,200
but interestingly the massive multicellular life on earth

1763
01:47:56,220 --> 01:48:00,950
although plants all the insects

1764
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:01,980
well the

1765
01:48:01,990 --> 01:48:08,700
what makes up most of the mass of life is so everybody

1766
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,570
but to be linear functional

1767
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:11,480
it's not

1768
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:15,320
the integral over the differential operator you type three

1769
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:17,670
right inside

1770
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:21,290
again for the model from the past probably still past separator

1771
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:24,460
in this case to great in ukraine you

1772
01:48:27,290 --> 01:48:30,960
so yeah in machine learning also quite often and have this minimisation problems and so

1773
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:33,710
one idea that he may be can

1774
01:48:33,730 --> 01:48:36,090
yes that's all that's why we think this

1775
01:48:36,130 --> 01:48:39,890
maybe weighted uses background of america methods

1776
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:41,600
coming from this

1777
01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:46,840
finite element ideas and partial differential like in machine learning as well

1778
01:48:46,850 --> 01:48:51,830
so if you minimize you can show that the same as

1779
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:58,950
find a function space which satisfies this relation for all the other systems based of

1780
01:48:58,950 --> 01:49:02,830
the city clerk in variational principle

1781
01:49:02,830 --> 01:49:05,870
and there's my lax milgram lemma one of

1782
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:06,960
is it

1783
01:49:06,970 --> 01:49:11,280
the results so if you have a certain conditions of the function space and f

1784
01:49:11,330 --> 01:49:16,530
of building up from is bounded sum obama from graph and really big techniques but

1785
01:49:17,570 --> 01:49:20,540
bounded from below in this regard so a u

1786
01:49:20,590 --> 01:49:22,320
founded by below

1787
01:49:22,330 --> 01:49:26,560
and you for your response from above and then the ethnic exist unique solution to

1788
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:32,330
two settings of the equivalent essentially and this is also called the weak solution to

1789
01:49:32,330 --> 01:49:34,850
the original partial differential equations

1790
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:39,520
because you need less conditions on the function u

1791
01:49:39,650 --> 01:49:42,060
if you look at the setting here

1792
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:46,120
let us break down here so you have the second derivative in each direction

1793
01:49:46,150 --> 01:49:48,140
so you admit you

1794
01:49:48,150 --> 01:49:50,080
to be twice differentiable

1795
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:56,330
but he unit you only once differentiable so much less

1796
01:49:56,380 --> 01:50:00,720
it's a different kind of function space in excess of the to big solution followed

1797
01:50:00,770 --> 01:50:04,390
settings you can show that some the same

1798
01:50:04,410 --> 01:50:09,350
and so this the setting we are mostly working

1799
01:50:09,450 --> 01:50:13,910
so before at some point always three since all of space was also

1800
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:20,910
and that results in really this could is with some finite dimensional subspace

1801
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,570
and now

1802
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:27,100
at the same setting as before the same being are from same right inside but

1803
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:31,260
now we're working in the finitary microsoft with the UN and we

1804
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:33,630
and solve this equation

1805
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:38,750
the same six six existence results hold

1806
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:41,210
and there's the CLM r

1807
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,980
again a feel take

1808
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,270
and you and you know solution to the continuous the discrete problem and then you

1809
01:50:48,270 --> 01:50:53,550
can show that see a difference so the error we make through it having the

1810
01:50:53,550 --> 01:50:57,530
error between the continuous and discrete solution is bounded

1811
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:01,520
the infimum over all functional discrete space

1812
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:08,290
distance to the continuous solution the CLM makes all the analysis of this stuff much

1813
01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:10,650
more easier because two

1814
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:13,890
the difference between the

1815
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:19,940
the discrete and discrete and continuous solution you just have to consider the approximation properties

1816
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:22,620
of the discrete function space

1817
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,530
if we can

1818
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:26,940
show some things

1819
01:51:26,970 --> 01:51:33,010
we can show how good discrete space can approximate any continuous space you know

1820
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:35,360
how good we are to the continuous solution

1821
01:51:35,370 --> 01:51:39,900
with some constant warfare

1822
01:51:39,910 --> 01:51:44,820
so what kind of function spaces are using these are

1823
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:49,770
the one-dimensional example these are the basis functions for so-called level three

1824
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:51,340
so this is

1825
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:53,570
one function which lies on the boundary

1826
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:56,270
so we always working on bounded domains domains

1827
01:51:56,490 --> 01:52:00,150
so this is one of the boundary for sex is another one

1828
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:03,900
this is the third one and so on and here again we have another one

1829
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:10,430
the the grand cross of the boundary and we are and have coefficients associated to

1830
01:52:10,430 --> 01:52:11,990
each of these basis functions

1831
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:15,180
a simple example for the interpolation problem

1832
01:52:15,190 --> 01:52:17,300
so skip the boundary functions

1833
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:19,470
and then we have level three surface

1834
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:25,050
again a hundred thousand to around the edges and another observation is that about eighty

1835
01:52:25,070 --> 01:52:30,920
percent of the edges are labeled with the plus and then the remaining twenty percent

1836
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:34,610
of labelled data mining OK so now what i want to do is i want

1837
01:52:34,610 --> 01:52:39,720
to sort of start reasoning or see how can be some kind of information about

1838
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:44,920
how how does the network construction these pluses and minuses how man on the underlying

1839
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:48,670
network and here sort of the basic the first piece of information that i could

1840
01:52:48,670 --> 01:52:53,150
use from social science it's called the theory of structural balance and this was done

1841
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:57,670
by hiding nineteen forty six and here is the reasoning he was talking about he

1842
01:52:57,670 --> 01:53:01,280
said if i have right he was saying a friend of a friend is my

1843
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:04,780
friend if i have a positive match someone and they have a positive action someone

1844
01:53:04,780 --> 01:53:07,150
else then that person is also likely

1845
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:11,050
then then i like to have a positive edge that person or enemy of my

1846
01:53:11,050 --> 01:53:14,820
enemy is my friend right or you could say my friends and is also like

1847
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:19,360
so statements what they that what to talk about is the talk about of connected

1848
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:23,670
nodes right so i can sort of translate into sort of graph theoretic terms and

1849
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:24,760
here here here

1850
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:27,920
they are right so a friend of a friend is my friend is this kind

1851
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:30,920
of structure that i have a friend who has a friend so you would like

1852
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:35,860
to be my friend right and this this case is the enemy of my enemy

1853
01:53:35,860 --> 01:53:39,530
is my friend or i could say my friends enemy is my friend

1854
01:53:39,530 --> 01:53:40,420
right so

1855
01:53:40,450 --> 01:53:42,400
and then

1856
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:44,550
so this prior

1857
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:50,700
sentences of this intrusion so called prior to balance right and then there are two

1858
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:52,820
other possible labelings of

1859
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:59,150
undirected triads with pluses and minuses that we will refer to as because they don't

1860
01:53:59,150 --> 01:54:03,050
correspond to this kind of information so this is the first one the way you

1861
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:06,530
can think about this one is to say i'm here i have two friends and

1862
01:54:06,530 --> 01:54:09,910
they don't like one right so this would be like some kind of unstable structure

1863
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:12,610
that it's very hard for me to

1864
01:54:12,630 --> 01:54:16,730
to have two friends and cannot you might have to go to get to work

1865
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:21,200
twenty together because they don't like one or this one here is that people of

1866
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:25,510
enemies and the idea was that sooner or later two of the enemy's will will

1867
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:29,360
form an alliance and go after the first one right so that is

1868
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:33,360
i don't think this is sort of how we can think about about signed just

1869
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:36,570
in this way here is a different way how we can think about this and

1870
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:41,320
this is what we refer to his status theory so here in the previous case

1871
01:54:41,610 --> 01:54:45,520
just one undirected so now we will think of it just as director and they

1872
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:50,570
say that if a gives positive edge to be this means that has higher standards

1873
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:54,470
than a OK m step this think of things to think of it as some

1874
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:55,200
kind of

1875
01:54:55,200 --> 01:55:01,110
soft intuitive notion of matter level of achievement or something so if a user plaster

1876
01:55:01,110 --> 01:55:05,340
means because higher status than a and it's the opposite is also true so a

1877
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:11,050
gives a negative edge to be dismissed because lovers that has the right and now

1878
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:12,780
this is another way

1879
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:16,630
so now based on the size of these edges i could again make predictions how

1880
01:55:16,650 --> 01:55:21,800
people will label one right and the important point is that the disappearance make different

1881
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:25,840
predictions so here is here is an example right so if i can i want

1882
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:30,800
to know what my intuition should be have about the design of the central repository

1883
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,220
were negative

1884
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:36,780
so the structural balance would say the enemy of my enemy is my friend so

1885
01:55:36,780 --> 01:55:40,990
that would put the blast here was that this was a of able say o

1886
01:55:41,010 --> 01:55:44,840
x because those that then i had access all because even though is that as

1887
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:48,920
the mean so it has the highest because he has the lowest so

1888
01:55:48,940 --> 01:55:52,610
if the edges pointing the direction of the status then here i should put the

1889
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:57,400
strike a higher status and this is what it can infer from this network structure

1890
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,050
here's is so

1891
01:56:00,070 --> 01:56:01,030
in this case

1892
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:03,880
special balance would say put the plus here

1893
01:56:04,510 --> 01:56:08,840
status theory would say put the minus here right so that all the explanations completely

1894
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:13,780
here in one of the examples where the same when the same thing happens when

1895
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:17,220
i what i did is i think the direction of the edges and every designed

1896
01:56:17,260 --> 01:56:18,840
so again then i would say

1897
01:56:18,860 --> 01:56:22,990
a friend of a friend is my friend status would say he has the lowest

1898
01:56:22,990 --> 01:56:28,260
at that has the highest and so is a relatively supports negative edge right in

1899
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:30,920
some other cases the

1900
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:32,610
so here is

1901
01:56:32,630 --> 01:56:36,950
what what do do not so what i'll do next is go into a sort

1902
01:56:36,950 --> 01:56:38,570
of devices

1903
01:56:38,570 --> 01:56:41,050
and experimental methodology how

1904
01:56:41,070 --> 01:56:46,150
how old how to tease apart how these two theories are expressed in the data

1905
01:56:46,150 --> 01:56:49,650
so how how much of status and how much of balance is going on in

1906
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:53,570
the data and then and then we will sort of look at the publication of

1907
01:56:53,570 --> 01:56:57,650
this very say OK can predict whether the people who befriends or and so can

1908
01:56:57,650 --> 01:57:02,360
predict the sign of that much OK so that's the plan for the for the

1909
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:06,090
next so here is the way the way we think about this so we will

1910
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:10,300
think about is the following we will think about our networks as director so well

1911
01:57:10,300 --> 01:57:15,060
our networks can direction i will tell you i trust you i label as a

1912
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:18,590
friend and now the question will be how many

1913
01:57:18,610 --> 01:57:19,670
how many

1914
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:24,450
triangles or how many such conclusions creations of just my network can be explained by

1915
01:57:24,450 --> 01:57:27,880
the theory of structure so the way i i think about this is to say

1916
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:35,200
half here in sixteen different possible ways of how to have our land to all

1917
01:57:35,610 --> 01:57:39,380
the same i right so so the idea is that the first this is to

1918
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:42,200
provide some kind of context and then the question is what is the sign of

1919
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:46,550
the red right and now i can go and whatever and of the sixteen possible

1920
01:57:46,550 --> 01:57:51,090
triads right y sixteen because i have tools for the direction he two possibilities for

1921
01:57:51,110 --> 01:57:55,760
direction here possibilities for direction here that's what i can put plus or minus here

1922
01:57:55,760 --> 01:58:00,090
put plus or minus that's two times three four four times forty sixty right so

1923
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:04,110
now i can go and labour and then just by what would the theory of

1924
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:07,260
structural balanced and so here i would say half friend of a friend is my

1925
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:10,720
friend so i with my prediction would be that you would a plus i could

1926
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:14,820
say half my friends enemy is my and i would put the miners then i

1927
01:58:14,820 --> 01:58:18,470
would say half a friend of a friend of my friend plus next one i

a couple of comments about the test you should get your test back yesterday and

1933
01:58:44,810 --> 01:58:50,360
here's the way things panned out class averages about 77

1934
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:56,600
I said settle down perhaps you think you've come to map physics this is 309

1935
01:58:56,600 --> 01:59:08,240
1 we have standards here so 77 class and the standard deviation was 17 and

1936
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:09,850
so you can say

1937
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:11,120
where things up

1938
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:18,240
lie 150 surpassed so congratulations a lot of people

1939
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:19,450
I put in the effort and

1940
01:59:20,540 --> 01:59:25,360
learning going on I was at the same time as I say congratulations I want

1941
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:31,280
to remind you that I think it comes as no surprise given the lateness of

1942
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:35,360
Labor Day this year that this 1st testing rather early and for many of you

1943
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:40,320
much of this material seen in high school and perhaps the data rate was a

1944
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:45,760
little bit faster than you're accustomed to but you have some familiarity please don't if

1945
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:53,660
you're appear become complacent because months from now will have another hour test and I

1946
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:59,590
think you still which your continuing to make the investment in time by if you're

1947
01:59:59,590 --> 02:00:04,900
down here as far as I want you to do is talk to somebody talk

1948
02:00:04,910 --> 02:00:10,400
to your recitation structure come and talk to me we will provide tutorial assistance at

1949
02:00:10,410 --> 02:00:17,560
no charge if you want to amplify the exposure to question-and-answer and all you have

1950
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:22,520
to do is contact with either hillary er lorry have my office and will arrange

1951
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:25,280
for a tutorial on meetings

1952
02:00:25,390 --> 02:00:29,530
and maybe down here you just get rattled maybe you are

1953
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:36,250
weren't feeling too well and they maybe have to bone on your test-taking skills but

1954
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:40,130
I don't care what what the score is down here at the at the moment

1955
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:46,190
Izard told you the 1st day I do look at trends in so let's just

1956
02:00:46,190 --> 02:00:51,280
make every effort to take the steps necessary to master the material and move forward

1957
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:54,910
the good news is that we're going to be shifting gears very soon and moving

1958
02:00:54,910 --> 02:00:59,000
into subject matter unlike anything seen in high school and so you'll get a fresh

1959
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:03,510
start so anybody feeling that if he or she is down here that it's it's

1960
02:01:03,510 --> 02:01:05,400
hopeless at this point it is not

1961
02:01:05,410 --> 02:01:11,780
quite the contrary and I've actually seen as evidence over the years mercifully not just

1962
02:01:11,780 --> 02:01:15,790
a small amount of evidence but there are in group like there's always a few

1963
02:01:15,790 --> 02:01:20,130
students who come in with a really strong background in high school is extremely well

1964
02:01:20,130 --> 02:01:24,500
in the 1st test conclude that chemistry in the bank and they can focus on

1965
02:01:24,500 --> 02:01:28,290
the other subjects and little by little they start creeping down here

1966
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:34,440
it happens so as the model solutions will be posted as as a told you

1967
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:38,850
in we pride ourselves in giving you a rapid return but there's a tradeoff that

1968
02:01:38,850 --> 02:01:44,720
is we're gonna make some mistakes mistakes not indelible you can come in and and

1969
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:50,590
have your grades adjusted the 1st thing you do please talk to your recitation instructor

1970
02:01:50,590 --> 02:01:56,950
recitation instructor feels that there was an oversight rather than the restoration structural recommend you

1971
02:01:56,950 --> 02:02:04,230
come see me and I will change the grade it just in addition recitation structure

1972
02:02:04,230 --> 02:02:09,750
has authority to make that adjustment and and you don't have to go stampeding down

1973
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:14,310
my office right away you can adjust those grades what's let's leave it alone was

1974
02:02:14,310 --> 02:02:19,570
there until next week and we can take a leisurely pace arm but there's no

1975
02:02:19,570 --> 02:02:24,440
time limit on and in fact you can be sitting 3 years from now

1976
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,350
waiting before commands

1977
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:32,130
and you can get that just I can adjust the grade right up until the

1978
02:02:32,130 --> 02:02:37,170
moment you get your degree after that the records are sealed so the reason I

1979
02:02:37,170 --> 02:02:40,780
tell you this is that I don't want people feeling that well

1980
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:45,180
you know that the 2 papers that start to decompose or something I don't get

1981
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:52,600
to him by 5 today don't build hurt yourself in the stampede in my office

1982
