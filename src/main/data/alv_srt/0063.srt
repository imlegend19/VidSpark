1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
on the right to have a good convergence properties we see that actually deals with

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,460
some things that this idea something from this weighted empirical measure is what makes particle

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,890
filters because that later

4
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,170
so to summarize the basic particle filtering

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,630
so as to approximate the collection of posterior distribution p of x one and given

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,960
y one you posted as follows

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,720
first time instance use all capital in particles according to the wire

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,450
then you weights those particles according to their likelihood with time warner

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,150
so that gives you an approximation of the stars which time one

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,390
because you want to obtain weighted sum up all you want some pool weighted evenly

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,620
to have the same weight

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,410
your so capital and times for you but the approximation of the

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,360
of the

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,630
so the solution to obtain new approximation which is

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,110
not purely measure

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,870
the following time index

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:08,650
following time index when you outside minus one you have capital particles approximate distributed according

18
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:14,430
to the distribution of time minus one use onboard extend each parse according to the

19
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,660
why the markov process you wait everybody to take into account basically the new acceleration

20
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,950
that does come about time that you do this particle approximation

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,100
of the target distribution from which are so-called capital in time to obtain new

22
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:38,620
approximation will become approximation was distribution so this is the bootstrap filter this is essentially

23
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,290
the key

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,840
garrison which was proposed in nineteen ninety three by golden silver missed

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,300
that's very simple sample resample

26
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,780
so what we obtain

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,390
so at each time and you obtain a

28
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,690
monte carlo approximation of the cell distribution

29
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,040
of ireland italy

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,690
actually can you also obtain at each time

31
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,820
you obtain an approximation of the marginal likelihood of interest on this is appeal byproduct

32
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,150
of the uris you get it all

33
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,390
this is the free lunch basically esteem gets you nothing

34
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,440
this is not a reason which is very easy to implement on show the computational

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,710
linear in the number of particles

36
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,220
the memory requirement in its most basic version

37
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,690
increases linearly with time because you need to store basically

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,890
the component x one selects on this capital and version of

39
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,340
if you are interested in approximating

40
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,940
not the joint distribution of x one xn given the observation that you're only interested

41
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:51,030
in computing the marginal distribution of the last component x and in y one and

42
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,470
then in this case the memory requirements do not increase with time index of for

43
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:02,130
all the talking application this is the subject you're interested so very simple algorithms

44
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,810
it's easy to analyse as well on foremost application actually more memory requirements also do

45
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,310
not increase over time so that's basically particle filters

46
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,340
only it seemed that essentially by using this

47
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:20,740
sampling or something mechanism we shape what we wanted to do that is we've come

48
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:28,200
multicellular mechanism to approximate those this sequence of it i'm unsure distribution

49
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,870
now i'm going to show you what i like to emphasise is that actually

50
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,320
we sort of part of the problem but we have haven't stumbled the pollen action

51
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,110
so let's have a look at what we call it to illustrate what coli what

52
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,710
happens basically when you're using particle filters

53
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,730
so the

54
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,850
i'm going to consider a a very simple example suggest look

55
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,610
basically to

56
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,780
the but some of the of the pictures

57
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,680
assume you are basically the particle physics

58
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:06,090
so what going to sample capital and particles according basically to the prior

59
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,960
on the most of the corresponds to the location of the particle x wanted i

60
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,570
so you've got capital out of

61
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,970
what you're doing is that those particles

62
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,590
we waited basically according to the like u-g-l-y y one given x one i think

63
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,380
they are related

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:31,700
the ones who got weighted approximate you waited empirical measure of your so called capital

65
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,610
in times from this weighted empirical measures

66
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,720
so articles are going to die

67
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,010
also article organ multiple of point OK

68
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,320
but that

69
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,940
is that time two

70
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,280
obviously you lost some confidence you

71
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:53,370
basically corresponding to the particle which have died at time one on some article about

72
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,890
multiple offspring

73
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:01,490
he basically each class correspond to what they could in the past space approximating the

74
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,970
joint distribution p of x one x two given y one y two

75
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,780
you reweights each of these parts according to the likelihood that time of the observation

76
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,550
to y two

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,360
you can sample on this weighted empirical measures some particles are going die some got

78
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,790
all going to springs

79
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,390
and you could possibly sway you move for a long

80
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:33,400
this is for example in this case the simple case the approximation you get

81
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,650
the posterior distribution

82
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,670
just the the distribution of the twenty fourth continent during the celebration of the twenty

83
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,550
the lognormal

84
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,810
and called at the cut point

85
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,780
and they say we have and one in ten thousand

86
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,140
chance of a false positive

87
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,120
you see ninety nine point nine nine

88
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,290
one minus

89
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,050
the is

90
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,310
that the data that they had for normals

91
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,810
hundred forty cases

92
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:12,000
none of which was bigger than the cut point because they had cut the tail of the distribution

93
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,230
so here's what they did in fact

94
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,310
they cut off the tail

95
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,290
and then said

96
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,090
it has a small tail

97
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,140
the sciences business

98
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,030
it is just one example

99
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,960
it pointed all i should i critical issue here

100
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,250
this was the penultimate version

101
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,170
that the eleventh hour

102
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,000
got spooked by the possibility

103
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,690
that was real actually

104
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,130
that water would sue them

105
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,290
for publishing this article

106
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,370
and so right at the eleventh hour

107
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,060
they trigger lack thereof of

108
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,370
one of the things i talk about in these

109
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,730
articles the prosecutor's fallacy

110
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,530
it is he hears what they do

111
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,150
they concluded

112
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,990
that if u have

113
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,990
he very small chance that something

114
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,260
that you must be

115
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,220
with probability one minus that's

116
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,640
so there are mixing up you know the inverting the conditional

117
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,630
and i explained that this you have to use bayes rule

118
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,070
to do then

119
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,510
if you want a really more about the prosecutors for fallacy

120
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,970
i google market can and the prosecutor's fallacy

121
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,150
will take you to

122
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,410
the new york times article

123
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,960
but by buchanan about

124
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,050
a woman named anna

125
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:49,850
the burke

126
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,230
from the netherlands who had the misfortune

127
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,000
being in

128
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,530
the operating room when lotsof patients died

129
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,960
she was tried

130
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,400
on the basis of

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,830
the rarity

132
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:07,930
i love

133
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,530
the confluence of all those things

134
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,640
and a very small probability that this was gonna happen and therefore she was guilty of

135
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,930
when i wrote this article

136
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,760
i cited

137
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,670
you can

138
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,410
andy editors and i wanna take out of

139
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:26,880
i so why

140
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,310
this is an elegant paper

141
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,900
he said that's the problem

142
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,230
he writes better than you do

143
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,050
if you wanna see something another elegant presentation google peter donnelly in ten conference and

144
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,580
he'll tell you about a similar case

145
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,720
um sally clark

146
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,660
in new came there was convicted

147
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,440
love killing two of her kids

148
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,630
who died in witnesses

149
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,040
sudden infant death syndrome and you can that called her death

150
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,450
and this doesn't happen

151
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,030
very often

152
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,680
and they calculated probability one in seventy

153
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,930
some million

154
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,810
that happens and therefore she's guilty

155
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,960
now my duty here's and this is where we don't even know there was a crime just like with

156
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,070
on a deeper

157
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,250
anyway dolly doesn't terrific job explaining this

158
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,140
should telling you how

159
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,680
eh pediatrician

160
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,100
we can

161
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,820
dim the lights on the blackboard again

162
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:39,040
and i will look at the slide

163
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,160
right so

164
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,920
if the tip is very far from the surface we give it kind of a

165
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,770
whitish color and as

166
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,580
closer and closer

167
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,680
the surface

168
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,700
we give it a darker and darker orangey color

169
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,520
and finally when it so far down here you actually

170
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,790
in content tunneling to the plan give it blue-collar

171
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,730
so that's how you get this image

172
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,190
the basis of this technique

173
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,720
so now you also notice that the seal molecules have a

174
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,280
peculiar arrangement

175
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,500
this is

176
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,560
not to do too

177
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,990
the most awkward

178
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,070
language intelligent design

179
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,220
this is due to a very

180
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,660
patient experimental i e graduate student

181
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,720
was that twenty four hours

182
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:48,080
putting the CEO molecules into this particular position

183
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,840
so how do you do that

184
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,500
he did it in the following way

185
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,070
the first

186
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,680
so if you see all molecules and put them anywhere on the surface to expose

187
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,880
the surface to some

188
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,780
and then he managed the surface to figure out where they were

189
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,830
and so if the seal molecules

190
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,080
or my balls at the bottom of the sea of molecules

191
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:20,570
in my foot here is the time to write just missed the surface right figure

192
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,320
out what they were doing your work

193
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,650
so that he's can move

194
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,270
c molecules

195
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,270
so it brings the ten

196
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,090
you know close to

197
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,590
one of the molecules

198
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,940
and then if you

199
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:41,320
but a voltage pulse and piezoelectric and actually shark that

200
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:46,070
well you can sure that that you get the feel molecule and it goes flying

201
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,230
that's nice but now we're going to go

202
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,470
well in order to find out how to do the whole sort of thing and

203
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,910
i find it somewhere all the way over here right now i really want over

204
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,360
the operation

205
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,920
and i well

206
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,390
twenty four hours later you get this little man

207
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,640
and i know it was twenty four hours later

208
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,360
all right so i

209
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:21,310
gonna be a while before this kind of nanotechnology assembling molecule by molecule

210
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,210
b for the system to be critical put a public ewels where you want them

211
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,930
all right

212
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,580
but some

213
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,020
even though

214
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,800
kind of visual observation of the atoms and molecules

215
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,560
it really wasn't possible

216
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,680
a hundred years ago

217
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,380
the evidence that i alluded to were quickly went through earlier

218
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,160
it was really quite compelling for the existence of a atom

219
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,620
and the

220
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,160
observation of the we

221
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,200
that was the most basic constituents of matter the elementary particles

222
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,620
you couldn't hear anything smaller than an atom

223
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,790
in fact at the end of the last century

224
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,990
it was generally believed

225
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,380
at the theoretical structure

226
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,900
of the universe was complete

227
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,070
nature was understood

228
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,620
there were no more

229
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,470
discoveries to be made and after all

230
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,580
there were by this time

231
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,860
in the late eighteen hundreds of a lot of the well tony mechanics had already

232
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,170
been known for two hundred fifty years mechanics that

233
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,330
guides the motion of all bodies around the human astronomical

234
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,700
thermodynamics was completely developed

235
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,250
the taxable mechanics was developed statistical mechanics which relate

236
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,880
the microscopic description of the behaviour of matter

237
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,070
to the macroscopic description

238
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,730
of the behaviour of matter

239
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:54,810
and also

240
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,390
there were these

241
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,540
i think six parents young presnell and her

242
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,070
seem to put to rest

243
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,690
the question of whether or not white was the particle or wave

244
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,680
all those experiments seem to be absolutely conclusive

245
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,390
light was a way

246
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:21,090
those experiments demonstrated maxwell's equations maxwell's equations used by

247
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,970
optics and electromagnetism

248
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,160
so i

249
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,290
you know by this time

250
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,380
there were was

251
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,840
all of these accomplishments idea was the

252
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,290
everything was done

253
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,610
the idea

254
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,800
was that the war the remains

255
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,630
was largely to investigate the next small point

256
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,080
everything else was done

257
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,460
however at the same time

258
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,270
by the

259
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,060
late eighteen hundreds

260
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:03,500
there began to be two sets of observations two tracks of observation

261
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,420
if you look closely

262
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,680
i began to illustrate that

263
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,080
things more

264
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,130
why so clear

265
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,610
maybe things were quite as well understood

266
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,210
what are those observations

267
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,890
well one of those observations is the discovery that we're going to start looking at

268
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,630
the atom is not

269
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,060
the most basic constituent

270
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,850
that you can take an animal park

271
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,470
into an electron

272
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,890
in the nucleus at least an electron and the nucleus

273
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,130
that's one track

274
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,120
the other track is

275
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,840
of prize as well for the most method with the most potential even if it

276
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,540
doesn't actually win at this stage of the competition

277
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,610
there's a number of simplifications in this challenge and and you might be able to

278
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,780
imagine a number of things which make it more realistic and maybe this is the

279
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:05,280
way of making sure the challenge rewards methods potential is that women future challenges which

280
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,460
make it harder which will reward those methods which are really got the long vision

281
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,460
here so the number of things we obviously we wouldn't know that because precisely we'd

282
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:20,780
measuring from stars galaxies may be more realistic and kernel may be more realistic in

283
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:26,640
many of many objects in each image maybe overlapping objects noise may be correlated between

284
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,180
a number of things satellite tracks cosmic rays think some of your thought about this

285
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,560
in a different astronomical context all

286
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,280
so practicalities

287
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:45,240
in the next two weeks we will present our description of this challenge

288
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,640
and that really summarizes in more detail what i've said in this talk

289
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,240
and with

290
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:58,460
now at the moment starting to produce the simulations with the research assistant that's fine

291
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,940
about ask out really really helpful and we're going to work on these simulations ourselves

292
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,400
make sure that it's not we're not waste your time with any bugs or any

293
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,540
we don't make it would make sure it's not too easy

294
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,240
and so we we all the time results online and we propose to run the

295
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,980
challenge for about six months starting in the middle of this year

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,260
after the end of the challenge we

297
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,220
make you the true inputs public and you're welcome to do what you like with

298
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:34,700
them and then write papers now all then all was this many you can great

299
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,460
so there's no kind of data rights issue here

300
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,730
i want to skip to asking you some questions in a minute so there's about

301
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,800
a hundred million galaxy images

302
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,410
just to summarise one galaxy per image all you have to do with dean is

303
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,660
deep involvement average here

304
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:00,580
and we're looking for an accuracy on this typical value point oh three and actually

305
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,280
about one percent

306
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,480
so they that to be able to do the future measurements that we we got

307
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,900
planned and the other that is the one equation you need to know

308
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:16,720
and you're very welcome to you we'd like we'd like your feedback during the challenge

309
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,400
and we'd like that to be a available to everybody so on this discussion forum

310
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,280
we have in cosmology and we've created a new section called the coffee we've created

311
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,800
a new section he scroll down you'll find section called great oh eight

312
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,720
which you can post your questions two

313
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,100
and it's also a nice section called understanding cosmology where you can send any basic

314
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,420
questions that you have on cosmology too you if you want and they can do

315
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,060
it anonymously which i find quite useful how OK

316
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,480
so i'd like to ask you some questions now so i'd like to see a

317
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,840
show of hands to get an idea of where we are this challenge so do

318
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,480
you think there's there's too much astronomy to learn to participate in this challenge

319
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,540
so hands up if you think yes

320
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,250
hands up if you think now

321
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,860
OK great well we certainly believe that's the case so this could looks promising OK

322
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,320
and this timeline we've got maybe starting in about five months' time and the challenge

323
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,600
running six months is this this timeline too short

324
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:32,880
so these things talk time is too short

325
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,480
and who thinks it's it's fine

326
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,250
and who thinks it's too long

327
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:48,840
we did debate making a one-year competition we thought that would be off-putting so OK

328
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:56,060
great so my final final question really and some responding really to what michelle said

329
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,150
of my KVL KCL method

330
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:03,290
i need to write down all my element relationships so before i do that that

331
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,090
we go ahead and label all the pages and currents that are unknowns in the

332
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,970
the the label

333
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,590
what it is and currents associated with source

334
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
as you

335
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,490
notice i continue to follow this convention

336
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,740
where whenever i label voltages and currents for an element

337
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,880
i will show the current going into the positive terminal of the of the element

338
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,190
after element very low voltage

339
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,440
so so you have been not nine

340
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:43,970
let me let me pause for five seconds and show you a point of confusion

341
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,700
that happens sometimes

342
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,040
often don't confuse between

343
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:53,300
what is called the elements of the variable associated with the element was is the

344
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:59,660
element values OK notice that capital be not is the voltage that this what source

345
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,370
while this

346
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,580
name here

347
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,340
you not is simply a variable that is used to label the voltage across the

348
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,690
so so only i can labels

349
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,090
he won the world department store

350
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,200
and i one the current flowing through the resistor

351
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,950
so this method of labeling

352
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,590
where i

353
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,590
follow the convention

354
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:31,380
the current flows into the positive terminal is called the associated variables discipline

355
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:43,940
now to argue the what discipline in situations where you have the choice

356
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,730
OK of an idea of

357
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,480
well possible choices you pick one as a convention OK so here

358
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:58,120
the convention we use associated variables discipline and then use that method to consistently labelled

359
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,360
the unknown voltages and currents in our circuits

360
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,250
OK so let me continue the labeling

361
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,880
i four

362
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,830
i three

363
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,460
we three here and

364
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,700
the two

365
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,430
and i two

366
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,480
v five

367
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,970
and i five i think that's it

368
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,050
so go ahead and labelled all my unknowns

369
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,680
these are the voltages and currents are the voltages and currents associated with each of

370
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,590
the elements

371
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,720
and my goal is to is to solve for these

372
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,990
in terms of

373
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,620
in terms of our solution here

374
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,590
let's follow the method outlined for you

375
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,410
so the first step

376
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,000
i'm simply going to go ahead and write down all the elements b i

377
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,850
relationships OK so the first step

378
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,150
i'm going to write down onto the relationships

379
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,890
so what

380
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,430
can someone allowed for me

381
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,940
the relationship for people that source

382
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,720
OK good

383
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,140
so we be zero is the capital of you know that is that

384
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:21,630
the very moving on is simply equal to the voltage

385
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,570
similarly i can like the others

386
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,530
v one is either one or one

387
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,390
we need to do is i two r two and so on

388
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,180
OK and have one two three four five six elements so i will get

389
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,650
six such equations

390
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,450
step two

391
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,380
i'm going go ahead and write KCL

392
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,870
kcl for the nodes in my in my system

393
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:53,300
and so that we start with node a

394
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:57,120
so four a i get

395
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,410
let me take this all the current swing out of the node

396
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,050
so i get

397
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,330
i not flowing out

398
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,460
i one

399
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,920
flowing out

400
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:12,940
plus i for flying and we must sum to zero

401
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,410
OK for

402
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,540
then i can go ahead and do the other nodes let's say for example i

403
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,630
do know be

404
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,760
four node b

405
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,060
i have

406
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,660
i two going out

407
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,740
that's positive

408
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,510
i three

409
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:33,170
and i i one is coming in so i give my i want equals zero

410
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,620
OK so i have

411
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,960
one two three

412
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,490
four nodes

413
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,670
OK so i i would get four equations

414
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,830
OK it turns out that the fourth equation

415
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:51,080
is not independent you can derive it from the others so i can be independent

416
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,730
equations of this

417
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,220
i can then write KVL

418
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:02,130
and for KVL i just go around my lips here

419
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,210
and that we go through the

420
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,650
this first loop here

421
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,850
in this manner

422
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,040
OK and so the trick that i use

423
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,350
just to be incredibly careful when you go through this into the neuron minus and

424
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,560
plus is correct

425
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,830
because otherwise you can get

426
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,790
come up with an

427
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:27,270
uncertainty which is this is sometimes called an error in the measurement really so

428
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,690
and the way you find the answer is

429
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,320
that you have to read

430
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,370
used to practice here

431
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,950
you get the largest value possibly could never get a larger value

432
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,940
you'll find that you get two point zero zero six

433
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
i would say

434
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,710
the answer is then

435
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,180
there is a reason

436
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,240
this is the dimension number

437
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,240
because it's

438
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,850
length divided by length

439
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,740
the time t one

440
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,960
divided by

441
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,260
would be the square root of one divided by

442
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,730
that is the

443
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,370
mention that this is an argument that we have there

444
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,450
and we find if we take the square root of the number

445
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,980
o five one point four one four

446
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,310
was minus o point

447
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,540
o thing

448
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,390
so here

449
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,150
is a firm prediction

450
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,730
this is a prediction

451
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,790
we're going to make

452
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,740
we're going to

453
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,550
measure thirty one

454
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,250
and they're going to be a number

455
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,670
and then we're going to measure q two

456
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,620
not going to be you know

457
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,230
i have done this experiment ten times

458
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,570
and the numbers always reproduced within about one millisecond

459
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,980
so i could just adopt an uncertainty one millisecond i want to be a little

460
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,950
bit on the safe side occasionally deflected by two seconds

461
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,300
let's be conservative

462
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,490
and that's assuming

463
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,770
i can measure

464
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,490
an accuracy

465
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,560
of about

466
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,190
two minutes

467
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,140
that's really state

468
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,480
we can measure these times

469
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,730
and then

470
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,730
we can take the ratio

471
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,930
and then we can see

472
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,310
at the time it takes for small

473
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,650
the height

474
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,940
very high

475
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,460
i will make it a little

476
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:37,920
one of the what we would like to all

477
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,770
all right

478
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,700
we have set up here

479
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,710
we first do the experiments with the

480
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,870
three years

481
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,190
see this year

482
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,970
and the time

483
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,020
the moment i pull the strings

484
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,330
contact with local start

485
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,590
the moment hits four

486
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,980
otherwise at all

487
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,760
OK but i'm really

488
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,330
everything that

489
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,990
it lies the i

490
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,950
seven hundred eighty one

491
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,880
so this number

492
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:40,000
it down because you need for your second sign

493
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,500
seven hundred eighty one millisecond was uncertainty of many

494
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,980
ready for the second one

495
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,410
OK nothing wrong

496
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:01,190
in ready

497
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,550
zero right

498
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,940
thank you

499
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,070
one zero

500
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,480
five hundred and and fifty one

501
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,150
nervous because i

502
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,700
i hope that

503
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,030
is it works

504
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,980
so i take my

505
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,350
and i'm not going to

506
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,050
the ratio

507
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,480
you can find by adding the two years

508
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,770
and the CDC study bacteria in nineteen seventy eight looked at the incidence of measles

509
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:50,800
in both states that enforce the laws versus those that did not

510
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,470
and as you can see

511
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,420
you had a ten fold difference in the incidence of measles so in fact mandates

512
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,510
were effective

513
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,360
achieving high levels of immunization

514
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:10,030
ending outbreaks of measles

515
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:16,600
well we have had a growth in the number of kids parents choosing to exempt

516
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,730
their children from

517
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,940
and there are

518
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:28,580
important risks that those kids are exposed to

519
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,340
exemptors are much more likely to get measles

520
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,750
and there are more likely to get whooping cough

521
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,330
perhaps even more important

522
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:47,000
vaccinated no vaccine is percent effective some people who get the vaccine or not but

523
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,450
they assume that they are

524
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,600
and there are also individuals in the community who can be in

525
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,290
because of medical conditions

526
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,170
among the vaccine for years

527
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,810
about one percent

528
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,740
vaccinated children actually acquired

529
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,510
they're measles cases in an outbreak

530
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,140
from an example to

531
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,380
so exemptors are in fact spreaders

532
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:16,490
who in parallel health of others in the community

533
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,180
now let's look at where we are nationally

534
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,400
there are three kinds of exemptions

535
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,140
this state immunization was

536
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,970
medical exemptions

537
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,200
religious exemptions

538
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,330
so called philosophical or personal choice exemptions

539
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,630
and the green states here

540
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,470
i have

541
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,090
philosophical personal choice

542
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,950
or if you want to be british or australian conscientious objectors

543
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:54,150
and keep in mind where those states are also show you the next slide

544
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,190
which is the

545
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,810
rate of immunisation exemptions

546
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,200
across the country and just go back

547
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,510
you can see that it's most of the highest rates of exemptions are in the

548
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,960
in the areas of the country there are

549
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,520
philosophical exemptions allowed

550
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:20,010
and washington state as you may notice my state leads the nation

551
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:24,660
perhaps why have been focusing on this issue for

552
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,300
this is a map of washington state

553
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,490
that shows the counties

554
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,420
and the colors of red here

555
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,360
designated counties that have greater than five percent of kids

556
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,730
and then to spend one extra second year y

557
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,640
i think the five percent number

558
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,790
if you have a school

559
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,860
in which

560
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,910
ninety five percent of the kids are immunized against measles

561
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,690
and five percent are not

562
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,960
and measles gets into that school schools

563
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,250
it will do all it can do which is typical of susceptible

564
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:12,490
five percent is a high enough rate and susceptibility to sustain measles outbreak in a

565
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,130
closed environment like schools

566
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,530
so here's where we were in nineteen

567
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,030
ninety nine

568
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,670
and the doctor by the way is greater than ten percent exemptions

569
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,020
and here is where we are today

570
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,470
now if you ask me what are the reasons for exemptions

571
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,520
the short answer is i don't know

572
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,000
our belief

573
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:42,540
based on some interviews and experience the belief of

574
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:47,040
people who work in public health in my community is that the reasons vary in

575
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,850
different parts of our state in parts of our state these are people who have

576
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,500
major concerns about vaccine safety

577
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:02,520
i have an alternative lifestyle in other areas of the state is individuals who have

578
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,130
a civil libertarian view

579
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:10,680
and object to the state requires irrespective of the medical issues involved

580
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:16,040
so let's look what's happened to the US and this is measles cases from last

581
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:21,430
the first thing you should notice by this slide is cross hatching

582
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:26,880
and all of the cross patch areas are immunized so the vast majority of the

583
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,540
measles cases are heard in people who were unimmunized

584
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,170
and next focus on the colours

585
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,750
the orange half

586
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,500
are individuals were unimmunized by choice

587
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,190
they opted out

588
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,540
so half the measles cases essentially of last year

589
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,200
or duty individuals who had opted out

590
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,800
much more concerning is this slide in this slide is a little complicated so i'm

591
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:57,200
going to go through it somewhat slowly the red line shows you

592
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,760
the total number of imported measles cases each year

593
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,800
the blue

594
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,900
bars are imported cases

595
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:13,670
the yellow bars are cases that occur within the country as a result of importations

596
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,240
so look at the two thousand eight bar and what you see

597
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:18,990
it is

598
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,340
that measles spread

599
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,450
two of far greater extent in two thousand eight

600
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,230
of course we have

601
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,370
the first

602
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,620
then we can

603
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:52,540
but it be

604
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:15,870
he was

605
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:38,670
well the

606
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:15,160
well i mean

607
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,970
just me

608
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:58,140
you know

609
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,180
cdc four

610
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,110
the problem

611
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,470
we he

612
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:14,830
it was

613
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,370
so what

614
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:45,920
from you

615
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:40,620
all o

616
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,440
what what

617
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:05,770
there are right this is what you want

618
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:23,600
so the

619
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:45,150
i'll summarize

620
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:50,350
like what we want

621
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:55,520
you might like a

622
00:45:55,550 --> 00:46:13,420
well let's you have to do

623
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:16,200
it was

624
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,000
but more

625
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,770
the other role some finite number

626
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:26,200
where the integral is infinite

627
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,980
it's never undefined

628
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,600
it's always defined

629
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,350
i think that's need

630
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:38,270
a few people don't think it's needed

631
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:43,580
too bad

632
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,830
now i guess i guess what i was first starting this i don't think was

633
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,430
maybe either because it was too complicated

634
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,270
so you have an excuse

635
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:56,370
if you think about it for a while and you understand that and you don't

636
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,410
think it's the

637
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,410
then i think you have a real problem

638
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:03,910
so now

639
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:13,310
i did this

640
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:18,620
getting too many slides here

641
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,310
here we go

642
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,720
here's something new

643
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,640
by the looks no

644
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,910
let's look at the function now

645
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:31,390
just defined on the interval zero to one

646
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:38,290
suppose that h two a is equal to one for each rational number

647
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:42,930
and it's zero for each irrational number

648
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:48,310
OK in other words this is the function which

649
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:51,720
which looks absolutely wild

650
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,180
just goes up to here

651
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,680
and this one

652
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,810
or zero

653
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:05,640
and this one of these at this dense set of points

654
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,680
which we've already said doesn't amount to anything

655
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,390
and it's zero everywhere else

656
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:15,810
now you put that into the ring line integral

657
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:18,270
and the minor road goes crazy

658
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:21,480
because no matter how small i make this interval

659
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,140
there are an infinite number of

660
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,700
rational numbers in that interval

661
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,980
and therefore the reminded broken never even get started

662
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,680
for the love began to grow

663
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,620
on the other hand look at what happens now we have a bunch of points

664
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,700
which are sitting in one

665
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:42,520
we have a bunch of points which are sitting at zero the only thing we

666
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,980
have to do is evaluate the measure

667
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,200
of the set of points which are up in some tiny intervals

668
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:52,770
i've been here

669
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:54,600
what's this measure

670
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:59,370
the set of tees corresponding to the rational numbers

671
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,290
we already said that was zero

672
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:06,870
now that's why the big integration works

673
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:10,290
any countable set

674
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:15,140
and in fact any these uncountable sets of measure zero

675
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,080
get lost in here

676
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,870
because you're combining them all together and you say

677
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:25,390
they don't contribute to the integral at all

678
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:28,470
that's why the big integration is so simple

679
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:35,140
you can forget about all that stuff

680
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,160
when we look the last time

681
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,180
that the fourier series

682
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,410
four a

683
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,250
four square wave

684
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:44,250
and remember we found that

685
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,040
everything behave very nicely

686
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:50,970
except where the square wave had this continuity

687
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:55,770
the fourier series converges to the mid point

688
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:58,250
and that was kind of awkward

689
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:03,410
the midpoints where the function is discontinuous

690
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,980
don't amount to anything

691
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,000
because in that case there just too often there are only two points

692
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,830
measure zero just what is the what

693
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:20,640
you all felt intuitively when you saw that example that those points were not important

694
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,200
he felt that this was mathematical carpet

695
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:27,310
well the bank felt was mathematical carpenter

696
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:30,220
but he went one step further and he said here's the way of getting rid

697
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,140
is independent of z

698
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,670
given y

699
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,860
what do i mean by that i mean the following the for the family of

700
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:46,230
distributions whose joint distribution factorizes according to the graph is it the case that every

701
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:50,530
such distribution must satisfy the property

702
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,090
that's what i mean

703
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,950
so if you think about it this way

704
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:59,150
imagine i had distribution in which all the variables are independent i just constructed distribution

705
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:00,180
by taking the

706
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,320
defining marginal distributions for every variable and the joint is the product of the marginal

707
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:08,910
so by construction all the variables are independent every conditional independence property you can think

708
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:15,790
of necessarily holds for the distribution of everything just independent everything else

709
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,890
i can describe such a distribution by this graph it would be consistent with this

710
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:24,430
graph because this graph which specifies certain conditional independence properties and it would certainly be

711
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:27,320
true my particular distribution

712
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,080
what is not

713
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,970
what is not the case this

714
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:36,750
what is the case for this particular test is that every possible distribution described by

715
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,470
that graph that satisfy the property

716
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:49,820
i could have the conditional independence property which holds by virtue of the particular numerical

717
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:55,160
values are chosen for my distribution but i might describe this this joint distribution due

718
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,000
to the graph which has lots of links and so all its conditional independence properties

719
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,550
are not fully visible to you

720
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:03,740
it makes sense

721
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,520
put another way

722
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:09,080
i fully connected graph describes any distribution

723
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,530
but but equally vacuous

724
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,090
and that's an important point to come back and discuss

725
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:20,440
a very easy way to see what i mean by that in minute to return

726
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,530
to that

727
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:23,580
o one

728
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,410
yes especially if it's a fully connected graph

729
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:39,860
its undirected then is only one clique which is the set of all nodes are

730
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,990
just says define any function over the variables you like so long as it is

731
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:48,300
nonnegative normalized to one is completely general distribution

732
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:53,300
so is it the case that any distribution which factorizes according to this graph satisfies

733
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,450
the conditional independence property and yes it is and the test is very simple and

734
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:03,300
a graphical test we simply test whether the conditioning variables associated here

735
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,740
the variables of interest x and z in this case and they do what i

736
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,050
mean by that is every path

737
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:14,420
from any node in the set z to any node in the set x

738
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:20,600
any path is blocked every path is blocked by one of the observed noticeable think

739
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,830
about imagine trying to get from x to z

740
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:29,270
well you can't do it because every node is observed to think observed nodes blocking

741
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,290
and i think you can see

742
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,550
hopefully you can see why this is

743
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:42,430
the joint distribution of all everything

744
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:53,890
the product of cliques a function of the variables in that claim

745
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,700
two nodes which

746
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,960
which don't have a direct connection between them so let's take this note here in

747
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,420
this note here there no direct path between them so they can't belong to the

748
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,020
same clique

749
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:16,000
so in terms of the variables x and z

750
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:22,250
to be very complicated involving followed factors and all these factors which involve variables in

751
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:26,520
a lot of these and other factors which involve variables in z

752
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,090
and the lots of other factors

753
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,320
but x

754
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:35,670
this note here and this note here can't both appear in the same factor

755
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:36,930
and therefore

756
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,680
when we condition on y

757
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:41,340
this must be this must take the form

758
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:45,860
some function of x times some another function of z

759
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,380
time some other stuff but so far as x and z are concerned

760
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:52,140
and so what i normalize it

761
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:54,710
i have the property that p of x

762
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:56,490
and said given y

763
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,100
this p of x given y

764
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,320
he is a given

765
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,300
which is why conditional independence property

766
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:08,460
so in other words

767
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:10,750
the graph specifies factorizations

768
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,580
we can use the graph to test for conditional independence properties in the case of

769
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:18,650
the undirected graph the test is very simple we test the graph separation so way

770
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:19,950
to think of that

771
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:24,630
is to think of looking for every path from every node in one set to

772
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:28,790
every node in another set and asking whether that path is blocked by an observed

773
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:35,520
is blocked for every path that conditional independence property must hold if there exists

774
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,040
even one part which is unblocked

775
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:41,690
that conditional independence property doesn't necessarily hold

776
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:46,290
it might hold for the particular numerical values that you have your joint distribution but

777
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:50,630
it doesn't necessarily holds for every member of the family of distributions described by the

778
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:02,480
so just to say that again in

779
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,760
and in the course of the the same idea but from a different way

780
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:10,870
we can think of the graph is the fields

781
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,060
so here's a graph

782
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:16,040
a directed graph and how some of the variables are observed in this case

783
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:17,980
and imagine

784
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:19,990
we consider

785
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,040
so x here is the set of all variables described by the graph

786
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:32,280
imagine we consider every possible distribution every possible joint distribution over those variables

787
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,630
and we ask

788
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:37,300
it does not can that joint distribution be written

789
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:41,990
as a product of factors consistent with this particular graph

790
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,370
if it can be passed passes through the filter if it can't get blocked

791
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:50,050
so in general we have on the right-hand side of the filter is the smallest

792
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:52,530
set of distributions on the left-hand side

793
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:56,950
we can do the same thing again we can take the set of all distributions

794
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:58,960
very distribution we can say

795
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:03,580
does satisfy the conditional independence properties specified by this graph

796
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:04,710
so is this

797
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:07,110
independent of this given those two

798
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,800
which graphs says must be the case

799
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:15,380
if the joint distribution satisfies all the conditional independence properties required by the graph and

800
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:17,380
its line through one to the other side

801
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,720
and if not it isn't so that these two families the theorem to prove theorems

802
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:27,050
but if you want i recommend lawrence's book for elegant proofs then the theorem is

803
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:32,010
that given the definitions i've given you factorisation conditional independence for undirected graph those two

804
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:34,490
families of the same

805
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:39,120
there's this little technicality about if the distribution is strictly zero somewhere in this little

806
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,730
subtlety is not quite true

807
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:46,530
total discounted that special case

808
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,390
so the

809
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:58,910
the joint distribution distribution here which factorizes into product of marginals will go through every

810
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:04,270
and the weight of such a payload of our telescope was about a thousand kilograms

811
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:07,060
these balloons would go up two hundred forty thousand feet

812
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,610
and they were used there about five hundred feet across also use

813
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,010
pictures of them very shortly

814
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,470
it was a risky business in that

815
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,010
no guarantee of success

816
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,170
you want to be known

817
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,990
if they were so much the better

818
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,840
if they didn't work tough luck

819
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:24,030
there was just no way

820
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:28,540
that you could recover the money they were very thin balloons made

821
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,350
of polyethylene

822
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:34,660
and the thickness of the body was better than cigarettes

823
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:37,260
so you can imagine how easy it is to damage them

824
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,360
and if you don't damage them during the launch

825
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:42,150
it's easy to damage them on the way up

826
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,780
due to the jet stream

827
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:44,970
and the

828
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:47,200
very cold layers of air

829
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,640
that you have trouble pos

830
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,960
so i would like to

831
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,640
so you know some slides

832
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:55,230
and then we will get back to

833
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,780
talking a little bit more about

834
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:18,180
x-ray astronomy

835
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,640
all right

836
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:27,180
so let's see what we have first

837
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,720
you see here of my undergraduate students

838
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,150
at the time they were undergraduates student now they are both phd's

839
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:40,200
some of you may think that science doesn't have much romance but

840
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:42,210
there's a lot of merit

841
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,660
and they have kids

842
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,850
this is bad only

843
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,970
still very important in working with me on it

844
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,200
and this is jim

845
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:58,010
they're working on the electronic which is enormously

846
00:59:58,050 --> 00:59:59,590
tedious task

847
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,210
the wiring of the

848
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:07,660
you see the plant in texas where these balloons were built

849
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,980
these were extremely long holes as you can imagine

850
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:12,120
and here the

851
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,890
the goal of the balloon which i like

852
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,210
pieces that you see in the tangerine on the surface of the tangerine they were

853
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:20,390
sealed together with its

854
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:23,040
and only women were allowed to do this work

855
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:29,370
because it was well known that men are too impatient and make many more mistakes

856
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:33,380
so only women were allowed there was nothing to do with discrimination but simply because

857
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:38,320
women were better doing this work

858
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:42,430
here balloon comes out of the box is a picture i took in texas

859
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,070
where we launched balloons from

860
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,040
nicely covered with this being sheet

861
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,960
and we have this

862
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,910
huge cloth on the on the grass

863
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,560
because the balloon is so thin that if you would put it on the grass

864
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:55,630
it would

865
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:59,340
to demonstrate way i told the skin is about

866
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,370
know then

867
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:03,310
cigarette papers carefully taken out

868
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,500
we inspected closely

869
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:08,790
and in this case there was some concern

870
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:11,070
that might be holding in the balloon

871
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,210
in fact it wasn't leased the hole in the thing covered

872
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:17,590
and so we carefully inspected whether the whole

873
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:22,360
propagated deeper and i wasn't too worried because this was not my balloon

874
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,930
it's always said you can see some of your colleagues

875
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:29,650
having a balloon that

876
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:32,840
doesn't get up

877
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:34,550
and i'm taking you to

878
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,570
the desert town in australia

879
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:39,030
central australia alice springs

880
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,650
i've learned many balloons from alice springs

881
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,330
now you get a pretty good idea of what the launch is going to be

882
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:46,360
like here is the launch track

883
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:48,730
the telescope is on the launch track

884
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:51,250
all of this is anti balloon

885
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,490
and here's is what we call the roll or

886
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:56,270
holds the balloon down and only this part of the world is going to be

887
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:58,390
inflated his the track

888
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,340
the UID inflation two

889
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,040
so which reinflate

890
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:08,250
it takes place almost always early morning

891
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,870
near sunset in the evening because that's when the wind is very calm and we

892
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,190
need very calm conditions

893
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:18,480
it is this part of the balloon is going to be inflated

894
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:20,950
and so it is going to be a huge force

895
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:24,550
the buoyant force i hope you'll remember q made law

896
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:29,390
of several thousands of kilograms force up and so this vehicle here

897
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:32,640
weighs about four five tons to hold it down

898
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:36,160
and when we launched the balloon we actually released his arm we flip these are

899
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:38,420
so you will see that

900
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:39,750
how to bloom

901
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:44,190
will make it on the way up

902
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:46,650
so this is alice springs australia again

903
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:51,530
sun is rising and we started inflation CUDA inflation tubes

904
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:54,810
and report the helium in the balloon it's this is

905
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:57,460
very critical phase of the launch

906
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,870
because if there is a little bit of side wind

907
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,690
and the blue touches the ground

908
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,090
and it's all over it just

909
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,310
it's damaged

910
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:09,400
you bought you don't even continue

911
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:12,800
this is a little later when they we call this the bubble

912
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:13,990
this is

913
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,280
the role are here and this is all these anti balloon new direction

914
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,950
and this part is only some eighty feet high so

915
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:25,440
you see these cause that i told you about earlier

916
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:28,530
this is all these tedious work that is done by these women who sealed these

917
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,050
course together

918
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,870
they all come together near apex

919
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,540
the big one

920
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:42,160
all right now you see the situation from the launch struck site

921
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:42,550
for this

922
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,510
reflection here is thirty seven degrees

923
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:50,390
it's a little bit different for rapid former very close to thirty seven

924
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:55,030
if you calculate multi angle uris

925
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:56,600
in the case

926
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:57,930
that we see the rainbow

927
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,260
you will find that i six degrees i mentioned earlier

928
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:07,240
and are is roughly forty degrees that means you're only three degrees away from the proof strength

929
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:12,120
and that means that the light that comes in he that is unpolarized that enters

930
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:17,200
the range still unpolarized when it comes back at this point it's almost a hundred

931
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:23,260
per cent polarized by electric vector is oscillating perpendicular to the blackboard so standing like

932
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:24,930
this it's polarized like this

933
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,930
but of course since we're dealing with an arc

934
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:31,740
i think the whole thing is actual symmetric remembered at

935
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,490
it's all right you like so

936
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,660
and it's all right here like so

937
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,550
and it's polarized helix

938
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:39,720
and the reason is

939
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,030
that's the balancing the reflection in the back

940
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:44,640
it's very very close

941
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,370
to the brewster angle

942
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:49,570
i like to

943
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:50,890
walk on the beach

944
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,870
and plum island is one of my favourite beaches

945
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:55,910
and i have

946
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:57,660
is occasions

947
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,300
look at the waves coming in water splashing up

948
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:03,680
this beautiful water drop

949
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:07,990
and then she whispered you see a rainbow in this war

950
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:09,910
the sun is there

951
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:11,870
the location of plum island

952
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:16,030
looking always in east and then you watch again for another wave to come in

953
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,780
wave comes in water splashes up first

954
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:20,970
rainbow and it's gone and so i was there

955
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,680
three years ago with my friend bill produced

956
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:25,260
also physicist

957
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,870
and i thought without insulting below one point out to him that

958
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,220
if you look at the right moment that the right direction you see

959
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:36,140
and so

960
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:37,850
back and the way in which

961
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:41,160
what is biceps rainbow i said they look it

962
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,120
look so that

963
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:44,590
this is nothing

964
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:48,300
and no one comes up she's beautiful rainbow gone

965
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:49,830
we'll see nothing

966
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:53,680
but only irritated with bill because it looks all

967
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:57,570
class some people just don't wanna see things right the middle of

968
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,450
and one

969
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:01,890
i look real

970
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,640
and i notice he was wearing sunglasses

971
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:08,200
and the sunglasses that you buy in the store

972
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:15,700
this is the direction of polarization of polarized sunglasses

973
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:16,680
and so

974
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,510
poor bill was killing

975
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:20,700
the light that came back

976
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,100
you're probably looking at this part of the rainbow

977
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:24,450
and his sunglasses

978
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:27,010
polarized light in this election so you wouldn't see

979
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:31,660
thirty billion ever not wear sunglasses he says location is that take them all

980
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:33,300
put them off and he said

981
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:34,570
i see the rainbow

982
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,620
that's the proof that the rainbow polarized

983
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:41,430
so now i want to

984
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,760
something that you may think is a rainbow

985
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:49,570
but it

986
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:53,550
and since i don't want to mislead u which students for that matter

987
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:56,120
i want you to appreciate what you're going to see

988
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,200
going to think you see a rainbow

989
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,700
but it's almost a rainbow but not quite

990
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,470
i've one drop of water

991
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:07,700
units this

992
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:09,370
in the glass

993
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,760
and that's my one drop water

994
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:18,850
and i'm going to shine an enormously bright dream of life right at

995
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,240
that's going to be very unpleasant through

996
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:25,140
but looking straight into the sun

997
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:26,120
don't worry

998
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,430
but there's something about

999
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:30,100
now you won't see you won't see some

1000
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,550
so what comes back

1001
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:36,760
from that one range of if i look at the long range

1002
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,280
this cone of light will come back

1003
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:40,760
in my direction

1004
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:42,620
so there will be

1005
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:45,180
a read outside of the cone

1006
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,200
gradually turning to blue

1007
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:49,470
inside white white light

1008
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:51,200
this white light

1009
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:55,220
and i'm going to project on screen

1010
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,850
and that's what i'm going to show you

1011
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,760
so it's not the rainbow but it has everything in it

1012
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:02,120
that explains the

1013
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,390
and that's the red light the polarized

1014
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:10,430
because the red line is the result of a balancing of inside the water

1015
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:12,240
at very close to the everything

1016
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,120
now you may think that's why handed out to polarizes

1017
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,180
wrong physics again

1018
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,990
because once the light bounces off the screen

1019
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:27,910
no longer polarized is only polarized but i am i'm in a privileged position for me is polarized

1020
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:29,890
what i can do and will do

1021
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,640
i will hold polarimeter

1022
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:34,510
in the being so that you will see that i can actually

1023
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:36,550
show the direction of polarization

1024
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,280
so we first have to lower the screen

1025
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,600
and then you eyes have to adjust to the doctors

1026
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,600
don't put your hopes to high you're not going to see

1027
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:51,390
will include white collars

1028
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:55,300
i have only one one draw have headmaster with me

1029
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:56,450
one one

1030
01:08:57,870 --> 01:08:58,970
so would you hold to

1031
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:03,990
that's why i said to adjust the doctors suppose

1032
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:12,490
so relaxed

1033
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,180
try to enjoy it

1034
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:20,350
take thirty second's for your eyes together little used to be

1035
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:22,320
darkness and then

1036
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:25,450
you will see the intersection of the screen

1037
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,330
cone of light

1038
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:29,620
is produced by

1039
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,350
one wonderful

1040
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:50,120
there you have it

1041
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:51,760
and i'm going to look for my

1042
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:54,050
polarizing okay

1043
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:55,780
so let's agree

1044
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:58,890
what you see unmistakable

1045
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,260
you'll see first that around outside in the blue mountains

1046
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:06,350
and you see white like here

1047
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:08,990
you understand where that comes from

1048
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:13,950
that's again reflected light in the back of the raindrop but all the colors are

1049
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:17,830
superimposed on each other and you stupid waste very little white lie they don't know

1050
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:20,370
cross was why rules

1051
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:27,620
because the of

1052
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,830
to me

1053
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:32,630
mine tuning than half

1054
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:34,870
i x zoom

1055
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,470
the a simple case that the

1056
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,880
the vector only exist in the x direction

1057
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:46,310
so it has a certain amplitude i call it is zero x

1058
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:50,120
and i make it traveling wave of course cosine omega t

1059
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:52,880
minus case

1060
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:55,450
so EY

1061
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:59,530
and easy

1062
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:02,190
only a factor in the

1063
01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:05,530
x direction

1064
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:09,690
the complicated three-dimensional wave equation

1065
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:10,890
collapses now

1066
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:14,290
the one dimensional wave equation

1067
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:17,820
of the nine terms that you have here

1068
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,630
only one term survives

1069
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:26,210
and that is d two e EX squared

1070
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:32,210
that then becomes

1071
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:35,190
zero times actually non-zero

1072
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:41,010
and when you take the square the two it is clear the only one to

1073
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:44,510
because there is no you why there is no easy

1074
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:46,530
and so this now becomes

1075
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:48,030
the two

1076
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:52,180
the square so this is now

1077
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:55,620
wave equation i started

1078
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:01,610
now remember that the curl of e

1079
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:06,410
his minor the stability

1080
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:09,930
so the kernel of e

1081
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:11,100
in this case

1082
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:13,620
you can check that because you know what the kernel is

1083
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:17,360
here's the

1084
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,740
the kernel of the e

1085
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:22,030
there's only one trim that survives

1086
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:27,420
right down here the curl of e

1087
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:36,770
the only one term that survived and then is dx c

1088
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,970
in the y direction

1089
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:40,880
and that now must be equal

1090
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,030
two minus

1091
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:44,950
so that is max well

1092
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:54,330
although this and later i will raise it sort it you can see it is

1093
01:12:54,550 --> 01:13:00,730
important that you can see it's above my head

1094
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:04,440
so my question now is what is being

1095
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,930
so this is a traveling wave

1096
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,850
in the same direction

1097
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,410
we've has any vector only in the x direction

1098
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:12,510
as of now

1099
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:16,880
and i want to know what is the associated we feel

1100
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,710
for one thing you can already see that to be field is going to be

1101
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:25,560
in the y direction

1102
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,340
if we take the

1103
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:31,520
so this is the next

1104
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,380
and we take the derivative

1105
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:36,560
again see get minus k

1106
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:40,130
you get easier access

1107
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:46,160
and then the cosine becomes minus sign so this becomes a plus

1108
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:48,710
times the sign

1109
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,870
omega t minus casey

1110
01:13:50,890 --> 01:13:55,360
and that now

1111
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,870
equals minus

1112
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:07,290
so are almost there all we have to do now is doing integration in time

1113
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:11,110
so we bring the DTO does it's important that we get the the y direction

1114
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,340
that is very important

1115
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:19,340
very important

1116
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,980
that's why

1117
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:25,070
very important that's going to be the direction of the field

1118
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:26,670
don't forget that y

1119
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,800
so now you're going to be true here

1120
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:32,220
you do it integration in time

1121
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:34,120
so now you get to be filled

1122
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:40,190
that is going to be associated with that traveling wave

1123
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:41,850
electric field

1124
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,960
so if you do it the goal the omega pops out below here

1125
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,720
so sorry get k

1126
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:49,360
the zero axis

1127
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:53,930
divided by omega

1128
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:57,900
the sign becomes minus the cosine but i also have a minus sign is so

1129
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,460
those two minus signs council

1130
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:03,340
so i get the cosine

1131
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:06,170
of omega t

1132
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:09,370
minus casey

1133
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,340
but only got divided by casey

1134
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:13,640
that is the speed

1135
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:16,660
of light

1136
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:18,840
so i can also write is now

1137
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,330
we write it down we in the y direction

1138
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:27,200
indicate that it is in the y direction

1139
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:32,650
he zero x divided by c because only god divided by casey

1140
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,560
times the cosine

1141
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:37,340
omega t

1142
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:43,990
just to remind you use you why again

1143
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:49,130
but of course the already indicates that

1144
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,050
so now you've found

1145
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:54,680
the b field

1146
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,820
that is associated

1147
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:59,570
with this he feels

1148
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:04,070
i used to say and i said earlier one is the other one can not

1149
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:09,880
without the other

1150
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:14,610
so if we compare the two now you see two you see several things

1151
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:17,070
which holds in general

1152
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:21,140
that is you see that the the magnitude of the if you do the math

1153
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,290
of the b field

1154
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:25,860
the magnitude of the b field you can call these zero why

1155
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,820
seat times lower

1156
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:30,320
then the magnitude of if you

1157
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:32,870
cdc here

1158
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,900
notice also that

1159
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,440
the field

1160
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:39,330
and the be field in phase with each other

1161
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:42,290
you have your cosine omega t minus casey

1162
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,360
you have the same here

1163
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:46,840
there is no phase difference between them

1164
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:50,810
that means if one reaches a maximum the outer reaches a maximum and if one

1165
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:52,920
is zero the other is zero

1166
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,330
because they oscillate

1167
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:59,070
with that frequency omega

1168
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,210
notice also that b

1169
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:03,660
is perpendicular to e

1170
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:08,240
because he's in the next election and is in the y direction

1171
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,860
notice also that

1172
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:14,070
each one of them is perpendicular to the direction of propagation

1173
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,120
is perpendicular to the direction

1174
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:19,120
and b is perpendicular

1175
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,430
two to see direct

1176
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,310
all this follows

1177
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:28,630
from maxwell's equations

1178
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:30,570
now i would like to make

1179
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:34,010
of what

1180
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:40,150
this electromagnetic wave looks like

1181
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:44,880
and i will make an attempt to make you see it's not so easy

1182
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:48,080
but i make an attempt

1183
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:50,310
so here

1184
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:51,310
is the

1185
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,420
x direction

1186
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,580
and here is the y direction

1187
01:17:56,580 --> 01:17:57,790
and this b

1188
01:17:57,810 --> 01:18:03,820
the same direction

1189
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,690
i pick

1190
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:14,980
a particular moment in time

1191
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:17,400
so that just picks at

1192
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,400
put them on the continent

1193
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:20,560
on top of that

1194
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:28,950
these are typically graphical display that's it doesn't need to graphic and text sometimes flash

1195
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:33,430
media but it's really just graphical act and the showing

1196
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:36,630
increase the band evanescence the

1197
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:40,140
and since that i just want to reach as many users as possible

1198
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:44,340
want that to use is typically CPM cost per impression

1199
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:47,990
that's not really thinking that users will click on the

1200
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:53,160
they just want users to see the accent and the rest

1201
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,160
that is displayed

1202
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:56,910
different from that is

1203
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:58,430
context matters

1204
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:03,130
there is some content on some but it for instance in this case

1205
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:04,530
this is the photography

1206
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:09,680
a forum for photographers first and on the side we show at which is in

1207
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:12,010
so for instance

1208
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:13,400
this is one the

1209
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:18,030
olympus digital cameras so it is relevant to the content of the page

1210
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:19,320
so here

1211
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:23,200
what i want is that the user should be attracted to me

1212
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:26,680
and attracted enough to actually click on it

1213
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:28,900
like a lightning rod

1214
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:30,140
so in this case

1215
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:34,780
that works problem is slightly more complicated instead of just pushing out the

1216
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,820
you want which are actually very relevant to the one

1217
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:42,970
that the user is ninety two actually like can be attracted to click on so

1218
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:46,570
so typically these extra as short

1219
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:50,800
and also on the page will be use it is actually interested in

1220
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,050
however the problems here that

1221
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:57,490
we use independence very

1222
01:19:57,510 --> 01:20:00,430
so you can do it photographer's forum

1223
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:03,530
does that mean that you are interested in buying digital cameras

1224
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:06,050
is it just because you

1225
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:09,740
you just browsing the forum and you want to read some stuff and if you're

1226
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:11,800
just not interested in buying

1227
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,470
if you're not going to show by

1228
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:17,470
and that is not really gaining anything but surely is

1229
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:22,070
and again thickening of what is it called matching acts is called is a very

1230
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:23,130
hard problem

1231
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:27,510
because what is really the content for instance for food what is the content of

1232
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:28,300
the form

1233
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:32,470
because there are many different topics to be discussed by many different users and so

1234
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:34,880
so the twenty fourth that

1235
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:37,880
that the page which they want match that

1236
01:20:37,930 --> 01:20:42,110
this but it is very long it's very noisy as many different we don't know

1237
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:45,280
exactly what the user is looking for

1238
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:51,070
together these two the onto your user intent on the very long and noisy queries

1239
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:54,930
mean that he creates a fairly low some said

1240
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:55,840
and so

1241
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:59,260
typically one CBC

1242
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:05,110
there will be only when they click on not just when you should be

1243
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:07,490
i think this is the

1244
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:08,590
is that

1245
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:13,930
familiar setting of sponsored search and this is probably the biggest

1246
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:15,430
the most common setting in

1247
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:19,320
thank you so because this is a lot of money for many different

1248
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:21,030
so here

1249
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:23,760
they use to search for it

1250
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:26,840
so that's and it's iniquity

1251
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:32,590
you want show sponsored search that we generally with this user query

1252
01:21:32,610 --> 01:21:34,450
so the nice thing here is

1253
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:36,780
you don't need to be axed at the end of the

1254
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:40,990
according to the page because you know exactly what the user is interested in

1255
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:42,720
you know what the user said

1256
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:47,610
i'm interested in buying digital cameras something you just one of the big apps that

1257
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:50,240
match is given way

1258
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:53,510
so the good thing is that the user declares

1259
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:56,970
his intention for instance the user says that

1260
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:01,110
is the key word in my search when their immediately north

1261
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:02,760
this user is very interesting

1262
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:06,740
product but adaptation become which are about

1263
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:10,470
this particular product and there is a high chance the user would be interested that

1264
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,400
again since

1265
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:16,880
the query is very short typically what he works

1266
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:21,070
it's much easier to pick good at is quite good

1267
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:22,840
and matching the school

1268
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:23,760
and so

1269
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:28,720
typically the click rates are much higher in sponsored search than in one match

1270
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:31,990
and the revenue model again it's typically cost per click

1271
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:34,240
so that has to be you if

1272
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:40,040
if you want good enough access users having to click and yet there has been

1273
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,200
some recent move towards

1274
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:44,320
when two of the CPA model

1275
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:49,090
you want to use this to create and then by or something but it can

1276
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:52,360
this still the CPC's more

1277
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:57,680
questions about this for example

1278
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:09,180
so those are two important properties it's maximisation the pointwise supremum

1279
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:11,200
then another

1280
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:12,800
a natural question is

1281
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:17,170
suppose i have a composition of two functions h and g

1282
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:23,380
are some special properties on that allow you to conclude that the composition of h

1283
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:25,380
in g is convex if you know

1284
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:28,720
properties of agent she separately

1285
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:34,360
and there are several tombs like this for example if g is convex

1286
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:39,070
and h is convex nondecreasing then f is convex

1287
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:43,790
or a g is concave and it is convex and non increasing

1288
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:48,650
for example the exponential g is convex if g is compact

1289
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:53,940
because in this case it's the second property g if g is convex

1290
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:56,390
then well an exponential

1291
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:03,240
actually first property exponentially is convex and increasing so x but you

1292
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:08,130
one of the ricci will be convex if g is concave and always positive

1293
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:09,640
because then

1294
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:12,210
you this theorem second one

1295
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:16,340
h is just one over x o positivex

1296
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:23,090
and this sort of technicality here if you

1297
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:25,790
is a increasing or nondecreasing

1298
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:29,260
then you have to look at each over its entire domain

1299
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:33,610
and the assumption is that if x is outside the domain you find the infinity

1300
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:41,560
for example if you have a h is excreted

1301
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,760
but it's only defined for positive x

1302
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:45,890
that's not an increasing

1303
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:48,560
because it's only defined for positive x

1304
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:53,120
then negative x your assumption is that the present political negative effect

1305
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:55,540
and if you look at the at the end of the week

1306
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,470
it's of increase

1307
01:24:58,510 --> 01:24:59,970
and if you didn't

1308
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:07,150
if you forget about this sometimes you get wrong results for this composition

1309
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:10,780
and we can do the same for effective composition the only difference is a to

1310
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,310
the function of the vector

1311
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:18,270
so each of the component is replaced by non linear function g k

1312
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,050
and then you have actually many more

1313
01:25:20,190 --> 01:25:24,440
possible to these are but two examples g

1314
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:28,250
it's each component GI's effect and it is convex

1315
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:33,660
and nondecreasing in each article meaning everything all other arguments and only three things

1316
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,430
in each arguement

1317
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:37,600
this is called

1318
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:43,440
for example the sum of the logarithms of GI effects is concave if g is

1319
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,570
concave and positive policy on this

1320
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:51,530
and then there's also because log some of x the financial GI effects is convex

1321
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,870
if g is convex

1322
01:25:53,930 --> 01:26:00,240
because we've seen that the log of the sum of x x is convex

1323
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:02,630
i was one of the examples earlier

1324
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,400
it's also increasing

1325
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,150
in each variable

1326
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:09,030
please your argument x and exponentially

1327
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:16,970
convex function g i think it's because of its position

1328
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:22,440
another property is something that looks very much like this maximisation property but now it's

1329
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,400
applied minimisation

1330
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:30,470
so again we take a function f of two variables u of x y

1331
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:34,070
and this property it tells us that the certain conditions b

1332
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:36,370
the minimum of over

1333
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:38,310
the second component is

1334
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:40,500
if you if you minimize over y

1335
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:46,350
x then the resulting function fx is convex the other property that we had before

1336
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,430
was the supreme court

1337
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:49,150
f of x y

1338
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:50,990
and maximize over y

1339
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:53,770
i go the convex function of x

1340
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:57,270
here the the condition was that if had to be convex in x for fixed

1341
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,840
and then there is no

1342
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:05,120
restriction on how it depends on my why doesn't have to be a continuous variable

1343
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:06,600
could be an integer

1344
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:07,340
i think

1345
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:10,140
and there is no restriction on this set

1346
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:14,960
the only condition was had be convex in x x y

1347
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:19,190
so here something similar but we it's you need some conditions on y

1348
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:23,580
the first of all we need the function f to be jointly convex in x

1349
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:29,790
just explore exploit jointly convex in x y

1350
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:35,430
and then this set see that the minimisation over has to be convex

1351
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:40,370
that's true then the result of this minimisation is a convex function

1352
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:43,010
available to minimize y

1353
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:46,270
and you are the result of the function of x

1354
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:50,550
and if it's convex joined in x and y then conflict

1355
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:55,270
so an example would be suppose i have a convex set s

1356
01:27:55,290 --> 01:27:59,040
and compute i define a function f of x as the business of the point

1357
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,750
x to the set s

1358
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,860
before if x is in s and this is the

1359
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:06,960
if x is outside its this here

1360
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:08,620
o point

1361
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:11,350
so the nearest point means you minimize the norm

1362
01:28:11,380 --> 01:28:13,080
and this is true in any norm

1363
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:15,240
just use for genetic NOR

1364
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:17,600
to minimize the difference between x and y

1365
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:22,000
overall points y and is that the distance x to the

1366
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:27,060
well this is the function convex function of x y and the context right

1367
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:31,760
and then we minimize over a convex

1368
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:33,120
o vectors y

1369
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:37,710
therefore this minimisation is convex function of x

1370
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:47,440
and the the last one is similar to this linear fractional property that we saw

1371
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:50,060
four sets

1372
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:54,600
so it's not the construction of a convex function gives you another new convex function

1373
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,930
suppose f is convex

1374
01:28:56,980 --> 01:29:00,310
and then i replace to introduce new variable t

1375
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:03,010
can very easy in addition to the

1376
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:04,710
currently like

1377
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:07,920
so there is the argument of x over the

1378
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:11,180
and i multiply functionality

1379
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:15,380
and i do this for positive values of p and

1380
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:19,410
this me new function of x and the theta

1381
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:22,430
OK so the same bound the number of

1382
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:27,960
when we speak

1383
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:40,520
not so this is not only wrong but it's also negative quantity and the drop

1384
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:42,870
it because i'm not about

1385
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:44,910
not it

1386
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:49,680
w zero zero from zero that that the

1387
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:58,040
OK so now this game is also a bound on the number of mistakes

1388
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,390
we're mistake

1389
01:29:59,390 --> 01:30:00,580
it is

1390
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:04,870
all the update in which my in laws

1391
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:09,730
it was my matching with making up whenever the lot is bigger than the zero

1392
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,410
but sometimes my

1393
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:15,270
nineteen left so be that my matching is negative

1394
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:16,410
and and

1395
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:17,750
because of this

1396
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:21,710
but this is not about the number of states

1397
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:25,960
the terms about bounds the number and they don't say anything that in the perceptron

1398
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:32,790
but they get relationship that you can describe in

1399
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:40,520
not that i cannot say anything about converges to the solution here

1400
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,850
i should be question

1401
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:29,770
so is asking whether

1402
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:35,270
you say that that is not just the strict inequality

1403
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:42,120
could i don't know whether it so the question is whether this bound can be

1404
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:44,210
expected achieve

1405
01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:45,060
if the

1406
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:46,180
the question

1407
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,310
so whether this is there are situations in which

1408
01:31:49,330 --> 01:31:50,660
this can be achieved

1409
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:53,080
i don't know

1410
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:58,500
in terms of discrete orthogonal i know and i will tell you of value about

1411
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,440
it later

1412
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:02,390
that in the case of mistakes

1413
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:04,310
it is true

1414
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:12,230
OK so mistakes i can that situations in which the perceptron convergence theorem is by

1415
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:15,580
so i believe that

1416
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:17,040
i don't know about this one

1417
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:21,310
and i hope that this is an idea but i together with of perception is

1418
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:30,730
not that there was little before is that we are not getting it converges to

1419
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:33,250
the solution

1420
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:39,000
because we were making up their whenever our model is

1421
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,790
bigger than smaller than one

1422
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:43,460
and we have a fine

1423
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,710
upper bound on the cumulative in

1424
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:47,980
that we

1425
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:55,080
we don't know how much we can lower bound the progress that we we make

1426
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,000
make it

1427
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:04,710
could make it happen because this guy

1428
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:08,100
i just find it funny because the rhyme

1429
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:12,560
so what i make up that whenever making up the space only when we know

1430
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,160
that these guys because they want

1431
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:18,060
so we can say something

1432
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:21,480
because there's nothing but unfortunately we don't get the game

1433
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,200
converges the SVM solution

1434
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:30,440
so there are variants of perceptron that the approximate bitter close solution

1435
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:32,330
one of them is out now

1436
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:37,250
the green by club didn't feel that as several other

1437
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:41,850
might probably the closest to the original percent

1438
01:33:41,870 --> 01:33:47,160
so you can you can use iterative update the perceptron like well approximated from the

1439
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,040
this is not what one of them

1440
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:19,980
no this is not state is that this the real off

1441
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:22,250
so we know that

1442
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:25,200
we that we can about the number of up

1443
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:30,020
we can bound the because any and every up can control the

1444
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,620
caused by it too long to be close to zero

1445
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:34,940
in proc

1446
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:35,910
we can only

1447
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:39,290
one particular giving the of

1448
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:44,370
all you the states sorry for you

1449
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:45,310
of course

1450
01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:50,960
thank you said before you can about the number of mistakes

1451
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:54,430
so the number of your everything making up

1452
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:58,140
you might have been mistaken depending on whether you're in the last is bigger than

1453
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:00,350
one or smaller than one

1454
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:05,930
six is this

1455
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:10,870
and in any case the squared hinge loss is an upper bound on the

1456
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:14,620
on the non of them if they show you know that whenever you make a

1457
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:18,120
mistake it involves a great deal of its upper bound

1458
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:24,460
and when you don't make a mistake it is a positive or zero

1459
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:28,730
so it is true it is also an upper bound on the

1460
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:32,890
but is the same as perceptron in terms of number of states is that anything

1461
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:34,710
more than

1462
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:45,700
now what about the nonseparable streams here

1463
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:49,620
again there is there are a couple of ways of showing this i want to

1464
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,120
show you

1465
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:55,580
how to deal with non separable streams by using a reduction

1466
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:58,660
which i think is is the cool trick

1467
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:02,930
and you know computer scientist love reduction error

1468
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:05,330
so i hope you like

1469
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:07,930
in other areas of

1470
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:11,230
of of logic based knowledge representation

1471
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:18,830
especially for software engineering where this is very useful mechanism as well to capture modularity

1472
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:23,190
so so this is the bad news but the good news is that we can

1473
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:27,650
approximate coverage without losing this guarantee

1474
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:34,170
and what we will see in a little bit is the syntactic approximation of semantic

1475
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:35,950
approximation of

1476
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:37,910
the real coverage

1477
01:36:38,650 --> 01:36:42,020
better to sort of conservative extensions are

1478
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:49,040
they the property of this is that it's very fast it is syntactically don't need

1479
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,490
to reason or to computer module

1480
01:36:51,530 --> 01:36:56,360
the other good news is that we can still guarantee module so so so so

1481
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:59,750
we do not give up on this coverage property

1482
01:36:59,790 --> 01:37:03,870
we might get slightly too big modules

1483
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:05,270
but so far

1484
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,680
the modules we got were

1485
01:37:07,690 --> 01:37:12,590
nobody complained about versus how it contains thirty four axioms and i think it should

1486
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:15,250
only contain thirty two axes

1487
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:19,900
so we have compared it with other mechanisms it has to be told that there

1488
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,630
have been

1489
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:25,280
modularisation approaches around where

1490
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:27,570
you don't get this coverage

1491
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:33,160
guarantee but which computes still larger model so we're looking into this and i don't

1492
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:38,490
think we're quite hopeful that this is a very useful way of computing this module

1493
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:40,480
and you will see it

1494
01:37:40,530 --> 01:37:44,200
them in action in the second

1495
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:48,430
a last point i want to mention safety

1496
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:52,790
coverage and safety are sort of dual to each other and i won't go into

1497
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:57,320
any further detail about safety but it's another thing that you should keep in mind

1498
01:37:57,730 --> 01:38:01,620
all that i want you to take home from here that this is an important

1499
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:06,430
thing when you design ontologies in a modular way

1500
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:15,160
this assuming that you want to reuse module from another ontology because you don't know

1501
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:19,310
this this topic of the topic that this module covers very well you're not an

1502
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:24,550
expert then you want to preserve it while through the important

1503
01:38:24,610 --> 01:38:29,670
so you don't want to change the meaning of the importance of the important terms

1504
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:31,530
through the impart action

1505
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:33,710
now all being o

1506
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:39,280
encapsulation doesn't come with all doesn't have any any notion of this encapsulation and it

1507
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,740
could well be that before

1508
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:49,670
before the import arthritis was not a genetic disorder and then new imported and suddenly

1509
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:53,030
arthritis happens to be a genetic disorder

1510
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:57,910
we don't want this if we are not really experts in this area

1511
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:05,030
this is a very important topic in the modular you usage of ontologies

1512
01:39:05,050 --> 01:39:11,440
it is also closely related to what we have seen before to this conservative extensions

1513
01:39:11,450 --> 01:39:16,030
it's on an ongoing subject in research and development and i just ask you to

1514
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:19,270
just stay tuned because i'm very

1515
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:25,540
hopefully optimistic that's the part of this safe reuse will be soon provided as well

1516
01:39:25,570 --> 01:39:26,880
it's on its way

1517
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:29,490
and now i hand over

1518
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:31,690
message here

1519
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:32,780
which will

1520
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:36,090
provide you with a system that

1521
01:39:36,110 --> 01:39:37,590
if you want to this

1522
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:41,750
so you think you can have your

1523
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:45,140
we're going to do now we show you

1524
01:39:45,150 --> 01:39:49,860
the tools are being developed as plugins for four and this is the point where

1525
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:52,300
you might want to follow along

1526
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,300
i know on laptops

1527
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:58,110
if you

1528
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:14,260
if you download approach foreign extracted set file you get some directory structure looks like

1529
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:16,700
this if you just start show for

1530
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:20,780
using either command all the

1531
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:23,600
batch files from windows

1532
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:26,450
some significant changes to the solution

1533
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:44,920
it's better

1534
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:50,470
so what i want you to following along someone going to show you is first

1535
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:51,920
i want you to open the

1536
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:55,230
univ bench ontology

1537
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:59,800
we chose which you could have downloaded from the website

1538
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:06,390
so low conductance ology first

1539
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,690
and so this is pretty four

1540
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:12,010
being developed at the university of manchester

1541
01:41:12,070 --> 01:41:15,500
designed and developed at university of manchester and what you see is an overview of

1542
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:16,500
the ontology

1543
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:20,370
so this is just the ontology that you've seen for the tutorial this morning

1544
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:22,740
fairly familiar with it

1545
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:31,150
and as holly pointed out this ontology doesn't contain any information about computer science start

1546
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:34,020
so lectures in a CIO

1547
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:37,530
computer science students in which computer science courses they take

1548
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:39,200
and what we would like to do

1549
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:44,530
is extract module from the computer science ontology so if you just think back to

1550
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:46,790
the methodology

1551
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:50,590
what we do first is we load the ontology that we want to take commercial

1552
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:55,270
from when you the complete ontology so i'll open problem one

1553
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:56,870
we open the ontology

1554
01:41:56,890 --> 01:42:01,600
in the same window suppressed yes when you get that dialogue

1555
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:03,290
and selects

1556
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:12,370
computer science ontology

1557
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:21,360
so that that's loaded the name of the ontology shown on the top here

1558
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:26,000
and now what we'll do is extract module if i'm going too fast for people

1559
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,640
who are following along to stick your hand up and i slow down slightly

1560
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:31,090
and so

1561
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:34,810
we have to do this we use was heard

1562
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:38,420
we can get to this from the refactoring manually

1563
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:46,180
which is extracts move axioms

1564
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:47,830
so here we have always said

1565
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:51,940
and there's only one option on the moment and some other options for doing some

1566
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:54,480
of the syntactic extractions of ontologies

1567
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:59,010
in fact seems an ontology but for the purpose of the tutorial have added the

1568
01:42:59,010 --> 01:43:03,840
mean we just want to use this one extract method which uses the methodology that

1569
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,630
all these already outlined

1570
01:43:05,730 --> 01:43:07,920
so the press continued

1571
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:12,370
and then we select the ontology that we want to move or copy axioms from

1572
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:20,340
in this case this computer science ontology

1573
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,180
and then i press continue again

1574
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:26,500
and now we're presented with the pain where we can select the terms from the

1575
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:29,530
ontology we from which we want to take the module

1576
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:35,370
so in this case we want to expand the tree if you do

1577
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:39,820
command click or a old like i think on windows XP whole tree in one

1578
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:44,560
go we want to take turns from this computer science ontology and we want to

1579
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:45,550
use them

1580
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,480
in our university ontology

1581
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:53,230
so to do this we just select items from the tree in the usual way

1582
01:43:53,290 --> 01:43:55,110
and what i'm going to do

1583
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:57,110
it selects faculty

1584
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:00,670
and all of the classes below faculty

1585
01:44:00,670 --> 01:44:03,380
one of the ideas

1586
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:09,060
and this is the idea of constructing this artificial sequences if we have this graphical

1587
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:12,210
model which is basically connected what we do

1588
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,390
and each of these

1589
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:16,190
i can think of these black connections is this

1590
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:17,930
joint probability says

1591
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:24,150
constraints that one does not to be like this this yellow pixels should have

1592
01:44:24,170 --> 01:44:26,800
neighbours should be olympics

1593
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:30,250
what algorithm does then is

1594
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:34,430
you only take a spanning tree

1595
01:44:34,450 --> 01:44:37,280
of the nodes

1596
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:41,040
and this is one very application of our algorithm is much more general than this

1597
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,680
but this is the sort of ideas

1598
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:49,160
adding constraints success you relax the problem to make the problem is

1599
01:44:49,210 --> 01:44:50,280
so you might

1600
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:53,140
take it to a place solar out in

1601
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:56,920
and it's easy to sample a spanning tree we can draw an exact some

1602
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:06,030
using again the forward backward algorithm before back applies to three not just the chains

1603
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:07,120
you have

1604
01:45:07,170 --> 01:45:09,650
you draw samples from that and then

1605
01:45:09,690 --> 01:45:13,200
at the next time step this is the new distribution and what you do is

1606
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:15,390
you move those samples

1607
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,150
by adding this constraint

1608
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:19,820
so the idea is to distribute the samples

1609
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:22,930
and then you add constraints one at the time and you kind of hurt the

1610
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:27,890
samples to this area of very low probability we want to be

1611
01:45:27,950 --> 01:45:30,840
if you have shown the sample something and it's very

1612
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:35,120
again discussed in high dimensions with this very small space where all the samples should

1613
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,170
go too

1614
01:45:36,190 --> 01:45:39,530
then you heard them with by adding this constraint

1615
01:45:39,570 --> 01:45:42,930
it's not different than what is done to solve satisfiability

1616
01:45:42,990 --> 01:45:48,150
problems you know systems and a i where people have these like walksat algorithms for

1617
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:50,820
that constraints one at time

1618
01:45:50,830 --> 01:45:53,090
it's kind of summer so

1619
01:45:53,150 --> 01:45:55,650
the sample sort of my great

1620
01:45:55,690 --> 01:45:59,240
the same is true when you have a model with the static parameter

1621
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:03,980
in europe serving adding observations and this is what japan did

1622
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:05,980
because adding an observation

1623
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,450
is adding constraint on what the model is

1624
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:12,740
every time you add an observation saying i also want to model to be like

1625
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:15,960
too much to be able to explain this observation

1626
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:18,390
so it's adding constraints

1627
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:25,120
so this is pretty much online learning

1628
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:27,680
now skip the mathematical details

1629
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:31,650
it's also used for experimental design

1630
01:46:33,290 --> 01:46:36,570
for the computation of expected utility

1631
01:46:38,370 --> 01:46:42,010
remember that i mentioned so far have been talking only about bayesian inference but

1632
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:47,430
i mentioned in the beginning we also care about of finding out the best action

1633
01:46:47,530 --> 01:46:49,300
for something

1634
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:52,970
here the beautiful idea of peter miller

1635
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,640
his idea was

1636
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:57,990
suppose we want to compute the utility of an action

1637
01:46:58,050 --> 01:47:01,380
and we have a model how states

1638
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:03,710
x is given actions

1639
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:07,970
and we have utilities crashed the stage just like that example we that

1640
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:13,260
yes there was a small stable of reward and so on

1641
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:15,920
what he does

1642
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:18,080
is he

1643
01:47:18,110 --> 01:47:20,610
increases effect is terms

1644
01:47:20,650 --> 01:47:24,120
and multiplies the term by itself again

1645
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:26,010
OK just like that here

1646
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:28,150
and then you marginalize

1647
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:29,850
over x

1648
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:34,050
so you again have a growing state space we start with one term then you

1649
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:35,630
have two then you have three

1650
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:39,630
you growing distaste pages like i was going to graph

1651
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:42,790
and the effect of this is if you do this

1652
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:46,700
what you're doing is you're kneeling in the use

1653
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:49,610
the utility function is getting more and more and more peak

1654
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:53,540
and it's getting paid at the action that the best action so as to sample

1655
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:56,650
the axis you're finding the best action

1656
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:07,570
it's very beautiful if you've ever tried to do is very very hard is one

1657
01:48:07,570 --> 01:48:11,500
of the hardest problems out there and when you and then you can do again

1658
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:14,560
like a particle filter and these are the weights

1659
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:20,180
you interpret the utilities as probabilities normalize them and you can do these sequences

1660
01:48:20,650 --> 01:48:24,310
and that allows you to solve the problem of experimental design

1661
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:25,330
which is

1662
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:32,140
which observations together in order to maximize my knowledge about them on safer planet

1663
01:48:32,150 --> 01:48:33,510
on incomes

1664
01:48:33,530 --> 01:48:36,360
there some sort of meteorite coming around here

1665
01:48:36,370 --> 01:48:41,630
and i want to figure out where to point my instruments

1666
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:43,930
and this experiment will cost me

1667
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:46,110
a hundred thousand dollars

1668
01:48:46,150 --> 01:48:48,090
how can i best

1669
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:53,130
get the most information out of the trajectory of this object

1670
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:58,240
with as few resources as possible so which experiment to carry out or if i'm

1671
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,160
doing clinical trials

1672
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:01,390
how can

1673
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:05,540
when is the best for me to to look at this patient

1674
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:10,060
in order to have the best understanding of how cancer develops

1675
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,850
because you don't want to have the patient come into your office every day access

1676
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:15,430
to expensive

1677
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:17,970
and sort of here is an example where

1678
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:18,980
you have

1679
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,850
very even in this very

1680
01:49:20,890 --> 01:49:22,930
simple case only heart

1681
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:25,260
we have something like a sine wave

1682
01:49:25,900 --> 01:49:29,000
what you're trying to do is you trying to learn

1683
01:49:29,010 --> 01:49:32,980
the parameters a the frequency interface

1684
01:49:32,990 --> 01:49:36,540
based on taking x observations of the sine wave

1685
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:40,830
so this is not permitted process so this is a bunch of sine wave

1686
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:44,780
and if you've taken two points already this point and this point

1687
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:47,650
which every time you get data your class

1688
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:49,710
just like in accounting process

1689
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:53,140
and now you want to know what do i think the next observation

1690
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:55,670
in order to learn the frequency

1691
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:58,130
and so on of this

1692
01:49:58,160 --> 01:49:59,760
i think

1693
01:49:59,850 --> 01:50:05,960
and the NELF after fifty steps in red is the new utility

1694
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:07,180
this is using

1695
01:50:07,190 --> 01:50:09,820
in this case because there one in which we can do numerical

1696
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:13,480
three michigan in numerical computation quadrature

1697
01:50:15,890 --> 01:50:19,760
through the annealing to tell you exactly what to take the next point to take

1698
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:25,420
the next observation

1699
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:30,410
that's also in machine learning this sort of

1700
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:35,540
there's something from the very similar collective learning for active learning to but simpler

1701
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:39,500
which is giving that i have a finite set of objects which one should i

1702
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:44,090
thank you very much

1703
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:45,620
morning everybody

1704
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:53,010
i really appreciate you coming to the

1705
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:55,460
yesterday lavish dinners

1706
01:50:55,470 --> 01:50:57,840
make it one

1707
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:05,180
let's start with a couple of slides

1708
01:51:05,550 --> 01:51:11,340
why this and what the motivations were so

1709
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:13,520
i'm going to to talk about three four

1710
01:51:13,530 --> 01:51:16,340
what the machine learning task

1711
01:51:16,730 --> 01:51:23,950
one of them is classification binary classification so from labeled training positive and negative you're

1712
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:26,880
trying to learn how to use them all

1713
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:28,310
i can see

1714
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:33,270
this is a very long time

1715
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:38,910
there a slightly different is the red task and in my case and i'm talking

1716
01:51:38,910 --> 01:51:44,110
about right which means the training data is ranked it's

1717
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:47,050
and it is still possible to next so

1718
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:51,190
prince they can be movies you like you don't like trying to come up with

1719
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:53,640
the model that was the move is in order

1720
01:51:55,190 --> 01:51:58,390
preceding the name

1721
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:04,390
that is the probability estimation when you

1722
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,280
you want to come model

1723
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:13,500
the posterior probability of the positive class given the description of an example

1724
01:52:14,530 --> 01:52:16,090
questions that

1725
01:52:16,110 --> 01:52:18,190
i'm not pretending to want

1726
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:22,910
morning star and i think some of the most of questions just

1727
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:29,030
to get your mind going about in which you have

1728
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:35,440
one question could be is there a natural hierarchy among these tasks

1729
01:52:35,470 --> 01:52:40,750
and if you think about it and maybe one possible answer could be is to

1730
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:43,250
be the hierarchy is role

1731
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:44,860
on the top so

1732
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:52,180
because the probability estimation of interacting just using the probability is directly descended directly that

1733
01:52:53,370 --> 01:52:55,370
and if you think that would be

1734
01:52:55,380 --> 01:52:56,220
forgiven these

1735
01:52:56,250 --> 01:53:00,660
i mean because that's what i think but i don't want to give you may

1736
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:06,160
be a hint that the difference is that the one

1737
01:53:06,190 --> 01:53:08,660
is the middle

1738
01:53:09,690 --> 01:53:12,870
question you ask is

1739
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:19,370
given most machine learning models you can somehow used to do each of these tasks

1740
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:23,120
and i'll show you a decision trees to do

1741
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:25,880
the tracking probability estimates

1742
01:53:25,970 --> 01:53:26,970
but when you try to

1743
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:33,990
is it simply a matter of adjusting the loss function of futuristic in order to

1744
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,280
try to use

1745
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:40,550
right before it is how to work with svms or do we really need to

1746
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:41,570
figure out

1747
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:45,880
robert that

1748
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:53,620
there is increasing evidence in the literature to be very nice to rochdale yesterday

1749
01:53:53,930 --> 01:53:55,430
that small

1750
01:53:57,190 --> 01:54:01,810
to be classified as a whole practice

1751
01:54:01,810 --> 01:54:05,530
and so to achieve

1752
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:08,250
hi area under curve i will explain what

1753
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:10,910
is if you have seen before

1754
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:14,340
and there is a similar quite

1755
01:54:14,340 --> 01:54:19,120
intriguing analysis that

1756
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:21,840
if so we all know that adaboost

1757
01:54:21,850 --> 01:54:23,590
rank boosting

1758
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:27,060
best case is that the two rank four

1759
01:54:27,370 --> 01:54:35,590
ranking but it turns out that even the original adaboost under certain circumstances produces

1760
01:54:35,650 --> 01:54:37,720
that produces the same ranker

1761
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:40,690
as rank although not necessarily

1762
01:54:40,710 --> 01:54:46,690
with the same speed so these are the most intriguing questions the final question

1763
01:54:46,810 --> 01:54:51,560
i want to throw has to do do with probability estimation

1764
01:54:52,530 --> 01:54:57,920
there is evidence that some of which is good by rail the test

1765
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,740
well some of them

1766
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:02,730
the distortion again

1767
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:03,820
the question is

1768
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:06,570
can we understand more

1769
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:09,180
what can we learn from this

1770
01:55:09,190 --> 01:55:14,270
finally this is my final motivational slide this is also the case

1771
01:55:14,290 --> 01:55:17,320
range is going to be this morning

1772
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:22,770
here is a couple of very simple example simplest example i can then go

1773
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:25,800
to illustrate some of these points so

1774
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:29,980
the first example is intended to show

1775
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:36,390
that's good probability estimation is not necessarily aligned with rank

1776
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:38,200
if you

1777
01:55:38,230 --> 01:55:39,550
look here is

1778
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:44,440
we go with probability one for the positive class probability zero

1779
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:50,830
and suppose that we have for example they all probability roughly point five but they

1780
01:55:50,830 --> 01:55:52,400
are right

1781
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:54,690
a point five two

1782
01:55:54,710 --> 01:56:00,190
o point five one point four nine or something like that and so we're not

1783
01:56:00,190 --> 01:56:01,640
making any remaining as

1784
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:07,500
well i think there is defined as opposed the next so that problem

1785
01:56:07,850 --> 01:56:10,210
we already have

1786
01:56:10,230 --> 01:56:11,500
however the

1787
01:56:13,150 --> 01:56:14,700
o point five

1788
01:56:14,710 --> 01:56:20,810
if you say yes to measure the quality of probability estimates the mean squared when

1789
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:23,830
one of them is one

1790
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:30,620
each of these has square point twenty five to the mean squared error is five

1791
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:38,170
now this second that example we know this because they if you want to in

1792
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:44,450
neither not because it gets zero

1793
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:48,060
the last point five still in

1794
01:56:48,150 --> 01:56:50,820
each roughly twenty five

1795
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,680
two point five four two and a half

1796
01:56:54,690 --> 01:56:56,620
the probability and

1797
01:56:56,620 --> 01:57:00,080
we didn't know that you we assume that we knew it but in fact we

1798
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:03,150
don't know it so we want to estimate

1799
01:57:03,170 --> 01:57:05,870
and here this is the estimation of

1800
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:11,250
being at time t in state i at time t minus one in the j

1801
01:57:11,310 --> 01:57:17,660
and we need to estimate these two things separately

1802
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:21,300
and to do that we need another variable that

1803
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:25,360
there is also handy

1804
01:57:25,410 --> 01:57:26,380
which is

1805
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:31,240
if you remember we used this as far viable which was used to compute the

1806
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:36,800
likelihood of a sequence given the HMM three computed basically the likelihood of the of

1807
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:42,280
the sequence from the start up to time t and big in in state i

1808
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:43,440
at time t

1809
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:46,930
we are going to compute the rest and now we are going to call that

1810
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:48,710
which is

1811
01:57:48,730 --> 01:57:51,870
the probability to to with the rest of the sequence

1812
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:54,570
starting from time t plus one

1813
01:57:54,590 --> 01:57:56,990
and being wife being at time t

1814
01:57:57,050 --> 01:58:01,560
so it's very interesting to see the relation between alpha and beta because i thought

1815
01:58:01,570 --> 01:58:06,880
computers the likelihood of the past and because the likelihood of the future you're going

1816
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:09,510
to see that the joint each other very

1817
01:58:09,580 --> 01:58:11,320
in a very useful either

1818
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:13,470
to compute are expected value

1819
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:15,670
so again

1820
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:20,410
this term will become very useful later and

1821
01:58:20,410 --> 01:58:25,100
furthermore there is variation which i'm not going to go through but you can convince

1822
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:27,260
yourself that it does work

1823
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:32,510
and this derivation is very useful because it transform this term which

1824
01:58:32,530 --> 01:58:34,090
appears very difficult

1825
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:39,220
in two small terms that contains again transition

1826
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:45,960
the same beta for future so now you to have a recurrence

1827
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:47,410
to compute beta

1828
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:51,700
but the recurrence doesn't go into the past but into the future but it doesn't

1829
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:54,670
matter you can compute it in a very efficient way in in the same way

1830
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:59,030
that you were able to compute the phi you can compute the beta

1831
01:58:59,090 --> 01:59:02,070
and in fact it costs the same

1832
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:05,220
to compute the beta band the on far

1833
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:06,840
in the end

1834
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:11,150
the cost to compute all the beta for all the state and all the this

1835
01:59:11,150 --> 01:59:12,340
the this

1836
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:18,610
and time is going to be of the of the number of transitions

1837
01:59:18,630 --> 01:59:21,380
and the number of time steps

1838
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:25,550
now why did we compute

1839
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:27,970
it's been anyway

1840
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:32,900
well in fact this is because we want to do this e step and e

1841
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:36,930
step is to compute the idea make so there are two things to compute basically

1842
01:59:36,930 --> 01:59:40,930
you want to estimate this term the pretty of being in time

1843
01:59:40,930 --> 01:59:45,090
he in state i given the data

1844
01:59:45,110 --> 01:59:47,360
and again

1845
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:50,740
how will not show the derivation but what is very interesting

1846
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:51,950
you can see that

1847
01:59:51,970 --> 01:59:55,360
this decomposes into are as far as i know beta

1848
01:59:55,380 --> 01:59:56,320
and that's all

1849
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:59,150
so we have an efficient way to compute and five

1850
01:59:59,180 --> 02:00:01,550
we have an efficient way to compute beta

1851
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:03,610
and computing the

1852
02:00:03,630 --> 02:00:09,470
jointly using them jointly you can compute the the expectation there so now we have

1853
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:14,090
an efficient way to compute the e step of our HMM that is one part

1854
02:00:14,090 --> 02:00:16,570
of it but the second part

1855
02:00:16,590 --> 02:00:18,150
which is

1856
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:21,070
computing the expectation over

1857
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:23,840
nuclear transition

1858
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:30,990
used you you can still work out the questions the derivation is given here and

1859
02:00:30,990 --> 02:00:35,300
it's it's it's useful to look at them but they will not now be derived

1860
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:39,340
in front of you but you should be able to do it yourself in the

1861
02:00:39,340 --> 02:00:43,930
end you can again is to make that with terms like bit

1862
02:00:43,950 --> 02:00:49,340
as far as transitions and emissions of things that you have already in your hand

1863
02:00:49,630 --> 02:00:54,130
so if you compute phi beta and you already have the mission and transitions with

1864
02:00:54,130 --> 02:00:59,680
that you can compute the expected value of emissions and the expected value of transitions

1865
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:03,260
for all possible transitions and emission and this is

1866
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:05,160
you're e step so

1867
02:01:05,180 --> 02:01:09,510
you have an efficient way to compute is it inviable

1868
02:01:09,530 --> 02:01:11,200
the same way you can compute the

1869
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:16,360
posterior on initial state again it's going to depend on i find bigger

1870
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:19,920
so very handy

1871
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:21,280
and now

1872
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:25,400
so you have done e step and in the end we have two steps first

1873
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:29,630
estimated inviolable and the second is if you have this estimate

1874
02:01:29,670 --> 02:01:34,820
how can you maximize the value of parameters in such a way that that you

1875
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:38,430
maximize the likelihood and what we have seen is that in order to do that

1876
02:01:38,950 --> 02:01:42,260
we only need to maximize this auxiliary

1877
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:43,860
functions so

1878
02:01:44,430 --> 02:01:47,220
what we're going to do is to compute the derivative of the

1879
02:01:47,220 --> 02:01:50,280
function with respect to other parameters of the model

1880
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:53,450
and we're going to said that to zero so we know that we are not

1881
02:01:54,660 --> 02:01:59,240
and we also know that if we maximize its auxiliary function we also maximize the

1882
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:01,570
this can be shown

1883
02:02:01,610 --> 02:02:05,740
as i said for the german so basically

1884
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:09,010
i'm just going to work out the questions but i'm not going to do it

1885
02:02:09,010 --> 02:02:12,590
now in front of you but if you it's quite simple to take the whole

1886
02:02:12,590 --> 02:02:17,920
thing and derived this equation with respect to the various parameters that you haven't said

1887
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:18,840
to zero

1888
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:22,650
have the derivations in on my website if you're interested

1889
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:27,840
and in the end has for the gene and you obtain new values

1890
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:37,130
based on all the values of the transitions and the posterior that you estimated during

1891
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:43,950
and same thing participation in fact if you're in general that people use for emissions

1892
02:02:43,950 --> 02:02:49,130
are things like gaussian mixture model so we know how to compute the you forgot

1893
02:02:49,130 --> 02:02:53,990
initial model so in fact there is a way to efficiently combine the DM of

1894
02:02:54,010 --> 02:02:56,550
HMM billion of g and

1895
02:02:56,570 --> 02:03:01,900
basically it's going to use the same equations that we have seen for GMM

1896
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:06,110
and they're all going to be weighted by the posterior probability of being in a

1897
02:03:06,110 --> 02:03:11,220
given state at a given time and they the same equation so we have the

1898
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:18,510
step equations for HMM as well now that gives us only one iteration through time

1899
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:24,110
after training at greater but we if we iterate this e and e m we

1900
02:03:24,570 --> 02:03:28,180
maximize the likelihood of the training data

1901
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:30,490
this is training

1902
02:03:30,510 --> 02:03:32,180
so we have solved

1903
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:35,240
the second problem of the nature the first one was how to compute the like
