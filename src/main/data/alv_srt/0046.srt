1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,990
section of thing which is going to open for business acumen

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,780
i'll check the website and see if it if

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,660
that's actually what you meant but it may be may something else

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,950
other questions

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,870
other questions

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,490
let me in general i encourage you to ask questions i know that that's hard

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,900
to do in a big lecture setting but we have an advantage over over other

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,060
courses particularly science courses we're not trying to prepare you for the astronomy part of

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,530
the EM cats OK so we don't have to cover a specific syllabus we're not

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,640
even trying to follow a textbook and so we have a little more leeway than

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,210
than is ordinarily true to ask questions and going we're direction so please feel free

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,330
to do that i reserve the right to to put the question off into into

13
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,350
the future or or into discussion section or something but do by all means ask

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,760
we have we have some freedom of action yes

15
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,360
an early final

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,000
let me think about that i prefer to avoid because then i have to invent

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,910
another final the problem with that is trying to make them come out even

18
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,410
i will say this that if i do an early final i'm probably going to

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,990
err on the side making it hard

20
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,690
but it's very hard to make them come out even but but but let me

21
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,490
think about them

22
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,790
other questions

23
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,500
it's going to be some of the so the question is what the discussion section

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,920
is going to be like are they're going to be discussion of the problem of

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,910
the problem sets are is going to be sort of a general discussion of course

26
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,900
material and the answer is both i think they will both in any given discussion

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,720
section there were probably both be an opportunity to talk about the previous problem set

28
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,100
out to clarify things about the next problem set and also some kind of activity

29
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,430
that sort extends in advance is what we've been talking about in class so i'm

30
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,540
hoping to do some of both if we veer too much in either one direction

31
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,270
that's probably not a good thing there will be other ways of getting help as

32
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,290
well if you start to have trouble on the problem set during the course generally

33
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,480
i'll talk about those of little bit on thursday

34
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,420
yes sir

35
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:21,490
however problems such great it very carefully let's see

36
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:29,400
i think will probably it'll probably be on a kind of zero to twenty point

37
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,520
schedule but but let me say this about the problems that they're going to be

38
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,000
two kinds of things on the problem one are kind of quantitative problems which have

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,600
the right answer those are relatively easy to great on some kind of the point

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,230
scale you give partial credit and so forth

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,170
but we will also because this is of course that's not only about the specifics

42
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,010
of this topic but also about science in general were also going to have things

43
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,440
that look kind of like essay questions and problems that those are a little harder

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,970
to great in this way but we've got a great in the same way so

45
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,010
that we can add the points and all talk a little bit more about how

46
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,840
those are great and i will say one thing and one thing that we do

47
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,650
is we make sure that each problem is created by

48
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,690
each problem or as is graded by one t air by myself so that we

49
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,400
don't have different people so that if you're in this section it's not like you're

50
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,680
all the problem sets for that section are all greater by your section leader in

51
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,920
some other section leader great all the other problems because that that leads to imbalances

52
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,530
of various kinds so we're we're we assign each problem to a specific person for

53
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:40,120
the whole class but it's basically zero through twenty scale although what that means varies

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,930
depending on what kind of problem it is also a little bit more about that

55
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:49,230
i will also say there's a rather detailed lateness policy that's linked to the closest

56
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,090
server please read that we're going to stick to it and one of the features

57
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,830
of that is that there will be answer sheets problem sets are typically do thursday

58
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,510
they'll be an answer sheet up the following tuesday

59
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,030
so if you don't get it done by five days after to do your toast

60
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,890
because the answers are posted

61
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,280
other questions

62
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,900
great let's start

63
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,740
this is this is very useful

64
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,440
all right

65
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:25,520
this is going to be all kinds of fun right

66
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:32,600
planets planets around other stars but planets in general so let's start by talking a

67
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,890
little bit about audit planetary orbits

68
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,940
you probably know some of the story originally in the old days

69
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,560
people used to think that the earth was the center of the universe of the

70
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,790
earth was in the middle and planets went around them in circles that's not much

71
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,340
of a circle but you know what i mean and so everything was circles around

72
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,480
the earth

73
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:10,450
and that's what planets did where planets also included to the way their way of

74
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,170
thinking the sun and the moon as well

75
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,950
and so you have these circles around their this is this is what's called the

76
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,670
geo centric model

77
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,840
or in the middle and its associated with the name of a greek astronomer named

78
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:31,160
and the problem with this model is very simple namely that if you actually go

79
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,890
out and observe where the planets and the sun and the moon are named after

80
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:41,620
night after night it doesn't work very well so this doesn't fit the observations

81
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,270
doesn't fit observations

82
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:49,790
exclusion principle you have to keep shifting the energy's and since you only have 1

83
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,580
electron here as you move out in this case sodium you'll find your filling 2

84
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,180
by 2 and all of the bonding orbitals are filled with the tiny energy difference

85
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,690
and this is out of the reading this is the same same idea only it's

86
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,550
done in the case of of lithium and lastly this is the idea of trying

87
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:11,770
to get across that here's the metal sitting at rest and now there's a electrical

88
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,630
potential put across at which wants to move electrons even with a modest potential that's

89
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,150
enough to disrupt the bonding here

90
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:25,320
in the uppermost levels in cause electrons to rise and then move along the

91
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,060
antibonding orbitals quite freely

92
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,940
so that gives us a sense of what's going on in the conductivity of something

93
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:39,050
like copper sodium but now let's think about something like magnesium magnesium is a metal

94
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:44,670
was able what's going on with magnesium magnesium has 3 s

95
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,890
but it has 3 to

96
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:53,840
case of magnesium magnesium history has to so if we start filling magnesium estimation and

97
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,030
we're going to fill 2 by 2 all the way up to the top

98
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,680
all the way up to the top of this is and the Pisa up here

99
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,630
what happens when the piece split into the bands

100
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,510
that's the real issues and mercifully what happens in the case of magnesium is this

101
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:19,420
is the SVM but for magnesium the peed on the bottom of the penalized

102
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:28,910
below the top of the acid so recently means this is now the band and

103
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,130
the band energy levels are available so that when we feel the top of the

104
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:39,470
yes Men we can continue to move into a range of energy that allows for

105
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:45,350
motion so that were able to account for both unpaired electron atoms and paired electron

106
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,310
atoms by

107
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:52,740
this overlap of our energies and I think there's a cartoon you're reading that indicates

108
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,740
the shows what happens with the energy levels as a function of distance and you

109
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,910
can see that the p band is now dropping below the

110
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:11,630
on top of the and so allows for continuous filling into more states and so

111
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,960
this now accounts not only for such things as electrical conductivity but reflectivity metals have

112
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,940
lost because the photons of visible light have the capacity to excite electrons which immediately

113
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,200
cascade down and reflect back so you know band theory became

114
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,150
widespread popularity in the twenties it was known only among few physicists in the thirties

115
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,890
the scientific community in the forties infected the popular culture if you talk to your

116
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,480
grandparents will refer the forties as the big band error

117
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,030
because of this you know maybe you thought maybe you thought that the reason the

118
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:56,330
big band era was named Big band was due to people like the Glenn Miller

119
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:02,050
and Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey not was due to felix bloch walter height and

120
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,230
fritz london so I don't want to think about those bandleaders anymore this is the

121
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,530
band this is the big right here right so

122
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,700
people now let's go on to something a little bit more interesting 1 of the

123
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:24,590
other shortcomings that was a manager of addressed by drew was the ability to distinguish

124
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:29,150
between metals and insulators so let's see if this theory can do that so let's

125
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,310
go to something like dying so if we start with diamond if we stay here

126
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,850
carbon as a single gas molecule and we start off with 2 ask

127
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:47,040
and 2 and we know that this then hybridizes to maximize bonding capability so this

128
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,890
is now SP three put to here for reasons that will become apparent in a

129
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:58,170
minute so this is now carbon in the diamond configuration as a single gas molecules

130
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,370
there sort of a sort of 1 hand-clapping but this is this blown carbon that

131
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,480
willing to form diamond and skip over the diamond and the let's just go to

132
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,130
diamond crystal so it will happen at these levels will divide and in accordance with

133
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:19,500
poly exclusion principle will start up here with the anti bonding and will start down

134
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,180
here with the bonding and what happens in the case of the alignment is that

135
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:30,570
when the population of anti bonding

136
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:38,070
there is an energy gap between the bottom of the anti bonding orbitals and the

137
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,910
top of the bonding orbitals

138
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,650
so we have 2 bonds here before we simply have a single bond this would

139
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,410
have given us an estimate these these would be the set all come from S

140
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,350
S 3 forming sigma bonds but in this case there is a big divide here

141
00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:01,830
so this is the energy gap or some people call the band gap and the

142
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:07,480
energy here is given a simple piece of energy the band gap energy and in

143
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,740
the case of diamond the band gap energy is 5 . 4

144
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,260
electron volts

145
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,970
what happens now

146
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:30,500
but still that's 1 2 3 4 and accountants properly assuming we've got a single

147
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,590
occupancy we filled to the top of the valence band this is known as the

148
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:42,180
valence band because these were these were bonding orbitals

149
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,920
we filled to the top of the valence band and now if we want to

150
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,180
apply electrical potential to cause these electrons to come out of the bonds and move

151
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,350
up and down the crystal we gotta come up with 5 . 4

152
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,770
which is a substantial amount of energy and it doesn't happen so as a result

153
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,390
of this is an insulator

154
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:13,040
so we now have the capacity to distinguish between metals and insulators insulators insulators have

155
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,850
high band gaps typically on the order of about 3 electron volts

156
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,910
metals metals have

157
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:31,780
but no bandgaps no bandgap continuous availability of these closely spaced orbitals are and why

158
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,500
we're in the neighborhood this upper this upper band that consists of all the anti

159
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,150
bonding orbitals is called the conduction band

160
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,760
the conduction band because this doesn't involve electron is in

161
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:51,370
this upper band free to move and under the influence of electrical potential

162
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,330
so to have valence band conduction band band gap

163
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,390
analysis look at 1 of the ones with silicon silicon

164
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,610
was look at silicon silicon is in the same family is group for S P

165
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:12,210
3 hybridized only in the case of silicon we're gonna start with 3 s atomic

166
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:19,850
orbital and the 3 p atomic orbitals which to to give us the three but

167
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,980
so consider

168
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:27,170
linear problem with just two water so we are trying to estimate

169
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,820
three coefficients they they all said and then a one and a two

170
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,280
sometimes even though they y is

171
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:44,160
centre so that there's not that you can forget about this so that but generally

172
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,690
the offset is not included in the independent

173
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,600
so again this is our people go

174
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,850
linear regression problem but we had these

175
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,260
two there

176
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,450
expression of

177
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,160
and so since we're using least squares their function is a

178
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,780
and the contours of these ellipses that our

179
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,500
sitting in the coefficient space and that's what we're trying to pick here so all

180
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,110
the possible but of a one all the possible values of a two and there

181
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,910
are surfaces sitting on top of

182
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,230
and so again this are the contours of the square and somewhere that is the

183
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,110
in the case of these courses

184
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,490
the minimum so

185
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,820
complexity penalty

186
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,430
can be represented by these diamond

187
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,760
so remember

188
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,680
penalize formulation is equivalent to the

189
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:51,800
constrained formulation so this penalty can be equivalently stated as saying that sort but if

190
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,350
a one plus up to about toys less than a certain value and that is

191
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,410
what we are representing here this is

192
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,310
the the meaning of

193
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,810
if the if the coefficients estate within this region

194
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,160
you made in that

195
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,930
so what if i one plus up to about fe two less than a certain

196
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,160
threshold and so on

197
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:18,160
the lasso solution is the first point where these conductors touch

198
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:27,290
in the case of reach regulation that the constrained region is actually a circle

199
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,400
so so

200
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:35,000
that's that's what you almost never get seed coefficients with with reach regulation in high

201
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,980
dimensional space these diamond becomes our lloyd with many many many corners and so when

202
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,880
they when they did

203
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,110
what i see evidence of this approach is one of the corners that's when you

204
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:54,670
get a ball into the coefficients equal to say

205
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:06,510
one so as as the number of a viable increases they

206
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:11,090
they let's say this straightforward quadratic programming way of finding

207
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:17,430
the last so solutions gets more demanding computationally and so some iterative algorithms have been

208
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:23,410
proposed to to approximate the analysis solution and one of those is called the forward

209
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:30,880
stagewise linear regression to approximate the the the solutions and that is an goes roughly

210
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,060
like this

211
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,820
so at the beginning we start with all the coefficients equal to see that we

212
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:42,630
need to small epsilon and get to determine the number of iterations and so there

213
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,720
is good thing goes into these loop

214
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:52,650
it first selects the best predictor out of all that

215
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,590
that fits the core issue of so

216
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,390
we have some coefficients already

217
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,970
that are non-zero and so this is what we call the

218
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,980
they the difference between y and according to model

219
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:12,460
and so we're looking for one predictive model that for best fits this rules again

220
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,340
the difference between these two terms is what we call the issue and then we

221
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,550
increment the coefficient associated with that particular operator by a little bit

222
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,600
and it's so to this is also called epsilon

223
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:30,980
it's stagewise linear regression and so we need to maintain each coefficient by a little

224
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:38,520
so after again jet to determine the number of iterations many of the coefficients will

225
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,390
be zero namely those that were never updated

226
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:49,570
and in general they the absolute value of these coefficients is smaller than than the

227
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,620
absolute value of the

228
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,610
and what i solution the least square solution

229
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:04,430
and here acts as the inverse of the complexity parameter so namely we so

230
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:11,020
lambda equal to see domains normalisation lambda equal to infinity means a lot of realization

231
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:16,560
so we start with a lot of decision with maximal right ascension lambda equal to

232
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,410
and so the meaning all the coefficients are equal to zero and then we as

233
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,220
algorithm involves

234
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,000
it can only

235
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:35,490
relaxes the relaxation and eventually we get to the and regularize solution

236
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:44,150
all the pertinent elements a preferences for this iterative way of computing the

237
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,510
that's so that they

238
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,720
their technique called lars

239
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:54,330
by from last however it is limited to least score

240
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:58,610
and then more recently which we mentioned in the beginning and so the ground electoral

241
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,730
legislation which allow us to apply

242
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:08,980
this framework to different loss functions so lisa square is not best function when you

243
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:14,310
have outliers and and it's so it's it's it's better to have least absolute deviation

244
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,850
of something called the who are laws for was regulation and so the this this

245
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:28,360
paper extends that framework or extend this iterative framework into the water was loss functions

246
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,830
and so again as in was evolving

247
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,520
what we have here is something like this and this is what are called the

248
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,320
coefficient path at the beginning

249
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:44,800
all the coefficients are equal to zero the the the the horizontal axis here is

250
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,590
the evolution of the

251
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,450
here i took the wrong picture because i wanted to to one where n was

252
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,400
here but we know that

253
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,430
n and land

254
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,410
how they are related

255
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,580
but again so that the horizontal axis is the evolution of the iterative algorithm the

256
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,990
vertical axis is the value of the confusion and what we see is how they

257
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,490
want the coefficients evolved at we relax

258
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:18,080
the realization fronto parallel decision to not decision so there in all the coefficients are

259
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,000
zero in this problem

260
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,310
o which comes from in there

261
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,290
the prostate cancer data that it's also so widely available

262
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,150
out there i think there were one two three four five six seven eight a

263
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,020
lot of rules and so

264
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:40,090
the first level enters the model and its coefficients starts growing and then another viable

265
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,950
interest model later on and so on there

266
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:50,450
red bar here is indicative of the optimal value of the relaxation parameter like in

267
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,930
going to do the following so

268
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,600
first i would like to

269
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,390
two something which is kind of

270
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,760
i think new

271
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,800
example of application for this for visualization and for motion estimation that i will discuss

272
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,950
some connection between the lab class and

273
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,730
and she equation

274
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:22,350
i'm planning to talk about semisupervised learning and clustering and this is

275
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,160
possibly an ambitious

276
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,230
OK so

277
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,770
need to

278
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:38,650
show you what this embedding so part of this talk about using this again vectors

279
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,230
as a tool for dimensionality reduction

280
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,650
let me just show you what it looks like

281
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,370
this is actually

282
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,800
and you

283
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,550
was red

284
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:20,770
so there are more than half of them you can see above

285
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:27,010
many of them you can which is a good thing and basically the same images

286
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,350
of handwritten digits

287
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,990
which embedded in this what appears to be a three dimensional space but it's actually

288
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:43,900
two-dimensional up since only the projection on the screen using principal components analysis

289
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,650
so this image is taking us points each point

290
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,260
each image

291
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,790
it's just the pixel matrix you can flatten it out as the vector put it

292
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,820
in a high dimensional space the dimensionality being the number of

293
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,630
then reduce the division out OK

294
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,190
so that

295
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,970
so this is

296
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,030
principal components analysis

297
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,130
and need to

298
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,980
so you can kind of see the principal component analysis

299
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,670
bind to them altogether although it's not so bad

300
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,310
now you can

301
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,540
well was a

302
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,630
you can see that

303
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,880
you can see that actually

304
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,530
manifold methods at least

305
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:44,230
finally tends to you know have some much nicer structure this digits of the same

306
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,570
kind of close to get so

307
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,540
so unfortunately you can see

308
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,500
you just have to believe

309
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,440
that if you

310
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,850
look back you see seven some lines and if you look above the ninth of

311
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:05,230
may each image is just representation is just to leave the label was the actual

312
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,500
people in the space

313
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:12,570
i think the point in three dimensional space in each point is labeled as a

314
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,470
little bit of the

315
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,000
of the actual digit it's cut

316
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,760
there are actually four future by nine

317
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,810
and if you think about why that may be so

318
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,450
the force around

319
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:32,780
if you think about why this may be

320
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:38,730
in fact it's about point i suppose

321
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:41,410
they don't know how to use it

322
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:48,130
and why is that well if you think about what it is

323
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,860
you can see that

324
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,700
if you can

325
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,850
and so

326
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,130
if you have one nine and seven

327
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,030
how do we go from four to seven well one way to go is first

328
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,430
to complete a

329
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,800
and then remove the bottom of the list

330
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,630
right so nine is actually in between four and seven so that's what you

331
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,120
so it's kind of cute

332
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,200
and you can imagine so this is actually useful for many data because people do

333
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,830
want to see what they look like people want to see structure in the data

334
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,620
is in fact a lot of statistics

335
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:50,890
you know a lot of classical statistical methods to do exactly that like

336
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,800
multidimensional scaling for example

337
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,260
people use it for various purposes for visualizing different relations

338
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,220
between objects and so on

339
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,360
let me

340
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,380
so here's another application which

341
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,700
i'm not

342
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:21,760
here's the problem so the problem here is to estimate

343
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,570
the motion of the person in this motion is

344
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,950
so you don't actually

345
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,510
of course

346
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,220
again there is no rat so you should believe me that impact around

347
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,500
so this motion

348
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,490
he's actually

349
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,150
there is that i was walking

350
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,090
there is a bunch

351
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:50,250
i you you see that something like that and this cameras allow you to reconstruct

352
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,630
o point on the surface of the person's body

353
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,060
OK so it's kind of working point five

354
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:02,320
now the question is well you would like to be able to identify well actually

355
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,760
the question they

356
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,760
the interested in is to be able to identify angles between joint like this and

357
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,860
and so this was

358
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,650
ignored the letters from and these were the models this was the same thing i

359
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,050
did many models that we accepted

360
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,360
in these

361
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,630
indiana's simulations and then i plotted the other models on it

362
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,530
and notice that we incorporated all the models

363
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,820
in an hour

364
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,450
there was inserted prior this there was that norway

365
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,300
did a study where they actually strider separate separate out with air

366
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,050
these two things

367
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,820
and notice where it went

368
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,610
smack on top of vehement

369
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,720
they determine about ten percent

370
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,950
ten percent the drop was due to

371
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,630
ten percent the drop is due to screening twenty percent drop is due to

372
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,130
imagine terribly

373
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,880
conclusions from model them

374
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:13,970
bayesian approach ideally suited for comparative effectiveness research if you know what that means is

375
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,180
if you don't know what it means

376
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:22,880
the bayesian approach encompasses the other six miles probability distributions are parameters are necessary for d processing

377
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,610
predictive uncertainty

378
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,150
i would like dredge this up for the occasion

379
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,680
the demonstrate to my knowledge in japanese

380
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,030
seriously i'm told

381
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:42,780
that this

382
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,110
becoming bayesian salami clinical development

383
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,130
and for those many a view who speak japanese if it in fact says

384
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,590
pay no attention to this idiot

385
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,050
and please don't tell me

386
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,820
so this is the change genes

387
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,860
attitude in

388
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,720
the medical world generally

389
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:12,430
about the bayesian approach and looking for something better we've achieved this level

390
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,200
they randomized trial

391
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,530
and we sort of complacent and i mean after all the randomized trials over sixty years old

392
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,950
what are the innovation you know has remained essentially unchanged for sixty years

393
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,130
think about

394
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,680
we are complacent with this level

395
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,740
and to take it beyond is difficult

396
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:40,220
because they worry that you're gonna be throwing out the baby with the bathwater

397
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:45,530
on the janet woodcock who's the directorate at the time and still is well

398
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,030
the center for drugs that year after year it's a very powerful person

399
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,740
was lamenting the sorry straight

400
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,880
the sorry state

401
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,260
drug development generally

402
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:04,990
hand suggested that improved utilization of adaptive and bayesian methods could help resolve low success rate

403
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,200
andy thee

404
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,990
expensive phase three clinical trials

405
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:14,240
the latest estimate the cost for developing a drug

406
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,420
is one point eight billion dollars

407
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,400
anne much that's is

408
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,550
in phase three

409
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,300
and much of it due to the fact that

410
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,930
the you know many other drugs fail

411
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,840
and so you have to pay for one with the other

412
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:39,030
can't use a bayesian designs that andy understand since i got there ninety nine

413
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,030
we've had

414
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,970
over three hundred trials

415
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,260
designed and run most the run

416
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:52,010
and accent on the run i mean like a lot of things that you really need in the bayesian literatur

417
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,700
um is you know be great to do this trial

418
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,970
but a course nobody's ever done try

419
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,180
we've designed trials that we've actually run

420
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,510
device companies

421
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:11,760
many devote many designed by very consultants the over twenty five successful approvals

422
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,300
i've devices taking exclusively a bayesian approach

423
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,780
i give you one example

424
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,160
drug companies most the top forty

425
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,860
companies are taking the bayesian approach sometimes

426
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,650
you know wholehearted way tyre

427
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:34,220
programs are to start taking a bayesian approach sometimes it's they just getting their toes in the water

428
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,490
so that if this train leaves the station

429
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:42,110
with e force that some people think it's going to to leave they wanna be on it

430
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:50,570
some areas the application essentially every area of application just a contrast oncology and migraine

431
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:57,550
oncology endpoints usually long in coming as you get information it takes a long time to get information about

432
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,740
what they

433
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:04,320
how the drug was doing in individual patient with my brain registration and pointy end

434
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,650
point that you after uses to make a decision

435
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,550
is two hours pain-free

436
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:09,490
so it's

437
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,030
essentially immediate information

438
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,150
these are in my short rods

439
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,110
order of common this

440
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:25,570
bayesian adaptive trials stopping early relate sometimes

441
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,950
you get to the end of the trial and you wish it were over because

442
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:35,410
they thought about this you of this cannot make sense from the standpoint of the

443
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,010
plum pudding model

444
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,410
this can make sense

445
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:45,970
because the plum pudding model says you've got uniformly distributed charge so far that positive

446
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:53,120
charge uniformly distributed and look at the choices of brilliant experiment you shoot neutrals he

447
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,780
shot alpha particles which have a charge of plus 2 so i got plus 2

448
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,840
zooming in at high energy against a wall of positive charge and most of the

449
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,540
stuff goes flying through so you just say well this is like a bullet going

450
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,960
through pumpkin so what's the big deal but how do explain some of these going

451
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:18,110
way way back and that's when rover says this can't be right I'm going to

452
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:22,820
come up with something else wants to come up with this model to say that

453
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,750
the positive charge is not uniformly distributed I wanna say quite to the contrary the

454
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:34,580
positive charge is concentrated at the center in tiny tiny tiny volume so got this

455
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:41,620
tiny volume with in case of gold 79 + of charge and gets electrons out

456
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,150
here somewhere

457
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,040
and the vast majority of the atom is

458
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,950
this is a lot like democracy

459
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:56,620
being and avoid the convoy

460
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:04,280
so now I've got my + 2 little projectile coming in and and plus 2

461
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,280
zooms right through

462
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,860
but there's a positive 79 so the positives deflected so there's a little bit of

463
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:16,250
deflection because + repels but once in a while 1 of these questions comes in

464
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:22,690
almost all access and it gets whipped around by the moment repulsive forces so that's

465
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,050
Rutherford's explanation of this set of data

466
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,700
so by the way

467
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:39,390
there is a 3rd person there's rather Rutherford Geiger there's Marsden Marx's interesting character Morrison

468
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:44,710
was not too too different from you know Morrison was essentially you're out he he

469
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,600
left school for a couple years he was he was he hadn't got his undergraduate

470
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,690
degree and he come back and Rutherford accepted him lab I think the man was

471
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,950
something like 20 years of age so he said the moznost you don't take these

472
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:02,300
data only give you the dataset of the scattering angles of

473
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:08,600
the atoms his arm did model for this test the assignment

474
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,120
get busy

475
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,180
so well

476
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,320
Morrison came up with a model and as you go through 802 in understand electrostatics

477
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:24,210
electrodynamics you'd be able to do this analysis b is the assumed cross section of

478
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:30,620
the nucleus and then on either side is nothing so you've got a huge distance

479
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:36,040
between centre to center and so all always is doing is asking what must be

480
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:41,010
the if I've got a wall of nothing with spots of high positive charge and

481
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:46,930
this is my scattering data what must be the relative size of the spots versus

482
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:52,450
the nothing and solve the problem and he concluded let's get his name on the

483
00:35:52,450 --> 00:36:01,210
board had he deserves to be born Mazda so Marsden concluded buys analysis that the

484
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,860
radius of the nucleus and this is a rather 4 by the way coining the

485
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:11,490
term it's a nuclear models the nuclear model the radius of the nucleus as compared

486
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:16,210
to the radius of the entire Adam is on the order of about 1 to

487
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:21,970
10 thousand 1 to 10 thousand so indeed we are talking about a lot of

488
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,670
void and a tiny little bit of extremely dense b

489
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,580
so they published this and watch the results you think about the finally solved that's

490
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:36,400
terrific array science at Terri-Jo's eyes out

491
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,640
the reaction to the model was strongly negative do revision was the typical reaction they

492
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,500
said like this is stupid 1st of all this thing can sustain itself you've got

493
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,300
a positive charge here with negative charge

494
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:59,120
around it cools losses the negative will be attracted to the positive and the collapse

495
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:07,910
so that's the 1st objection nuclear collapse everything all the electrons fall into nucleus

496
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,660
In the data suggest that's what it is that's the problem is that the period

497
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:18,440
of the day can explain it so course theoreticians Brussels knows how that said real

498
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,920
to the slaying of a beautiful theory by an ugly fact

499
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:36,860
nuclear collapse so the cool forces kilometer electrostatic forces are drawn out only to write

500
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,940
you know it means the woman forces and the story right number 2 said was

501
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,280
be able to accommodate kernel inefficient way

502
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,150
so i

503
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:48,970
i i i might become a bit about later

504
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,310
in maybe tomorrow of on friday but for now you should be sure that we

505
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,620
it's too much maybe in our

506
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,880
general framework

507
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,820
another thing that few

508
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,130
you might notice that there point that we have one degree of freedom

509
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:11,770
because the the length of this vector doesn't matter in binary classification

510
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,270
because we're going to classify with the findings of this product that's i can scale

511
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,990
w by any

512
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:23,300
positive constant which means that without changing the sign of the classification which means that

513
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,870
they make this i can make a better longer or shorter

514
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,440
without changing the

515
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,270
the plain so without changing the

516
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,470
the output of the classifier

517
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,640
this for now

518
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,400
we have is that the degree of freedom

519
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,200
OK please ask and questions

520
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,700
all the time especially in the beginning because you don't understand something right at the

521
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,430
beginning then going to be

522
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,630
i'm going be

523
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,760
but we're going to get through the red

524
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,340
i don't wish i with her at me

525
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,270
whenever you there's something that

526
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,150
should be explained that year

527
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,430
so now

528
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,260
and i think about the classifiers so what so what is now

529
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:17,110
the online aspect of online learning is different from lake regular

530
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:24,780
batch learning because you don't think of having a training set act as the usual

531
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,750
framework of statistical learning theory refers the

532
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:32,090
that the lectures by the

533
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,870
here you're changing the

534
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:40,790
game changing the protocol between the environment which is provided the data the learner which

535
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,120
is trying to to infer something from the

536
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,600
why are you doing that because this helps you to come up with different algorithms

537
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:54,290
with different analysis under different function and then going you're going to see now why

538
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,360
this is true

539
00:39:55,370 --> 00:40:00,250
so the idea is that learner in online learning

540
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:08,180
now on the on line x i'm online learning learner

541
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:14,810
are of search

542
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,890
for example

543
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:28,430
for example nothing freeman

544
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,680
with this sequence of of examples which are pairs

545
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,900
of instances and labels

546
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,320
a stream of examples is just possibly

547
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,550
on sequence

548
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,800
a pair of instances and labels

549
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:54,120
which we assume are generated by some devices

550
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:58,870
and we all know about the introduction of this is that this is just an

551
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,310
arbitrary sequence of examples

552
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:08,280
how is the learning rate to interact with the stream

553
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:14,020
so in this argue explaining your protocol of online learning learning

554
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,400
in round

555
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:29,030
because it's online that you're not learning is what not going to get this treatment

556
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:37,220
seems this would be possible but it's gonna get a one example of the time

557
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,770
on each around the

558
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,630
around the

559
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,070
one more about

560
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:01,420
what's going to happen

561
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:12,430
next is the xt is observed

562
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,280
then the prediction

563
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:27,600
it is it

564
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,770
compute the

565
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,570
the prediction is why

566
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:39,850
nine of w minus one

567
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,900
in the brother

568
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:48,200
so what is that even if one is the current mean right

569
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,150
a part of painted by the online learning

570
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:53,850
as it

571
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,140
observe the three k

572
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,420
so you may major in that

573
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,800
there is some initial people

574
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:17,060
initial set of weights that with which the learner starts at the beginning

575
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,320
and then as it goes through the stream

576
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,040
has the chance of

577
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,300
that being the weights

578
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,400
the stream in order to

579
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,610
better classify

580
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,220
for the elements industry

581
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,340
report if you haven't seen it

582
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,640
and are doing business in these five criteria

583
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,760
culture these form microforms

584
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,220
i think how quickly you get to form retail

585
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,160
will really differentiate one developing countries from another

586
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:49,110
the usta further questions really about the poorest countries in the world

587
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,320
and don

588
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:58,700
i've it and other chapters recall flat world they don't understand the world isn't of flat not even close it

589
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,220
intermediaries are

590
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:05,700
four forces at and communities are not in the flat world and that we don't tend to them

591
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,590
on could very much on flat in the world from the inside

592
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,070
the first i simply called to say

593
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:17,510
and that's communities caught in the grip of is worth losses similar and that everything

594
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,320
from rural africa to rural india

595
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,570
rural russia women

596
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,780
parts you know no diving around country to a lesser degree

597
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,110
that just start to sick

598
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,680
on to be able to take part in the world

599
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:34,280
and actually talk about interesting ways of collaboration

600
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:38,070
people are coming up to address some of those problems and talk about the gates

601
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,820
foundation which i think is a very interesting

602
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,220
grand challenges model

603
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,490
a second group called the two unlabelled

604
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,510
again that's rural india rural china and beijing and shanghai depend upon galore

605
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:49,930
seen the riches

606
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:54,490
but they need steps to if they are going to be able to participate in this

607
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:55,930
end on

608
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:01,030
what i talk about areas i'm a big believer that in in in governments that the

609
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,950
every anti-poverty program is run governments

610
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:11,470
and local governments and is really a challenge basically today and go community and anti-globalization

611
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:13,910
movement to make actually local governments

612
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:19,220
focusing on the priority look in india today india nineteen ninety one when they first there

613
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,320
they are open to the world

614
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,590
i had a hundred million dollars in the bank india was going broke to one

615
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,160
can talk about a country that way today india's one hundred twenty billion dollars in

616
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,260
reserves that's the good news the bad news is one hundred thousand rupees allocated from

617
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:34,800
new delhi

618
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,860
the village outside galore

619
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,610
on by the time it gets

620
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,390
down ten thousand rupees

621
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,280
so actually dealing with just the internal change governance

622
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,390
we have a huge impact in building a step stool

623
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,590
for people who want to be in globalization

624
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,860
third group whether two frustrated

625
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,340
on the anatomy is a lot easier most

626
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,590
see what's going on in the flat world they want to be part of it

627
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,610
but still very much left behind

628
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:03,590
and so

629
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,930
two frustrated and the fourth

630
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,260
simply what i call to many toyotas

631
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:13,010
because when the world was flat at three billion people arrived with on god bless

632
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,640
version of the american dream for them how staccato store microwave and a toyota

633
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,110
if we don't find an alternative source of energy we are gonna burn up heat up

634
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,590
this planet faster than any time

635
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,820
in it in the history of our country

636
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,970
end on or we're gonna be in the global struggle with china overall

637
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,130
china's foreign policy is very simple

638
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:38,660
summarized in one sentence taiwan and looking for oil

639
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,950
that's all china's doing

640
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,410
and so on

641
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,180
for understandable reasons and so

642
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:50,590
again get back to their platform can tell you a lot about you know why yes three dollars again

643
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:52,160
so on

644
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:58,390
i don't i don't have a magic cure for any country now but it does

645
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:01,820
seem to me that's what the world bank identified around those issues

646
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,070
on on

647
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,110
of form retailers one

648
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,430
and the other is around how we collaborate

649
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:14,160
with them give a quick example because just important question that a given the book

650
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,090
on each beat very interesting project in india they adopted a village

651
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:23,390
and you know their business and that someone did the work of said you know there's a billion people who

652
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,510
they want to a three dollars a day a lot more than you delivered

653
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,510
fifty and one hundred thousand dollars

654
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,840
and we have to think about how we can actually create products at a profit

655
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,550
there itself so they adopted a village in the book i don't the village in

656
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,700
end they went around the spent six months are just asking people

657
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,140
trying understand what they mean but it was

658
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,970
and one that actually could provide one things they discovered was that

659
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,660
people really needed cameras to take pictures

660
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,410
but then you can rest get license pictures you licenses with an

661
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:58,630
get a picture from license sometimes people would walk all day from one village

662
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,220
to the nearby town that happen photographer

663
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,700
each piece that no problem

664
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:03,910
we do pictures

665
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:04,510
you know

666
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,660
so they said on a given campus you know almond you know those

667
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,840
printers and they can print out pictures no problem then discovered no electricity

668
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:20,130
so they thought about for a while and they said no problem solar-powered

669
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,820
cameras end pretty picture pictures and they developed a mobile

670
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,740
picture by basically photography and print

671
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,140
and they gave it to a women's and go

672
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,180
in this

673
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,510
count fields are working

674
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:36,950
end on

675
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:40,770
they want see you know how they would use weather could produce a business well

676
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:45,360
what they discover for small set just what you know indian villagers like anybody else

677
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:49,970
the last pictures so something they wanted family pictures and you know when pictures and

678
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,890
pictures when the visitor came to town you so that all kinds and

679
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,840
these women developed a great business objectives

680
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:02,010
end on after your age became that's great is so great you go

681
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,260
give us a camera back

682
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,360
and this is what you mean we

683
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:11,840
what are you talking about we've got a business going here you know and on

684
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:14,240
ah it's he said

685
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,280
you can keep the camera if you can come up with a business plan

686
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:19,800
well you will pass

687
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,490
x amount money you know

688
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:25,090
on the paper and inferential they can and they did

689
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,510
and because that's always sustainable is like scale

690
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:29,640
if it's

691
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,630
you know sustainable network

692
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:35,950
as of collaborating there were not just coming so when you people only these this but

693
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:37,320
really getting down

694
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,280
very low

695
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,590
understanding what people need and then trying to design solutions around their life

696
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:43,610
i think that's

697
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,070
it's one of the students you although if you look like this

698
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:57,590
the implications might see while on

699
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,950
that's what i've been here all day you know um

700
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:05,970
really thinking about and then having the pleasure to talk about why i think your

701
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:10,470
you know all the open university you're doing is a really pioneering i think it's

702
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:15,390
incredible and i've really learned more about it today i think it's an enormously powerful

703
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,300
we can draw

704
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,320
a bunch of lines

705
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,760
and that's what these these lines come from here an example that you can you

706
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,010
can try

707
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,390
and there's a few details like kind to the u

708
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,660
you you want to be careful about how you all these lines and you can

709
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:38,160
check this easily by just plotting many line drawings and seeing that there

710
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,760
being generated in the right way

711
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,410
it's easy to

712
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:44,070
it's easy to generate lines in such a way that you

713
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:45,890
actually covering more of the

714
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,370
input space of lines in summary in some regions and other

715
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:52,760
let's assume that we've we've come up with some way of generating lines that we're

716
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,640
happy with it seems to be covering the space that we

717
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,280
the space of decision boundaries

718
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:04,260
uniformly according to what we think is is likely before we see any data

719
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:10,050
all right so we know how to generate lines

720
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,800
now we need to distinguish between lines which seem to be

721
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,590
which seem to be

722
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:21,550
appropriate or consistent in in some way with the data that we that we see

723
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:25,090
so it's introduce new concept of likelihood

724
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,260
given that we have received some data

725
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,470
how likely is it that

726
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:34,140
one particular line is the right line

727
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:36,660
so let's have a simple

728
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,720
measure for this so we've got something which will expresses the probability

729
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:45,430
and i will say

730
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:49,720
well this is essentially saying is that for some line

731
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:54,050
if this line splits of the data perfectly soul yes is are on the positive

732
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,350
side of numbers on the negative side

733
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,590
then that particular line has probability one

734
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,820
and if it doesn't then as probability zero

735
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:05,180
so all that's essentially saying

736
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:09,760
let's generate a whole bunch of line so i think you are generated maybe like

737
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,030
a thousand lines and look at the ones which have probability

738
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,100
probability one

739
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,530
so the ones where all the

740
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:20,350
all the right places on the positive side of the line and all the blue

741
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:24,220
negative side flying

742
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,070
all right so we generated a whole bunch of lines which

743
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,220
which fit

744
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:33,260
so now we've got some choices we could

745
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,050
we could stop that we could take one of the lines around

746
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,320
and say OK all of these

747
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,160
all of these lines

748
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,450
fits our training data in some way so we just we just choose one and

749
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:45,390
that's going to be

750
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:49,850
what we used to distinguish new new test examples

751
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:53,620
or we could

752
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:58,950
all of these lines try to do something else

753
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:03,100
so as to the latter

754
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:06,220
give you another

755
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,700
another concept here which is the use of

756
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,780
the use of bayes rule

757
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,740
to help with this this kind of problems

758
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:18,260
so the bayes rule

759
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:25,120
basic basic property of joint and conditional probabilities

760
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,300
when people talk about bayesian methods the

761
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,990
the the

762
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,240
the inside that's

763
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,330
using is the bayes rule doesn't just have to be

764
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,640
about things statisticians usually call random variables

765
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,910
you could also be reasoning about the probability of different parameters

766
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:44,470
which is a fundamental

767
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:48,930
change in statistical method from from what was classically

768
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:52,450
applied to used to be that premature with some quantity of you can reason about

769
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:55,850
with probabilities but why not let

770
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:59,370
let's give it a shot so if you are interested in the probability

771
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,970
of some parameters

772
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:06,800
given some data

773
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,300
then you can use bayes rule you

774
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,220
look at

775
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,010
the likelihood of

776
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:19,700
different different data points

777
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,510
and you integrate this over

778
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:30,660
so use bayes rule to give you a posterior probability of your

779
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,700
parameter space

780
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:35,800
so having

781
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:40,780
obtain this kind of quantity here which will look at an example of just now

782
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,800
we can then use this to

783
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:46,830
make predictions about new data points

784
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:53,050
if we have a distribution over what we think of parameter should be

785
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:56,870
we've got something which represents the space of all possible lines

786
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,600
and we have some measure

787
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:02,410
of how likely each line is

788
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,280
we can actually use that distribution

789
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,990
to give us

790
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,120
what's called the posterior probability

791
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,120
given the new test data point where we don't know the

792
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,180
class for example

793
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,220
we could say what's the probability

794
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,200
of this test data this acts in the sea

795
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:28,350
a position unlabelled given all the data have seen

796
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,320
here's another application of bayes rule where we

797
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:36,750
during some operations and then going back to this was good for filling in the

798
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,680
missing missing elements with missing data

799
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:42,690
so in some cases you

800
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,670
i alex at something else

801
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,270
OK so

802
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,770
OK so

803
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:03,440
so one day i was this early this intermediate integration you would like to combine

804
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:06,880
come so we have two come

805
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:12,600
so i also talked about generalizing comes and he talked about what the kind learning

806
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,980
so we try to find a linear combination of

807
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,050
so we have these combination coefficients here one

808
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:21,090
which kernel

809
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:24,830
and then i would like to find the optimal combination coefficients and you can do

810
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:30,850
this by selling slightly more complex optimization problems which is called semidefinite programming or second

811
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:34,960
order cone programming and they can find the coefficients

812
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:36,340
alpha coefficients

813
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,540
what pictures

814
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:41,290
and the coefficients what kind of at the same time

815
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:45,390
so it's globally optimal solutions

816
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,840
this is one way of generalizing

817
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,580
another way was to

818
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:56,490
extent can have a joint feature maps so you not only have come on x

819
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,670
the inputs but can't on the output is about

820
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,600
so we include the labels

821
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,080
in the future

822
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,670
and the type function

823
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:13,880
and there different ways of using this point conditional interview or i of about the

824
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,270
maximum margin

825
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:18,030
structured output learning

826
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,500
here the idea is that the

827
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:25,480
try to learn a function f of y given x

828
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:30,600
which scores segmentation why were given x

829
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:35,350
and in this function we can predict label

830
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:40,470
just by maximizing the function of all possible y

831
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:42,970
OK so you have some

832
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:48,450
all possible labellings and just take predict the labelling which has the maximum score

833
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,370
it's one not for training what can we do so we can

834
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:56,930
so we end sequence is a sequence here

835
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:59,390
here the input sequence of the of the

836
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:02,240
and now we would like to f such that

837
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:06,130
the score for the true labeling

838
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:09,760
it's much larger than the score all the wrong labels

839
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:14,310
so compute the difference you have this kind of optimization problems i would like to

840
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:15,880
find the function f

841
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:16,900
such that

842
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:22,180
this difference here this is the score the true labeling minus the score of a

843
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,460
problem labeling

844
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,640
this large so greater than one

845
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:28,130
in a few cases the allowed to be smaller than one

846
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:30,060
but but this the very

847
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,810
and we have one constraints from leaving

848
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,910
because they can be exponentially many different probably

849
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,670
i mean for instance when you consider segmentations of sequences so there might be really

850
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:46,140
i mean different many different possibilities of labour

851
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:48,490
OK so

852
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:52,120
other questions

853
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:56,330
i'm going to use this in the applications later again

854
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,750
so how can we solve these kind of problems so you would like to solve

855
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,120
this now i used actually

856
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:06,880
so here

857
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,330
he we still had the function f in you

858
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:13,550
now i'm using the kernel function the joint feature map between

859
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:18,420
between x and y and the trying to come up with a linear function here

860
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:22,090
and we try to maximize the margin between the true in the wrong

861
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,800
the idea is that the

862
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:28,240
solve the optimisation problem what small set up from labeling

863
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:33,290
it may be just one wrongly leaving in the beginning we solve the optimisation problem

864
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:35,770
this is the number of constraints still small

865
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:38,240
and then

866
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:42,900
using this the solution we can find other constraints other labeling

867
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,190
don't satisfy this constraint

868
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:49,440
so we add one more complex

869
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,490
how to wrap things up

870
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:59,890
this is in the passive learning case basically trying to adapt

871
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:04,630
you're partition to match the boundaries in change points in the image

872
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:10,040
and if that's working well and it was working reasonably well here you can see

873
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,720
that this partition is starting to point us towards where boundaries are and so forth

874
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,760
o thing that comes to mind say well maybe i'll take some

875
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,150
passive data

876
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:24,290
like this one the partition and the partitions starts to tell me where i might

877
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:28,540
want to be taking more samples because it's kind of pointing me towards the boundaries

878
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,370
transitions and change points in the image

879
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:35,110
so that's kind of the idea of how you might do active learning here

880
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:43,800
the passive learning stuff we just some money we get this adaptive partition and now

881
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,900
what we're going to do is we're going to do what i just suggest will

882
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:52,120
take a sort of a random sample

883
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:56,340
our points uniformly across the image and then

884
01:00:56,390 --> 01:01:02,340
device and adapted partition so we split up for simple budget take half samples to

885
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:07,530
find this adaptive partition the next gives us course indication of where

886
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,700
the boundaries in the image and then we're going to do is

887
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,920
only in those boundaries cells

888
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:19,400
with the second half of our sample budget and then apply the same sort of

889
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,810
recursive dyadic partitioning idea

890
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:27,810
within those resampled areas and that allows us to kind of get a refined estimate

891
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,730
of where the boundaries

892
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:36,310
so just by repeating the recursive partitioning idea twice using the first step to kind

893
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:40,390
of give you could indication of where the interesting action in the images in the

894
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:46,340
second step taking additional samples more densely in the region in repeating the kind of

895
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,280
partitioning idea

896
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,940
OK so

897
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:58,230
what does this buy you you can work out an upper bound here

898
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:02,640
for this two-step kind of approach and what you get is

899
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:08,200
ignoring logarithmic factors and their decay rate that's like one over

900
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:11,950
ten to the minus one hundred d minus one plus one over t so we

901
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:13,860
didn't have this one over d

902
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:17,320
this would be one over d minus one which was the minimax rate that we

903
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:22,610
actually determine when we are focusing on the simpler problem of boundary fragments scissors game

904
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:26,670
very close to the best we can hope to do because of boundary fragment cases

905
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:32,460
just to subclass of this more general kind of image processing problem

906
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,180
it turns out also that if you have appeared just two stages but did it

907
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,520
multiple stages you can try to chip away at that

908
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:45,850
one over the there and just get down to an arbitrary epsilon seeking get arbitrarily

909
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:50,200
close to what we know is the minimax lower bound for this class by using

910
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:57,010
this recursive dyadic partitioning procedure in multiple stages coupled with additional resampling in the tiny

911
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:59,920
boxes in the refinement at each step

912
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:05,760
so that's the main result and this was what exactly what we're doing in this

913
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,570
example that i should the first part of the talk we just took random samples

914
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:13,600
there would be are noisy measurements this would be the result you get from the

915
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,610
recursive partitioning algorithm if you

916
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:22,760
half of samples about a thousand randomly get a partition

917
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:27,420
from those use those to help refineries sample more these are the places real go

918
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:32,540
back and some samples per second half of samples the other eight thousand and the

919
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:37,710
resulting image looks like this and so that the kind of points to look at

920
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:42,080
our around the boundary of the lake on the island which are much more resolved

921
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:47,230
in the adaptive method and they are in the non adaptive approach

922
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,510
and this is the real

923
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:55,760
have first application of this is something called ballistic imaging this is where you're shining

924
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,020
l a laser through

925
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:03,620
scattering medium and what's going to happen is you're going trying to detect the shape

926
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,930
and presence of the computer in this has

927
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:13,940
many applications in bio bio imaging and so forth this is the simulated experimental stated

928
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:18,120
where they put a small excluding object more shining a laser through the scattering medium

929
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:22,570
and then trying to figure out where and what the shape that object was if

930
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:28,590
you just risk and uniformly with your laser raster scanned across the field of view

931
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:30,630
the result you get this

932
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:37,550
this reconstruction of that whereas if you take a scanning and lower resolution and then

933
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:40,040
go back to refine you can get much

934
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:44,860
better estimates this is this idea is actually something people have tried use in various

935
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:52,400
one of the last syllables segments of the

936
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:59,400
the trio is on the question of how do humans use active learning and as

937
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,120
i mentioned at the beginning

938
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:05,050
in terms of things like vision and so forth it's known that people

939
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:11,440
are obviously doing something very active and selective about how they focus their attention and

940
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:11,940
so forth

941
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:15,850
and what we want to try to see is in the context of the problem

942
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,540
where that we understand very well mathematically characterized these

943
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:25,480
you bounds on the sample complexity and so forth can we see if humans come

944
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,400
because the light of the stars outshines

945
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,980
the planets planets shine and so the only way to see the planets is vs

946
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:39,650
weak gravitational effect they give on on their host stars

947
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:46,400
but this is not my main point because because we see that the only indication

948
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:51,190
mark there's a lot of that matter that is that there is not made of

949
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:54,440
stuff that makes up some plants

950
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:58,870
so the way to get to that is to define what is called a master

951
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:03,000
so in the solar system the master light ratio

952
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:07,270
it's not too high because most of the mass in the solar system is in

953
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:11,470
the sun anyway with some more small corrections to jupiter and you can forget about

954
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,890
everything that

955
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:17,990
but let's look at galaxies and this is the only major of the optical light

956
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:19,680
of our galaxy

957
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:21,510
galaxies are rotating

958
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:28,780
and if you could actually not seat in the optical light but see it guys

959
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:33,970
and you could see through the twenty one centimeter line of hydrogen

960
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,470
then you would see

961
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:39,010
that you know if the optical light is the size of about ten killer part

962
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:44,060
six the gas extends out to work at least the for thinking about six away

963
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:50,220
but the cool thing you can do is that you can measure the rotation curve

964
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:56,570
of this stuff because remember velocities are relatively easy to measure the doppler shift

965
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,200
and so all

966
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,240
if you can do that you can try to wait

967
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:02,420
a deluxe

968
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,210
so how do you go

969
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:07,980
well from companies and you don't know the rotational speed of an atom of gas

970
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:12,910
around the galaxy is given by this simple equation with this now members is the

971
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:16,670
period is not the pressure anymore because we're talking about capitalist equation here

972
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:20,440
and and this is a now here is the same e major axis of the

973
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:24,980
orbit is not the scale factor of the universe so just for this transparency but

974
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:30,440
run out of symbols and so if they are some model it sequel and then

975
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:34,390
this is the radius of the circle called are and then you can write a

976
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:39,100
couple of seconds lowland at the speed is constant the so this is the speed

977
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:43,750
and then you put this together and you end up that the master that is

978
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:49,110
campaigning to save the galaxy is that the proportional to the velocity squared times the

979
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:59,420
so according to newton's law once you are outside the galaxy the rotation velocity of

980
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:02,830
the gas should decrease with distance

981
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:07,220
because of the massive them up if there's no more mass and you increase the

982
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,560
induced velocity should decrease

983
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:13,710
unfortunately this is not what it says so

984
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:16,650
so if you blocked they

985
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:18,710
distance from the centre of

986
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:20,050
any galaxy

987
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:25,890
versus the rotational velocity you will find that almost all four of galaxies in this

988
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:28,960
tradition goes goes up as solution

989
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:34,150
until you get to one the light say well like these and then you know

990
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:39,210
if you say there's no more stuff where there's no more light than they should

991
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:40,460
go down

992
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,710
but it remains constant

993
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:46,920
so this kind of shape is called the flat rotation curves

994
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,760
and this is an indication that there must be a lot of mass in the

995
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,690
outer region of our galaxy the we kind of search

996
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,040
well there's no more like no more stuff

997
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:59,700
and so like this you can commute what is called the mass to light ratio

998
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:03,320
and this is telling you already there a lot more than meets the eye and

999
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:08,450
galaxy must allow iteration must be higher than one

1000
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:10,330
and this is called dark matter

1001
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:11,690
and so

1002
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:16,970
the twenty spiral galaxies have this flat rotation curve and i talk about spiral galaxy

1003
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:20,250
because spiral galaxies have or are

1004
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,870
annotation pattern that you can actually measure

1005
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:27,510
if they are not spiral and they didn't get the motion of the gas service

1006
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,370
that is a little bit more kartik then you need to do something that contradicts

1007
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:36,070
but you can do so so basically all these galaxies to this latter rotation curves

1008
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:38,870
so this is not the flow

1009
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,470
and we

1010
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:42,910
queen we this is due

1011
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:46,930
to the work of erwin and this is where i been in the seventies also

1012
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:52,670
embedding these nodes using some spectrum at that you can use and sort of other

1013
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:58,040
types of things or for example what preferential would correspond to would be the product

1014
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:01,750
of the degrees of the endpoints of the edge right that is sort of probability

1015
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:05,530
of an edge is proportional to the product of the degrees of the nodes of

1016
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:10,430
the nodes and sort of one the main finding is the following so here are

1017
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:13,620
all the different methods and this is the

1018
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:19,760
improvement over the baseline killer the baselines and here the baseline is a shortest path

1019
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:25,040
distance between the set of between a pair of nodes the error bars actually the

1020
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:28,630
the best and the worst case so i'm not standard deviations but this is maximum

1021
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:34,950
this is minimum and its averaged over all five basically maximum improvement improvement over those

1022
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,070
five datasets i showed and what is interesting is that

1023
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,490
sort of this simple

1024
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:44,120
many that they showed they were sort of much better than random

1025
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:50,530
what i'm what i'm selecting here is for example if you are predicting the

1026
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:54,660
edge based on just the number of common neighbors the nodes have you're doing sort

1027
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,330
of quite well

1028
01:10:56,330 --> 01:11:00,670
and here also write you like doing thirty times as good as and

1029
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:07,580
if you are using some kind of low rank approximation so the idea is to

1030
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:12,090
do SVD PCA on the graph adjacency matrix and then and then when you want

1031
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:16,130
to this embedded nodes in its in you know some k

1032
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:19,760
k dimensional space and then just use the inner product this as an ocean whether

1033
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:25,590
the nodes closer not then that gives you sort of very surprisingly little improvement even

1034
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:29,920
here the graph was embedded in like i think one of each other's embedded in

1035
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:35,530
like one thousand dimensional space for each node was described by one thousand dimensional vector

1036
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:37,790
and what seems to work best

1037
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,800
is this not this measure

1038
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:46,350
damage about which i said is basically just the common frog common friends but this

1039
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:49,110
common friends are weighted by by the degree

1040
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:54,630
right and this seems to sort of be the best heuristics to predict the edges

1041
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,990
the new edges in the network so this is sort of the first thing i

1042
01:11:56,990 --> 01:12:00,200
wanted to show just how you can go about these just you know given the

1043
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:05,530
network structure somehow quantify the distance between the nodes and the closer the nodes i

1044
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,090
the more

1045
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:11,870
you predict amoz oz very that the edge will occur so this was one this

1046
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:12,760
is an now

1047
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:16,890
a completely different approach so here the idea is to model the network of some

1048
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:18,320
kind of hierarchy

1049
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:25,630
what we have is hammer three dendrogram where leaves of this tree they will correspond

1050
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,130
to the nodes in the network

1051
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:32,460
and each node we have like a bernoulli parameter that probability of an edge and

1052
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:38,300
then given two nodes the probability of the edge is basically the parameter that is

1053
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:41,950
in the car least common ancestor in the three so

1054
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,750
here's an example of this is my dendrogram

1055
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,920
the shades here i mean the value of five so that means very high white

1056
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:55,160
means low and now it's so for example this dendrogram could generate the network like

1057
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:59,990
that right so the idea is that the nodes one and two are not likely

1058
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,540
to be connected but for example what you know this one and this one very

1059
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:09,170
hot likely to be connected because this is the least common ancestor

1060
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,460
right so

1061
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:16,420
what i want to do then is given a network i want to estimate such

1062
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:19,680
the and this parameters inside the tree

1063
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:24,830
just to give some intuition here examples right so even if this is the network

1064
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:28,420
i get that i would have a hierarchy like that right this is a random

1065
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:32,970
graph so there's no hierarchy so all nodes you know joined the same the same

1066
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:34,830
level if i would have this

1067
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:40,710
you know three clusters then i this this would correspond to the clusters and then

1068
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:44,760
they are joined on top so these three parameters would probably be the same here

1069
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:49,430
and then than the edges across i wouldn't want them in in this in an

1070
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:51,510
old and then if i have

1071
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:56,170
like sort of hierarchical structure like that you know this cluster then can be separated

1072
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:59,420
into different ones then i can model this in

1073
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:02,200
using for example of such a hierarchy OK

1074
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:06,070
so just to show you how how to estimate the model

1075
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:10,000
so if you give me a graph and you give me a model i computing

1076
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,110
like which is very easy so probability of a graph given y given by the

1077
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,330
these these demands

1078
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:23,080
basically all i go i just go over all the the the nodes in the

1079
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:25,070
and i multiply

1080
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:26,330
the number of

1081
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:30,700
of edges go between these two sort of subtrees and and then

1082
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:34,380
the rest of what you just did not occur that sort of i'm assuming that

1083
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:38,180
the edges between different parts of the substrate occur and so this is just the

1084
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:40,130
number of successes number of failures

1085
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:43,760
right and l and i is the number of nodes in the left part of

1086
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,500
the subject in the right part of the sub is the number of edges that

1087
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:50,850
occurred between these two parts of subtrees so here's an example if i have a

1088
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:51,870
graph like this

1089
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,000
and they have a dendrogram like that

1090
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:57,260
then the likelihood of these dendrogram

1091
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,740
you know i can simply calculated to say

1092
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:03,880
here the probabilities one because i have an edge

1093
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:10,250
also here the probability is one but here it's one third because between between this

1094
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:14,210
part of the in this part of the sub TOC one edge so i wanted

1095
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:15,370
to power one

1096
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:20,290
but because it's three versus one i could have just so i have to two-thirds

1097
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:21,140
i have to

1098
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,530
power to right

1099
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:25,000
similarly here

1100
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,290
where i'm getting no similarly calculating the likelihood is easy

1101
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:33,500
the only sort of long one term is this one when i have three guys

1102
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:37,630
here in three is here so the number of possible edges nine i get to

1103
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:41,040
se one one edge between this part of the up in that part of the

1104
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:43,710
out of nine OK

1105
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,040
so that's how i can calculate the likelihood

1106
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:50,960
and what they can do then i can do i can learn that using magic

1107
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:55,370
which in one the carbon that basically you find local moves on this structure where

1108
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:59,450
the the idea is that each node can be each node in the tree can

1109
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:01,540
be in one of these three states

1110
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:05,410
and then what i can do is i can sort of the nodes in this

1111
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:09,170
sort of thing is if the current configuration is like that the i day night

1112
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,140
this then i what they do that is by either

1113
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:16,410
change appeared to correspond to this configuration of that configuration and then based on the

1114
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:21,460
likelihood ratio of the likelihoods i basically except this change right so the idea is

1115
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:26,490
something seriously like his friend he runs into the wall and then falls down and

1116
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:31,240
breaks like that if i write at least it would become

1117
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:38,050
so in another area is adaptive input devices sold

1118
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:44,490
if you consider computer game than really

1119
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:48,560
there we have means of the computer communicating to us

1120
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:50,740
what the state of the game is

1121
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:54,200
you know we have sound we have graphics and and all of these things but

1122
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,780
our way of telling the computer what we actually want to do is much more

1123
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:01,830
limited it used to be these joysticks another card game pads

1124
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:07,100
which is essentially two joysticks and a few more buttons and some people play first-person

1125
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,510
shooters with the mouse

1126
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:13,300
and the keyboard which looks very funny to the uninitiated someone to you know to

1127
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,330
tapping away at the keyboard at the same time doing stuff with the mouse and

1128
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:21,460
essentially trying to get the mouse pointer over the heads of opponents and click because

1129
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:27,520
the tension it can look very strange if you don't know what's going on

1130
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:30,950
so clearly here's a potential

1131
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:37,780
four for adaptive techniques to improve this way of how people communicate with the computer

1132
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:41,350
that's true not only for games of course that's true for for any kind of

1133
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:48,600
human computer interaction but it is particularly strong requirement in games because he big band

1134
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,900
with took two to control games if you type the text that that works quite

1135
01:17:52,900 --> 01:18:00,160
well with the keyboard but to control various degrees of freedom off of your character

1136
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:07,260
using using a mouse and a keyboard or using a game pad much harder so

1137
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:10,470
talk about some some aspects of this

1138
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:16,960
the one that i found was dialogue generation so if you that there are many

1139
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:21,850
games three of these dialogues and you would like them to be in the more

1140
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:27,810
flexible than just always getting the same answer all the same options the speech recognition

1141
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:32,650
another interesting aspect is data from online play because we can connect the lot of

1142
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,580
interesting data from people playing online

1143
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:41,130
and this section there's game based on machine learning who make the very notion of

1144
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:43,920
learning central topic of the game

1145
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:49,650
so i go through a few more these in detail so

1146
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:51,180
if you use

1147
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:57,050
probably you know this game nineteen seventy seven space invaders

1148
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:00,030
i q believe

1149
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,740
i q believe

1150
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:07,280
nothing much has changed

1151
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:12,780
we still have a human players

1152
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,560
at the bottom of the screen

1153
01:19:14,610 --> 01:19:18,720
we still have non-player characters

1154
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:22,480
and we still have humans trying to

1155
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:25,000
she aliens from the sky

1156
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:30,350
why right now

1157
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:37,390
i know there are a few sports games i think it

1158
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:45,190
let me point out some of the problems in current AI and illustrate that one

1159
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:51,880
problem is that the behaviour of MPC's those and non-playing characters are currently fixed development

1160
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:56,730
time and actually this is strong driving force behind that because

1161
01:19:56,740 --> 01:20:01,190
i don't know if you know about the model in games programming but there are

1162
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:03,270
programmers and their designers

1163
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:05,590
and their testers but there are of game

1164
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:13,520
so the designers are control freaks i mean these guys want to know exactly what's

1165
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,100
going on then they want to be able to exactly saying what's going on and

1166
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,190
so they love this

1167
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:26,030
i want to know this guy crosses the street at exactly this point in time

1168
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:32,070
and you know my my test gamers told me that this is great every single

1169
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:35,950
time and so i want change and

1170
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:38,330
if you want to create interesting interesting

1171
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:43,560
the results of this policy unit at least a huge amount of rules that you

1172
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:50,130
put into the system so that there's a certain at least solution of variability

1173
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:54,910
and of course anyone who has worked with large rule sets knows that their first

1174
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:58,820
very hard to design and input and once you have them and you want to

1175
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:02,530
extend them or you want to change when they are very hard to change because

1176
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:07,720
what happens is that they conflict in certain situations and you put in your rule

1177
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:12,230
in you thought you had started through enough but you hadn't and suddenly the whole

1178
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:18,150
system goes crazy and s things yet you never expected and then this guy from

1179
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:23,310
the first points comes up so i didn't expect that and so it's very hard

1180
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:28,750
so of course you get very adaptive and emergent behavior you can of course write

1181
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:33,060
and that's again with the guy from number one the designer hates motor behavior terrible

1182
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:37,820
suddenly something happens that i plan and

1183
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:41,900
there's another aspect which is quite interesting

1184
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:47,560
because it's so hard to script good or interesting behaviour which is also

1185
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:50,040
place these games well

1186
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:55,990
what often happens is is that these characters don't work on the same conditions as

1187
01:21:55,990 --> 01:22:00,950
humans do something more no more they know you're coming around the corner or they

1188
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:06,430
have this magical ability of getting their weapon exactly you had

1189
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:09,240
and it takes no time and they can trigger and

1190
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:16,380
you right so this is something sometimes very frustrating and sometimes they even have different

1191
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:21,020
laws of physics if you believe it or not these racing games and it's not

1192
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:24,850
so easy to keep the cars on the track well it is easy if you're

1193
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:30,530
on rails right there not visible but it's often what happens in these racing games

1194
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:35,720
that they the cars are not subject to the the cars controlled by the computer

1195
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:41,480
are not subject to the same physics system that the human drivers car subjected to

1196
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:46,630
so sometimes you think you're driving this core curve in an optimal way and suddenly

1197
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:47,750
you know this

1198
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:50,850
train comes i and overtakes him

1199
01:22:50,890 --> 01:22:55,000
and well i don't have to point out that all of this is of course

1200
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,790
inherently different from human intelligence but that's

1201
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:02,300
that's probably another matter so

1202
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:08,260
i think the examples actually pick one from our one from our company and one

1203
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:14,430
from sunnyside so to balance this of really stupid behaviour of AI

1204
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:18,830
so this is a fighting game called tangles

1205
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:24,040
and so the idea of fighting game is pretty simple just another word for it

1206
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:28,210
it will become clear they also called them beat them up games

1207
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:34,830
and that pretty much says it usually these easter martial arts inspired characters

1208
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:40,630
fighting against each other and you have control map to your controller and different things

1209
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:44,610
exon exon that's the textbook fifth edition

1210
01:23:47,070 --> 01:23:51,590
well you'll notice is thank you very much for your notices this and this and

1211
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:53,280
went back up to

1212
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,450
this is something automatic

1213
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:58,950
instinctive and does not require your brain

1214
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:02,130
so your brain is needed for everything

1215
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:06,570
what does your brain do well some things that your brain does involve very low

1216
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:08,720
level internal structures

1217
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:15,950
and these are called subcortical structures because they below the cortex there underneath the cortex

1218
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:18,740
so for instance what we have here is

1219
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:23,420
a diagram of the brain way to read this diagram is is therefore my brain

1220
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:24,880
facing this way

1221
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,720
my head gets cut in half

1222
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:29,320
down here

1223
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,280
and then you can see

1224
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,180
the brain

1225
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:34,820
so this is the front over here that's the back

1226
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,050
some key parts are illustrated here

1227
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:41,030
the mid-to-upper for instance is

1228
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:42,680
responsible for

1229
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,220
heart rate and respiration

1230
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:49,280
it's very deep within the brain and if it gets damaged you but you're likely

1231
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:49,930
to die

1232
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:51,990
the cerebellum

1233
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:56,280
it is responsible for body balance and muscular coordination

1234
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,590
and to give you an idea

1235
01:24:57,610 --> 01:25:04,430
a feeling for the complexity of these systems the cerebellum contains approximately thirty billion neurons

1236
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:09,320
the hypothalamus is responsible here for feeding hunger

1237
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:12,990
first and to some extent sleep

1238
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:15,110
and here's is the same brain parts

1239
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,680
in closer

1240
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:23,700
all of these parts of the brains are essential and many of them are implicated

1241
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,900
interesting psychological processes

1242
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:28,240
but where the action is

1243
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:30,260
is the cortex

1244
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:31,570
it is beautiful

1245
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:35,610
the cortex is the outer layer

1246
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:38,090
and the outer layer is all crumpled up

1247
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:40,660
you wonder why your brain with wrinkles

1248
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,840
that's because it's all crumble

1249
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:46,900
if you took out somebody's cortex

1250
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:49,090
and flatten the

1251
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:51,130
it would be two feet square

1252
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:53,160
so like in a helical rod

1253
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:56,740
the cortex

1254
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:58,530
is where all the needs to

1255
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:02,070
takes place fish don't have any event

1256
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:05,430
so no offense to fish within the fish don't have much of the mental life

1257
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:10,470
reptiles and birds have a little bit about it a bit and primates have long

1258
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:12,860
and humans have a real life

1259
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:17,760
eighty percent of the volume of our brain about his cortex

1260
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:20,490
in the cortex

1261
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:23,380
can be broken up into different parts

1262
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:25,900
or lobes

1263
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,220
there's the again this is facing

1264
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:29,920
in profile forward

1265
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:34,840
the frontal lobe easy to remember it is hard front

1266
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:37,840
the parietal lobe and occipital lobe

1267
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,380
and the temporal lobe

1268
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:45,530
and one thing we're going to return to is this is half the brain

1269
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:47,700
it's this is in fact

1270
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,570
the left hand of the brain

1271
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:53,780
another at the right hand everything's duplicated

1272
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:57,700
with some slight subtle differences

1273
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:02,470
what's really weird one really we're finding about these lobes

1274
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:05,820
is that include topological maps

1275
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,110
they include maps of your body

1276
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,220
here's the cartoon

1277
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:13,240
which actually illustrates the classic experiment

1278
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:16,860
by some physiologist who for some reason had

1279
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:19,090
had the dog's brain open

1280
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:22,680
and started shocking different parts of the brain you could do brain surgery while fully

1281
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:26,900
conscious because the brain itself has no sense organs to it

1282
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:30,400
and it turns out the dog one is that part of its brain is labelled

1283
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,740
and it took doctor penfield

1284
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,610
mcgill university

1285
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:38,650
to do the same thing with people

1286
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:41,240
so you're doing some brain surgery

1287
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:44,930
he had all electrical thing on i don't know how to do this these are

1288
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:46,090
the zapping

1289
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:47,050
and both

1290
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:50,090
the person is parts are body with

1291
01:27:50,110 --> 01:27:52,050
more than that

1292
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:56,280
when is that other parts of the brain people would claim to see colors

1293
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:00,990
in these and other parts of the brain people claim to hear sounds

1294
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:04,070
in other parts of the brain people would claim

1295
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:06,780
two experienced up

1296
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:08,950
and through his research

1297
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:13,640
this is all on carbon have formed anyone's yet

1298
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:18,700
but now what i'm going to do is i'm going to take these four functions

1299
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:23,020
they're all on the same carbon right

1300
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:30,490
but i'm going to let those four wavefunctions constructively and destructively interfere

1301
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:36,100
so now i'm taking the wave functions on the same area

1302
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:41,990
and letting them constructively and destructively interfere in molecular orbital theory

1303
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:45,850
we took the away functions on different atoms

1304
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:51,520
and let them constructively and destructively interfere this is going to be taking away functions

1305
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,450
on the same atom

1306
01:28:53,490 --> 01:28:58,490
and letting them constructively and destructively interfere

1307
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,780
when i do this

1308
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,630
what you're going to get

1309
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:06,200
is something that looks like this

1310
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:10,500
you're going to get four different weight functions

1311
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:11,980
that we're going to call

1312
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:13,110
the sp

1313
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:15,320
three wavefunctions the

1314
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:18,320
he three orbitals

1315
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:21,030
more precisely they are the

1316
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:27,070
four sp three hybrid wavefunctions or hybrid orbitals

1317
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:33,490
because they are the linear combination is constructed over there

1318
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,710
of these four different wave functions

1319
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:39,060
right on the same carbon in

1320
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:40,210
to make

1321
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:47,460
four equivalent wavefunctions hybrid way functions that we call this the freeway functions

1322
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:48,510
they all look

1323
01:29:48,530 --> 01:29:54,530
the same year just oriented in space a little differently

1324
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:56,900
i understand there

1325
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:59,250
and it's not clear i know

1326
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:03,130
we're looking at this how they get like that

1327
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:05,840
but here's one

1328
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:08,660
a simple way to look at one of these

1329
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,440
take this to us wavefunctions

1330
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:19,540
and let it constructively and destructively interfere with two PC wave function

1331
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,750
so this

1332
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:24,270
here is essentially a topic here

1333
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:28,200
what you notice that the two peasy function is that this part of the wave

1334
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:35,750
is that a positive amplitude remember we talked about the positive sign and one of

1335
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:39,510
these little meaning positive amplitude

1336
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:41,780
and this part of the wave function

1337
01:30:41,830 --> 01:30:46,700
if the negative sign is the negative amplitude

1338
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:52,130
but the two as function here has the positive amplitude everywhere

1339
01:30:52,970 --> 01:30:56,510
so if we put the two s on top here

1340
01:30:56,530 --> 01:30:58,820
well you can see there right here

1341
01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:00,100
we're going to have

1342
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:01,600
two positive

1343
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:08,220
the amplitude two ways there are positive there that constructively interfere in the result is

1344
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:12,350
about year right here just these two look at this

1345
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:16,530
you can have a lot of wavefunction right up here

1346
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:21,610
below this plane where we have the positive weight function

1347
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:25,030
at the same time we have a negative weight function

1348
01:31:25,050 --> 01:31:26,460
well you know what

1349
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:32,090
this is destructive interference and the result is that the wave function here

1350
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:35,650
is going to be pretty small it's going to be a little negative

1351
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:37,990
but it's going to be pretty small

1352
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:43,680
right so that's probably the simplest just example to look at so that you understand

1353
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:47,490
how i get from here to here

1354
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:55,810
so we're going to form these four sp three weight function now

1355
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:57,840
here's a picture of

1356
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:01,220
so when i take

1357
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:06,490
these four wave functions which are all i've just separated them out in space

1358
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:09,990
but now i'm really just to put them on top of each other because they

1359
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:12,820
really all have the same origin here

1360
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:14,590
when i do that

1361
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:19,050
function kind looks like this

1362
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:20,490
where these

1363
01:32:20,490 --> 01:32:23,740
walls here are the positive parts

1364
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:26,290
are my ISP three function

1365
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:31,050
loans landing becomes more easy this of course is pro-cyclical meaning

1366
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:35,130
more money and liquidity support to the thing and of course the money has to

1367
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:38,030
go somewhere so it feels the or even more

1368
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,290
the fourth stage

1369
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:42,230
these very weak coupling

1370
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:44,130
between the market

1371
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:46,340
and the fundamental c

1372
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:48,710
and the first stage

1373
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:55,010
the problem is that these are drying phase of liquidity eventually the system is finite

1374
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:57,850
there's no more new investors you've tried out

1375
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,280
but then show investors even from abroad

1376
01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:06,410
and then that's when you reach this very unstable phase and here i just copied

1377
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:08,410
we don't need to read through it but basically

1378
01:33:08,510 --> 01:33:13,060
try asking the burger has this famous book in seventy eight where he doesn't and

1379
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:15,930
it's very very detailed is to recover

1380
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:19,240
a review of some of the major crashes over

1381
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:21,300
the story of financial economics

1382
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:24,330
and basically go through the same conclusions

1383
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:30,020
and he actually was a even more the irrationality i wouldn't go as far as

1384
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:34,970
together form is more rational imitation learning process

1385
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:38,630
we're collectively was tend to forget chris breaks risks

1386
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:41,090
you know way that leads to these axes

1387
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,100
so having

1388
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:49,370
the suggestion that they similar the phenomenon from a quantitative point of view let's go

1389
01:33:49,370 --> 01:33:54,530
to the second question of why is it so difficult to identify and i want

1390
01:33:54,530 --> 01:33:55,720
to contrast the

1391
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:58,400
academic view with the practice of you wonder

1392
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:01,380
the reserve one i think one that so explanation

1393
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:04,330
i want to suggest two of them

1394
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:06,960
three of them one is

1395
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:11,810
many of the terms to explain

1396
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:15,920
o crashed and you see that they put crashes as a can of dual version

1397
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,160
of the bible says close association

1398
01:34:18,170 --> 01:34:19,220
that people are

1399
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:22,090
often tend to look at approximate causes

1400
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,560
crash occurs today

1401
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:29,190
what happened yesterday what the call what what could have happened the week before so

1402
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:30,330
we look at this

1403
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,040
proximate explanation

1404
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:34,830
and i think the difficulty with that is of course you have so many new

1405
01:34:34,830 --> 01:34:38,310
as you so my list for the crash of eighty seven

1406
01:34:38,330 --> 01:34:39,540
people have

1407
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:45,100
but for so many explanation for example i can refer to the presidential

1408
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:51,530
that was put created under the reagan administration with reagan

1409
01:34:51,570 --> 01:34:53,920
yet committee

1410
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:56,490
after the october nineteen eighty seven crash

1411
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:59,970
famous economist if you know the prize winner nobel prize

1412
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:04,060
try to understand what the cause

1413
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:08,730
some efficient market hypothesis returned wall and so on and

1414
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:12,150
they agree completely with you all the reports different

1415
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:13,940
the only consensus

1416
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,440
it was a paper by

1417
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:16,860
child who

1418
01:35:16,890 --> 01:35:19,720
do the world wide analysis and concluded

1419
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:25,270
the only statistically significant explanation for this crash

1420
01:35:25,290 --> 01:35:27,630
one line

1421
01:35:27,650 --> 01:35:32,130
was that the global world market has crashed

1422
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:32,900
so let me

1423
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:37,440
explain the crash in the US is due to the wall crash crash of that

1424
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,500
band is due to the war crash

1425
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,840
and so on and so forth

1426
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:45,400
so what is the reason for the war crash not not it the factor analysis

1427
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:50,070
for those who are in this phase they found that the only relevant factor is

1428
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:51,960
the worst crash

1429
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:55,270
is that a good explanation interest to global public

1430
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:59,130
and i think the reason

1431
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:00,940
two for this lack of

1432
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,730
ax access to define is that

1433
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,650
we don't recognise enough

1434
01:36:05,650 --> 01:36:09,860
the crash in and now i'm going to try to substantiate this claim

1435
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,340
it is the revelation

1436
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:15,590
of instability that has been progressively developing the system

1437
01:36:15,610 --> 01:36:17,750
over the development of the

1438
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:19,690
so an instability we know from

1439
01:36:19,770 --> 01:36:25,250
lot of mathematical study is tested in different fields is characterized did with the growing

1440
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:29,090
two external perturbations so in the end

1441
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:32,860
proposition of approximate goes

1442
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,040
we can correct

1443
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:37,150
but this is not giving an insight because

1444
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:40,670
in the same way that might offend going down

1445
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:44,790
may go down make crash the table because there was so something

1446
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:46,590
incorrect initial conditions

1447
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:52,150
some sort of air that's approximate cause the final causes what it was prepared in

1448
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:56,130
situation so that we we're trying to do is to try to understand what are

1449
01:36:56,130 --> 01:37:01,710
the mechanisms to understand the nurturing of the market in two

1450
01:37:01,770 --> 01:37:02,900
and stable

1451
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:11,790
let me come back to the review of this economist at the beginning of concluded

1452
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:12,770
that for

1453
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:16,270
or in the papers to conclude about above all there is another paper that concluded

1454
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:19,500
that there is no problem because you can explain it according to

1455
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,210
from the evaluation and

1456
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:24,790
this goes back to you know models of girls

1457
01:37:24,790 --> 01:37:27,980
and here i'm looking at one of growth of population but the same thing for

1458
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:31,860
where you have this population growth

1459
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:32,810
and the

1460
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:34,630
which was proposed by matters

1461
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:39,440
and who led to piece of this simplistic economies to conclude that

1462
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:44,630
the worst was going to happen to mankind because of the overpopulation of exponential growth

1463
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:47,190
OK but the malthusian you

1464
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:54,770
the first generalize this equation by saying well but these actually a saturation effect

1465
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:57,500
but what is the the maximum entropy

1466
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:01,870
what is the maximum differential entropy to be more precise

1467
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:07,250
so you can write that you can write that entropy

1468
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:16,250
their relative entropy of the distribution with respect to the gaussians distribution

1469
01:38:16,270 --> 01:38:19,120
that has the same second order statistics

1470
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,500
the gaussians

1471
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:24,020
that same gaussian distributions

1472
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:25,770
with respect to

1473
01:38:25,790 --> 01:38:27,600
i gaussian distributions

1474
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:31,000
that's what i mean by this a gaussian distribution that is

1475
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:32,790
i i d

1476
01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:36,160
OK so

1477
01:38:36,170 --> 01:38:40,160
in the in the absence of any

1478
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:41,520
other knowledge

1479
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:48,660
before you know they are the second order order statistics then by maximizing this with

1480
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:53,120
respect to px what you're doing is you're making this equal to see you said

1481
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:58,350
you're making the px equal to the gaussians that has

1482
01:38:58,370 --> 01:39:02,230
by the same second second order statistics

1483
01:39:02,230 --> 01:39:03,640
OK then what you're

1484
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:08,870
what you're left with is with this is the

1485
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:10,960
no the

1486
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,710
the relative entropy of the gaussians with a given

1487
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:20,060
second order statistics in the idea so in other words what this is doing is

1488
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:24,040
or saying well

1489
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:25,690
i would like to

1490
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:28,870
to view reality in the closest way

1491
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:33,040
to the simplest possible explanation the simplest possible explanation being

1492
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:39,310
something being i i d gaussians and my observations what is the closest explanation of

1493
01:39:39,310 --> 01:39:42,290
my observations to that pure reality

1494
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:46,020
that's the maximum entropy principle

1495
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:53,440
now another very interesting use for nongaussianness this

1496
01:39:53,460 --> 01:40:00,940
is essentially the central limit theorem but the non asymptotic version of the central limit

1497
01:40:00,940 --> 01:40:03,080
theorem so what i mean by that

1498
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:07,020
you take any

1499
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:12,310
prose probability density function new coevolving with itself and you normalise it so that we

1500
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:18,270
you keep the variance the same you started which looks more around

1501
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:21,420
you do it again it looks even more and then you know what's going to

1502
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:24,310
happen it's going to become more money

1503
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:30,900
so shannon actually nineteen forty eight show

1504
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:34,330
and then when you do this process

1505
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:39,690
once so you take our PDF with with itself

1506
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:45,960
you turn it indeed into more gulshan looking around the bible and when i say

1507
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:49,690
more gumption looking around the bible he did it through the differential entropy

1508
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:53,960
and that's what he called the entropy power inequality

1509
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:57,310
actually he did prove that the entropy power inequality that took

1510
01:40:57,330 --> 01:41:00,520
quite a bit of effort but ten years later

1511
01:41:02,690 --> 01:41:04,040
for a long time

1512
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:09,940
even though you know it's very

1513
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:14,440
of a simple thing to conjecture from time

1514
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:20,460
it was an open problem to show that at each step that nongaussian this that

1515
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,390
relative entropy with respect to the gaussian distribution

1516
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:29,580
actually is monotonically decreasing and of course by doing this and you can prove

1517
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:34,850
central limit theorem so it's like a strong form of the central limit theorem

1518
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:40,480
provided of course that to start with the PDS if you'd understand with the pdfs

1519
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:45,480
then i it is that you have a discrete distribution and is always infinity

1520
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:51,250
the discrete distribution then it's going to have infinite relative entropy with respect to the

1521
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:53,670
ocean even though of course we know

1522
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:58,620
then the characteristic functions are going to converge

1523
01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:04,310
OK so this was actually finally shown in to the force in functional analysis in

1524
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:10,140
two thousand four that we came up with a much simpler proof

1525
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:18,390
based on the connection between information theory and estimation theory that we will see later

1526
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:21,290
in some detail

1527
01:42:21,290 --> 01:42:28,730
OK so what you're doing here what you're doing here in there

1528
01:42:28,730 --> 01:42:35,980
in the world of distributions with a given variants

1529
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:40,850
and two-sided distributions you could think of doing this in other words

1530
01:42:40,850 --> 01:42:46,120
you could think of doing this say for example in the world of distributions that

1531
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:48,210
the were but it gets fragmented

1532
01:42:48,230 --> 01:42:51,680
so that even an order traversal of the trie

1533
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:53,960
hands up doing lots of disk seeks

1534
01:42:54,110 --> 01:42:56,210
six slow

1535
01:42:56,210 --> 01:42:57,430
sikhs are

1536
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:01,830
well let's let's look at some numbers

1537
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:02,890
if you

1538
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:07,420
i mean to give you some some sort of ballpark figures of what hard disk

1539
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:11,660
this these days correctly transferred ten megabytes per second

1540
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,970
it takes roughly ten million seconds to seek the drive a sort of the constants

1541
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:17,070
that we have to deal with

1542
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:21,420
and generally we're dealing with the structures that are larger than the memory that need

1543
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:23,140
to be on disk

1544
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,810
the question is whether we better off

1545
01:43:27,860 --> 01:43:30,870
if we got some number of updates to some large database

1546
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:33,390
what we're better off using the tree

1547
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:34,760
we we have to do is seek

1548
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:37,870
potentially to update or maybe we can even improve things a little bit

1549
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:42,900
by by presenting data versus one is it is better to just rewrite the whole

1550
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:45,990
so his his acquittal

1551
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,030
so i thought experiment

1552
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:50,880
if you got terrified of data

1553
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:53,870
and you want to to one percent of the entries

1554
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:58,300
so that is ten megabytes is going to be going to say insert into the

1555
01:43:59,770 --> 01:44:01,940
what's the cost of doing that

1556
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:05,240
and so

1557
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:09,980
just the basic numbers are that you've got if you if you assume that

1558
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:12,940
each entry is a hundred bytes

1559
01:44:12,970 --> 01:44:14,970
and each page

1560
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:17,710
if you're building the tree is ten k

1561
01:44:17,790 --> 01:44:21,220
that gives you ten billion entries

1562
01:44:21,230 --> 01:44:23,170
well in criteria

1563
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:26,160
and you've got one billion pages

1564
01:44:26,190 --> 01:44:29,800
so if you really do is see for every single update

1565
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:33,790
the user adding particular thousand

1566
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:35,340
long time

1567
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:37,320
if you were to

1568
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:40,560
three sort all your update so that you may access each page ones

1569
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:44,760
each tent k block but using the data is fragmented because you have been doing

1570
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:45,700
this for a while

1571
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:47,370
that is going to

1572
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:50,020
one hundred days to do seek to block

1573
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:55,300
that's better you updating ten entries on every page

1574
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:57,710
and only appears once

1575
01:44:57,740 --> 01:45:01,100
but if you just take the whole database if you take the updated data

1576
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:06,030
which is well attended by you sort it and then stream here in parallel

1577
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:07,700
with c and

1578
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:11,960
with the entire terribly database which is already sorted and merge together in a new

1579
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:13,380
version of it

1580
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:14,410
makes sense

1581
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:18,930
it takes twice the amount of space because you've got two copies of you care

1582
01:45:18,930 --> 01:45:20,140
about the data

1583
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:22,730
it only takes today

1584
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:25,730
roughly distributor about data on the drive

1585
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:29,660
given these these constants so it's

1586
01:45:29,660 --> 01:45:30,940
considerably faster

1587
01:45:30,990 --> 01:45:35,010
so time and again you hear people say

1588
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:37,490
they want to do indexing or web crawling

1589
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:42,380
using my SQL or the oracle or something and some SQL database you want to

1590
01:45:42,390 --> 01:45:44,430
do that was wonderful properties

1591
01:45:44,430 --> 01:45:47,460
it and the problem is is is this doesn't scale

1592
01:45:47,470 --> 01:45:50,180
if you want to if you do it scales to a certain point you only

1593
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:53,030
get millions of pages something that but if you're trying to get to very large

1594
01:45:54,030 --> 01:45:58,240
say representing every link because links are the most

1595
01:45:58,990 --> 01:46:03,810
words the most frequent item to deal with links to the next recording pages are

1596
01:46:03,810 --> 01:46:09,330
are after that the pages you might be able to store a relational database

1597
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:13,870
links in words are certainly going to going to kill you actually performance if you

1598
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:16,490
try to do it you're much better off with these these

1599
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:18,300
sort merge space

1600
01:46:18,310 --> 01:46:23,910
strategies that you know people have discovered this again and again and the keep discovery

1601
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:29,210
but just to remind you once more so that aggression

1602
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:30,790
actually see

1603
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:37,710
so the scene was the thing i wrote in my spare time the

1604
01:46:38,290 --> 01:46:43,280
it was a in nineteen seven search engines or not

1605
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:48,160
sure thing that the universe was the

1606
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:49,600
internet stock bubble

1607
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:51,600
was actually

1608
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:54,190
declining many many people but it was over

1609
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,950
and it didn't seem like it was going to

1610
01:46:57,070 --> 01:47:00,050
never get any larger so that well

1611
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:05,910
i had to do something else this i have my my that's sort of and

1612
01:47:06,050 --> 01:47:09,440
i wrote i want to learn job so i wrote search engine on my own

1613
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,580
time time off work and something

1614
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:18,030
and then i even licence it two to one client and then the whole soccer

1615
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:22,250
took off and i got wrapped up the things that excite for another couple years

1616
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:26,290
and then finally came back years later and i don't have to search engine written

1617
01:47:26,290 --> 01:47:27,020
in java

1618
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:32,570
and i didn't know quite what to do with it realized they didn't want

1619
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:36,240
sort of business that was something i was good at are interested in

1620
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:39,670
so i decided put it up on

1621
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:43,350
as an open source project for free

1622
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:44,540
see what happens

1623
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:47,960
i first put it under the GPL

1624
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:50,920
which seems like the standard open source license

1625
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:55,990
and i got lots of people sending email saying we're using GPL i can you

1626
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:57,730
feel software raising trivial

1627
01:47:57,790 --> 01:48:01,940
this was not what i want to i wanted to give something away for free

1628
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:03,620
nine people angry

1629
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:07,680
so i changed lgpl and if you are familiar with licenses i don't know much

1630
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:08,770
about him at the time

1631
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:16,120
we're less angry but were still somewhat frustrated they didn't appreciate that and i a

1632
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:18,160
year later i was invited to

1633
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:23,890
move the project to apache and seem like a reasonable thing to do i

1634
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:26,400
actually i wasn't

1635
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:29,300
that interested in personally but a lot of people that said it was a great

1636
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:31,680
thing to do that like OK let's let's move there

1637
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:36,290
we're starting to build communities i was no longer alone making these decisions

1638
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:41,530
apache licence

1639
01:48:41,550 --> 01:48:45,490
and i've never since then received a complaint about the license

1640
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:47,690
but the and so that's a little

1641
01:48:47,810 --> 01:48:51,100
reference for you depends on what you're interested in getting out of open source

1642
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:54,060
if what you want is

1643
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:59,500
users and little friction licences like apache in the st

1644
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:02,450
in my experience anyway

1645
01:49:02,450 --> 01:49:05,420
get more people using it unless distractions

1646
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:08,320
about the licenses which

1647
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:11,080
i wasn't particularly interested in

1648
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:15,680
in two thousand five losing became a top-level apache project

1649
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:18,140
political technicality

1650
01:49:18,150 --> 01:49:19,330
but the nice

1651
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:24,810
let me talk a little bit about what we've seen is and how it works

1652
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:30,760
it's written in java at the time it was time i started losing their job

1653
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:31,530
was new

1654
01:49:31,660 --> 01:49:37,930
and had there was no search technology for it seems like a good opportunity i

1655
01:49:37,930 --> 01:49:39,150
want to keep the

1656
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,710
the interface very simple

1657
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:44,300
so the people didn't have to some class two

1658
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,950
to use it

1659
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:51,430
with no configuration files that you had the right to start writing code and using

1660
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:54,020
so the things we're dynamically typed

1661
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:58,540
part the first

1662
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:05,720
well anyway the play be here now

1663
01:50:09,290 --> 01:50:11,950
as you see this is this is

1664
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,580
i as the title suggests this is really a set of topics

1665
01:50:16,590 --> 01:50:18,730
rather weakly related

1666
01:50:20,410 --> 01:50:23,890
but do not having a common theme which i hope you discern this

1667
01:50:23,910 --> 01:50:25,460
as time goes on

1668
01:50:25,610 --> 01:50:30,300
so so let me begin by giving the outline of the talk

1669
01:50:32,410 --> 01:50:36,460
i got two microphones and certainly should here

1670
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:42,700
so the first one to talk about classification prediction which provokes here is going to

1671
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:44,310
be pretty old hat

1672
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:48,900
and what i one way i would characterize at least

1673
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,710
goals in statistics and machine learning

1674
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:55,320
which differ somewhat but but but

1675
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:57,520
not not that significantly

1676
01:50:58,010 --> 01:51:02,490
and certainly not in practice and maybe to some extent in theory

1677
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:07,890
and then i'll talk about what i view as an as an apparent puzzle

1678
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:13,250
an apparent disconnect between theory and practice

1679
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:16,200
and there it is in fact that's that's

1680
01:51:16,210 --> 01:51:17,200
part two

1681
01:51:17,220 --> 01:51:19,600
the positive theory somehow tells you

1682
01:51:19,610 --> 01:51:21,330
as i hope this

1683
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:22,650
theory and i know

1684
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:24,970
somehow tells you that really

1685
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:29,440
doing anything in more than five or six dimensions

1686
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:32,240
you should be able to to anything

1687
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:37,270
and yet in practice right i mean people do things in very high dimensions

1688
01:51:38,830 --> 01:51:40,580
one explanation

1689
01:51:41,850 --> 01:51:46,090
obviously partial explanation i think is a theme that

1690
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:48,940
if you've heard about already and i'm sure you'll hear about a lot in this

1691
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:50,770
which is

1692
01:51:50,870 --> 01:51:53,790
dimension that things may not be as

1693
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:56,740
high dimensional if you think are

1694
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,870
so then i talk having

1695
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:01,310
having indicated why that

1696
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:03,910
should be the case that talk a little bit about some theories and they don't

1697
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:05,590
dimension estimation this is

1698
01:52:05,630 --> 01:52:08,090
joint work with please let me know

1699
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:10,400
which basically

1700
01:52:10,470 --> 01:52:13,740
it is to tell you when in fact maybe the dimensions of that you should

1701
01:52:13,740 --> 01:52:15,710
be able to get reasonable results

1702
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:18,150
released this one

1703
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:23,940
then i really rather unrelated line but having

1704
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:27,360
in common the idea that maybe things may not be as bad as you think

1705
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:28,140
they are

1706
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:31,240
is is an improvement by

1707
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:34,520
standardisation which is using ranks

1708
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:38,750
then i may or may not so much about cross validation model selection this is

1709
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:41,400
i think some topic behaviour quite a lot

1710
01:52:41,450 --> 01:52:44,900
and really this is just the justification of why

1711
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:48,970
the fold crossvalidation where v

1712
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,700
grows slowly with the sample size does grow

1713
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:56,870
actually is a good thing

1714
01:52:56,970 --> 01:53:01,000
so in questions results project so so let me begin

1715
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:05,500
the outline if you want o here's

1716
01:53:05,510 --> 01:53:08,780
sort of an indication that there may be this can right

1717
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,390
so here are two books

1718
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:13,410
one which came out in two thousand one and the other one which came out

1719
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:14,760
in two thousand two

1720
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:17,260
in the same series of books

1721
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:22,680
one is i think it's fair to say basically a book about the practice of

1722
01:53:22,730 --> 01:53:26,980
machine learning and statistical learning and classification regression call well

1723
01:53:28,190 --> 01:53:30,810
hasty tibshirani three

1724
01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:32,710
talking about all

1725
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:33,860
there is

1726
01:53:33,870 --> 01:53:37,410
kind of out many many types of algorithms giving some

1727
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:41,530
intuitive judgments occasionally on why they were making statements like you know we have found

1728
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:44,720
that this works in practice

1729
01:53:44,770 --> 01:53:49,060
and then there's the book biography kohler chris i can walk

1730
01:53:49,110 --> 01:53:52,740
which is sort of you want of the tradition of the overall

1731
01:53:55,110 --> 01:54:01,320
much many steven other the people who were here which is a which is results

1732
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:04,310
which is bounds on on on on on

1733
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:05,930
how well you can do

1734
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:09,380
and to indicate that there may be a little bit of a disconnect the later

1735
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:14,380
book admittedly only one year later has exactly one reference and that's one minor algorithm

1736
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:15,570
in the first

1737
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:20,650
right and they're both books which as you can see about six hundred pages each

1738
01:54:20,670 --> 01:54:28,030
so now let me turn to sort of an abstract description the prediction problem of

1739
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:32,480
the prediction problem which again i think will be familiar to most people here

1740
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:36,350
so what we're given in the training sample right

1741
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,760
of high dimensional

1742
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:41,130
in principle covariance x i

1743
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:43,810
and responses y i

1744
01:54:43,860 --> 01:54:47,980
we assume that these are i i d three is sampled from

1745
01:54:48,030 --> 01:54:51,860
a distribution p which belongs to some families repeat

1746
01:54:51,870 --> 01:54:55,180
and x belongs to some space

1747
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:59,230
and why we can think of as being real or let's in the case classification

1748
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,220
just a note to that

1749
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:04,570
but the goal in both cases of course are the first

1750
01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:06,850
in is is of course to predict

1751
01:55:06,890 --> 01:55:11,750
new y given a new x

1752
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:17,970
that's equivalent to the job of constructing a function

1753
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:23,110
which is dependent on the learning sample phi and it's the function from the space

1754
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:29,190
the predictor variables to the real line so that in some sense

1755
01:55:29,230 --> 01:55:31,160
in terms of some loss

1756
01:55:31,210 --> 01:55:33,680
the expected loss

1757
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,290
distance you can think of it between

1758
01:55:36,370 --> 01:55:39,860
the truth and the prediction is small

1759
01:55:39,870 --> 01:55:42,900
and so you basically estimating function of x

1760
01:55:43,010 --> 01:55:47,470
the training sample dependent rules

1761
01:55:48,530 --> 01:55:51,310
again just to make things a little bit more concrete

1762
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:55,470
for the usual when the prediction real number then you

1763
01:55:55,540 --> 01:56:02,290
typical losses are absolute value the alpha usually mean squared error is alpha equals to

1764
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:07,270
classification in the two classes y and d both belong to plus and minus one

1765
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:08,310
for example

1766
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:09,840
if there are only two classes

1767
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:12,360
and the losses of course as usual

1768
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:16,510
zero if your right in one if you're wrong

1769
01:56:17,630 --> 01:56:21,750
as we all know there if in fact
