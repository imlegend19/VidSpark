1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
you can calculate

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,470
the moment of inertia of the sun

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,300
i have used my two face and are squared which is really crude approximations

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,480
because the two fifty m square for solid sphere only holds

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,670
if the mass is uniformly distributed throughout the sphere was the star that's not the

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,100
not with the with the earth either because the density is higher percent

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,210
this sort of gives you crude idea

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,420
so you have that moment of inertia

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,400
which is is

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,000
to calculate with that fifty m more square

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,100
and i did the same for

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,190
this is the radius of the earth

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,240
and you see

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,100
the moment of inertia of the earth

15
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,780
now i want to know how much kinetic energy of rotation these objects have all

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,050
the sun rotates about its axis in twenty six days

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,570
using one day

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,190
and so i finally convert everything to MKS units

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,460
and i find

20
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,820
these numbers for

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,240
rotational kinetic energy

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,470
now look at the number of the sun

23
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,360
one and a half times ten to the thirty six

24
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,510
great-grandfathers must have been puzzled about where

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,340
the solar energy came from

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,930
the light where it came from

27
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,470
conceivably it came from the patient may be

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,860
the sun is spinning down is slowing down and maybe the energy that we get

29
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,770
is nothing but

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,950
rotational kinetic energy

31
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,020
if that were the case however

32
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,680
since the sun

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,640
is four times ten to the twenty six watts

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,320
four times twenty six miles per second it would only last one hundred and twenty

35
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
five years

36
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,930
so you can completely forget the idea

37
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,690
that the energy from the sun

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,510
that we now know of course is nuclear but our great-grandparents did know that

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,160
that the energy would be tapped from kinetic energy of rotation

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,640
let's look at the earth

41
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,140
two and a half times ten to the twenty nine jules

42
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,190
let me try something

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,120
some fantasy on using crazy some ridiculous idea and i'll tell you for that is

44
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,240
remember that the world consumption

45
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,390
six billion people on earth consume about four times ten to the twenty two

46
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,000
every year

47
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,520
so if somehow

48
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,480
i thought if you could tap the rotational energy of the earth by slowing you

49
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,430
maybe we could use it to satisfy the world energy consumption

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,690
i don't know how to do it is of course complete fantasy

51
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,000
you would have to do

52
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,790
it's slow news down

53
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,410
by about

54
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,850
two point four seconds after one year

55
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,960
we slowed down after one year

56
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,960
it would be that they wouldn't last thing and that would last twenty four hours

57
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,750
with only two point four seconds

58
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,020
but of course after a billion years then

59
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,190
you would have consumed of all the rotational kinetic energy and then use would no

60
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,040
longer be rotated it is of course a crazy idea

61
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,940
but sometimes it's cute to speculate about crazy ideas

62
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,700
there is an object

63
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,450
which we call the crab pulsar

64
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,470
it is a neutron star

65
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,310
and it is located in the crab nebula

66
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,660
the crab nebula is the result of the supernova explosion that went off in the

67
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,710
thousand fifty four

68
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,370
and my next lecture i will talk a lot more about that

69
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,270
for now i just want to concentrate

70
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,410
on this neutron star

71
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,760
so here you have the data on the crap also

72
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,760
the mass of the crab pulsar is not too different from that of the sun

73
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,150
is about one and half times more

74
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:40,020
the radius is ridiculously small it's only ten kilometres all that mass is compact in

75
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,760
the ten kilometre radius sphere has rule when the density of ten two to fourteen

76
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,980
grams per cubic centimeter

77
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,500
so of course the moment of inertia is extremely modest compared to the sun

78
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,090
because the radius is so small

79
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,850
and the moment of inertia goes with the radius squared

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,150
if you look at

81
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,580
rotational kinetic energy the situation is very different

82
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,450
because this neutron star rotates

83
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,460
in thirty three minutes seconds about its axis

84
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,040
so it has a phenomenal

85
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,760
angular velocity

86
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,490
so if now you calculate

87
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,610
one have i omega squid

88
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,460
you get

89
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,350
a fantastic amount of rotational

90
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,690
kinetic energy

91
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,490
you get an amount which is

92
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,480
more than a million times more

93
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,020
you have

94
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,870
and this object

95
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,910
also in the crab nebula

96
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,580
is radiating

97
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,000
copious amounts of x-rays

98
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,510
if gamma rays

99
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,290
jets coming out

100
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,010
ionized gas

101
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,450
and we are certainly

102
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,350
that all the energy that this object is is producing

103
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,490
rotational kinetic energy

104
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,050
and i will give you convincing arguments why there's no doubt about

105
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,960
if you take the crab pulsar

106
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,250
and you

107
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,400
calculate how much energy comes out in x-rays and gamma rays and everything you can

108
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,960
observe in astronomy

109
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,470
then you find that it has power roughly

110
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,500
of about six times ten to the

111
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,200
thirty one what

112
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,200
a phenomenal amount if you compare with the sum by the way weighted sum

113
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,710
is only four times twenty twenty six watts

114
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,680
so the crap also alone

115
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,440
generates about two hundred fifty thousand times more power

116
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,750
the sun

117
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,530
we know the period of the pulsar two very high degree of accuracy

118
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,190
period of rotation

119
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,800
of the neutron star

120
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,310
o point o three

121
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,510
zero two

122
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,440
eight three

123
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,640
eight five

124
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,810
a three

125
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,490
the second that's what it is today

126
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,400
i called my radio astronomy friends yesterday

127
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,110
and i asked them what is the rotation period of the neutron star in the

128
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,040
crab nebula and this was the answer tomorrow however

129
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,470
it is longer

130
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,490
by thirty

131
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,260
six point four

132
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,930
nano seconds

133
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,230
so tomorrow

134
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,320
you have to add this

135
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,560
that means it's slowing down

136
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,000
the crab pulsar is slowing down

137
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,980
that means omega is going down that means one half omega square is going down

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,900
and when you do your homework which you should be able to do

139
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,320
to compare

140
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,800
the rotational kinetic energy today with rotational kinetic energy tomorrow

141
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,510
very very toy data mining application i'm doing a linear regression and pretending i don't

142
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,080
know how to do this analytically

143
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,490
so i have a data set and i have

144
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,280
the green line which is

145
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,880
a randomly drawn

146
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,270
the regression line so i'm doing importance sampling and say i'm going to draw a

147
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,780
whole bunch of possible

148
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,880
and then i'm going to from an arbitrary distribution consider sort of all all lines

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,390
and then i'm going to wait them is important something to say which ones actually

150
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,160
fit the data so that i can approximate things under the posterior distribution

151
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,690
most of these lines the rubbish like you know they have nothing to do with

152
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,480
the data and so the importance weight nothing really more like ten minus eight minus

153
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,640
nine ten minus fifty one and only a few of them by chance actually happened

154
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,390
to sort of go through the data and a very small number of them pick

155
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,130
up most importance weight

156
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,360
because this would be much more extreme if you had more than three parameters i

157
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,650
fixed the noise sesame something from two primitives and they what happens i be algorithms

158
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,690
running in this order although you could do this in parallel because there is no

159
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,420
really but you know i feel the sampler the sampler of the sample i finally

160
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,860
get one that's any good

161
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,520
and then i completely ignored that and continued during my time distribution in figure city

162
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,670
one again i get one is OK but then i make it worse again i

163
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,320
make it even worse than ever learn from what i'm doing and

164
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,590
shortly once i sort of got lines in the right ballpark i should be able

165
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,180
to do something with

166
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,960
so as a lot of you already know

167
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,940
the idea of markov chain monte carlo is to come up with algorithms that instead

168
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:31,040
of just randomly during IID proposals from distributions instead of all samples and take small

169
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,550
steps say

170
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,670
here is an algorithm that

171
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,650
i will go into more detail later the

172
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,990
does something different instead of drawing samples independently it proposes small changes to what you

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,830
currently got another is the time ordering developments running along here

174
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,220
so we started off

175
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,800
with this screen aggressive here

176
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,480
and the algorithm does protect that propose different regressor

177
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,320
and is coloured red to say oh that was second project

178
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,500
so it kept the same aggressive it and throw it away and can propose a

179
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,790
different proposed regressor was the last couple

180
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,000
we all want again and then eventually

181
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,790
small perturbation the otherwise traditional good

182
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,560
regression they wanted

183
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,340
in the right ballpark small perturbations tend to be good and so you get a

184
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,550
sequence of reasonable samples

185
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,790
the look as though they might come from the posterior distribution over russian lines that

186
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,140
go through the

187
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,820
so this is a series of pictures in data space and then in terms of

188
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,000
the parameter space of our model

189
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,160
the algorithm looks like this you've got parameters for the person that describe where the

190
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,580
line lies and the algorithm is moving around the space of parameters and the red

191
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,320
line shows that sometimes we propose to point in the parameter space which has low

192
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,990
posterior probability and so you don't go that you use the way you were in

193
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,310
in somewhere else

194
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,410
OK so the question is is the same as

195
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,580
what i literally said

196
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,230
sounds like that because i didn't add any stochastic element to it so i said

197
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,580
you know you could have something better go and if it's works you don't and

198
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:18,240
that would be in error and optimisation method some people call whole climbing this algorithm

199
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,810
if you tweak it

200
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,320
and it's better than definitely go but if you tweak it and it's worse than

201
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,240
sometimes you might go there anyway

202
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,090
and so that stops it from being an optimisation algorithm so we're not going to

203
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,680
be doing maximum likelihood of map nothing to find the best properties we going to

204
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,300
tend to move towards the best practice but also sort of randomly move around a

205
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,120
bit and that's what's going to lead to sample from the posterior distribution the main

206
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,990
this is we do i haven't explained how this works and think this is the

207
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,380
flavor the algorithm we want and then over the next few slides will understand what

208
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,590
actually come from

209
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,570
i have to say

210
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,750
what's the difference between simulated annealing and this algorithm this algorithm predates simulated annealing so

211
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,600
this algorithm was invented in the fifties and the seller must when they're doing developing

212
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,940
nuclear weapons and simulated annealing i think was the eighties

213
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,150
and simulated annealing uses this algorithm in its inner loop but then it does something

214
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,590
else to change the distribution at each iteration so this is a key part of

215
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:26,390
simulated annealing

216
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,660
OK so here is the key idea of markov chain monte carlo we're interested in

217
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,480
some probability distribution and might lie in high dimensional space we can only

218
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,720
evaluate it

219
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
up to you

220
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,020
there a constant but we can evaluate it pointwise up to a constant where we

221
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,980
like and we want to construct

222
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:51,260
some sort of random walk or diffusion process the will explore this distribution

223
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,370
will initialize i walk in some arbitrary way because often these problems that intractable we

224
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:02,160
don't know where places an apprentice start we initialize in some way and then we're

225
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,990
going to

226
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,920
follow a markov chain that is the way that we draw the next step only

227
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,530
depends on the previous step nothing else so we have a probability distribution over where

228
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,480
we can next given where we were before

229
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,670
and using that simple rule we going to want to take steps to wander around

230
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,940
and eventually after some burn in period of sort of finding the distribution will explore

231
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,810
the distribution such that if we looked at where all the

232
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,150
the points awarded to darwin to these blue dots after while i stopped during the

233
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,460
black line

234
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,480
but if you don't wear when those blue dots look as though the sample from

235
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,630
the distribution we're interested in

236
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:42,370
so what we're interested in doing is constructing markov chain finding transition operators all distributions

237
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,000
that if we were to simulate these markov chains have this property

238
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:47,780
and will

239
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,350
to draw samples for

240
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,530
yes there so i more

241
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,920
he what's they question the the samples are correlated and so in some ways not

242
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,750
fair of you know this there maybe not as good in some sense is independently

243
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,120
drawn samples rejection sampling gave us

244
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,840
is information pathways

245
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,470
so in a sense are two things here one is this complex

246
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,100
time shifting of the views you have other people around you know about friday nine

247
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,350
and this person for that person so forth and the other is that these indirect

248
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:33,280
paths can be fast potential conflicts in a sense for arguing is that social networks

249
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,470
affect the bound to what you might call

250
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,710
triangle inequality violations right in which this the quickest path between two people is not

251
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,110
the straight line but some other

252
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,890
round about what you see this is a very very very thing

253
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:51,030
and intuitively progressive rights everything about resemble manager talks each other employees more frequently each

254
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:58,120
is there going into a hundred and or right to adopt children reach up to

255
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,840
each other by talking to parents things like this

256
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,240
there are cases in which there is indirect routes and like actually is

257
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,270
some kind of of strange into a contact between these two microphones being forced to

258
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,660
wear OK so

259
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,670
in fact the social spread information is

260
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,800
and the out of date views people have each other is so pervasive you see

261
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,610
it and all sorts of areas across sciences social sciences humanities right so so so

262
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,490
of a physicist from about this they merely say anything about the light cone

263
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,030
right the light cone is the sort of cone in spacetime meaning away from point

264
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,140
so it's this point that

265
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,480
if two points are k

266
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,170
light years apart then

267
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,790
literally nothing happens within k years ago here can be here

268
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,390
in sociology and we'll talk about it on the talk this very very influential theory

269
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:50,770
called the strength of weak ties that occasional encounters with distant acquaintances can be very

270
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:56,790
very powerful force for conveying information information it's not known within are nearby social circles

271
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,350
and even if you look in

272
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,900
literature other

273
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,400
quite frequently as

274
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,160
literary device this notion of out of date information special time shifting between different parts

275
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,180
of the narrative as for example in this

276
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,580
grim but

277
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,910
now natural passage from the novel

278
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,540
what are the book of

279
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,680
one of the characters dies

280
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,830
finally while

281
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,650
back at home the life went on for a few more hours if nothing happened

282
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,850
the information had reached their home

283
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,560
so life continues the state of suspended animation this notion that information resides in different

284
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,280
places and has hasn't yet percolated to the rest of the world something that really

285
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,160
pervasive and a lot of different settings

286
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,830
i would like to understand

287
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,450
OK so how how we do that we try to take a social network that

288
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,140
which we have lots of people living on a regular basis

289
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,350
we're trying to look at

290
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,220
the views they have each other and these quick information channels through the network

291
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,150
as a formalism we're going to use one of the

292
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,220
one of the famous actually are given

293
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,810
the most worked for thing about information is not in the theory of

294
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,160
this distribu computing the notion of

295
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,540
vector clocks originally introduced by

296
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:17,050
what's really important to formalize one of the network has an out-of-date view another we

297
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,700
this implies that the next few slides really then you find notion of the network

298
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,170
far substructure the network is going to carry

299
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,560
most of

300
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,650
the potential potential for information flow and finally time permitting think about how all this

301
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,550
confusion could potentially be accelerated by local strategies that people use

302
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,060
OK has made this all talk about is going to a complete email history of

303
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,730
a period of two years roughly

304
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,010
eight thousand

305
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:47,650
faculty and staff TRB protocol from naming large university

306
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,430
i was ever actually going to focus on the most active email users in that

307
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,240
sense so

308
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,640
a core set of

309
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,590
over a thousand people who sent and received messages at least once in our continuously

310
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:04,410
for this period of two years OK and how information flow now forces that we

311
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,610
have all phone calls face-to-face communication and so forth and of course it's interesting issue

312
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:14,070
think about how the boundaries which are so as any analysis of things of that's

313
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,160
going to be

314
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,170
it's going to be

315
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,040
a useful list for this purpose we

316
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,540
done someone else's and other kinds of communication is the enron email communication wikipedia admins

317
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,990
and in the absence see similar results

318
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,930
so let's start with vector clarkson we formalise this idea of outdated information

319
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,620
so first in the century defined

320
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,800
we have no overview node you what it means these view of u at time

321
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:47,070
it's the most recent was to provide such information originating intuitive prime could still reach

322
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,280
the by time to

323
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,630
these you have a friday five PM was friday night

324
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,890
the vector clock as

325
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,680
the fundraising by important

326
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,820
refine a lot of work in the can is simply the vector he has to

327
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,340
use all strategies node c down here you can see this

328
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,910
at that time five what is seen no of a and b

329
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,160
well reason view was sometimes three most recently appears from time to and is always

330
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,990
completely up-to-date to

331
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,780
be similar some you

332
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,510
which is never actually

333
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,750
and we the information latency which is simply the difference between

334
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,780
now the current time in and the in the

335
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,060
the this

336
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,440
the set of all the clocks in our case the quadratic size structure everyone interview

337
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,310
everybody else we need to maintain

338
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,910
considered as the

339
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:44,540
ability to read out of this comment and incorporate the ideas into his or her

340
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,780
own books

341
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,960
OK finally the influence of terms

342
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,120
what are termed a appears in

343
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:00,300
link relationship between posting between x and y can be expressed in in formula number

344
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:06,030
and if we denote the influence of terms x as kx

345
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,710
we can calculate the influence of terms like this

346
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,620
for example to a

347
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,460
propagated from posting one to two

348
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,200
from posting two to three

349
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,350
originally anyone from posting one so

350
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,920
influence of terms a k

351
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,790
these three

352
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,510
similarly KB is one in cases one the point i want to emphasise here is

353
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:39,940
that only the propagated terms among link relationships are counted good part of it is

354
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,280
first of all it captures frequent terms

355
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:47,190
seems to have a better chance to be propagated and secondly

356
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:52,190
it picks up infrequent terms that are considered to be valuable by consumers

357
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,660
so there's a qualitative screening by consumer here

358
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,540
using this model we would like to

359
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:08,450
move on to the result of the empirical analysis we applied IDM to blog data

360
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,910
it's collected by both poles

361
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:18,340
from my nifty research institute in japan but this is a blog mining and consulting

362
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:24,150
service to advertisers and it collects over two hundred million blogs approximately ninety percent of

363
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,050
all blogs in japan so it's a pretty big coverage here and topic of the

364
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:34,900
analysis is a new shampoo product launched in march two thousand six it's called tsubaki

365
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:40,950
it means camilleri flower in japanese and the pack it looks like this

366
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,780
the reason we chose this as the topic of the analysis is that first of

367
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:52,260
all it's big news in the sample market in japan it was dominated by unilever

368
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,960
which sells clocks

369
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,610
MP and which spontaneous and college and cal you say though which cells wacky ranked

370
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:06,460
in fourth position however because of the challenge of this project product

371
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:12,070
it became number one selling company of san so there is a major change in

372
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:17,580
sample market and that's why we chose this as the topic of the analysis of

373
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:24,390
social because it features several celebrities in TV commercials it was heavily talked about in

374
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,410
the blogosphere

375
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:32,280
that's another reason we chose this as a topic we collect the data posted between

376
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,620
march which was the launch of the wacky two august two thousand six we screened

377
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,880
blocks containing the term tsubaki and we got a total of ten thousand eight hundred

378
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,920
sixty four postings input

379
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,330
links and trackbacks

380
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:54,070
statistical data is presented over there

381
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,150
we are interested in

382
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:06,460
marketing aspect of the data so what we did was we tagged manually states of

383
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,420
consumer purchase behavior so is

384
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,460
person i can use to research institute opened every twelve days

385
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,860
ten thousand eight hundred sixty three

386
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,410
blog postings and checked whether there is a evidence of purchase on that it like

387
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,160
a weather see

388
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:30,910
use the shampoo see smell that tried purchased bought those kind of wars and if

389
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,430
book talks about smart key some food but has not reached the

390
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,150
state purchase we classified it as a potential customer some of them more

391
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:50,130
unable to classify some of them could not be opened we had three thousand seven

392
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,670
hundred fifty four irrelevant posting irrelevant meaning marketing

393
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,980
twice you event some all these

394
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,330
book postings content awarded about key but they these postings talk about back in different

395
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:11,140
contexts as i mentioned its back is the name of flower so some of them

396
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,290
talked about

397
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,090
it's about key in the context of gardening and some of them of course

398
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,880
i mean many of them last splogs

399
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,880
these are the these are the example marketing armies fought about key she said the

400
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:36,140
company has used forty six million US dollars that's record-breaking advertising expenditure to push this

401
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,510
product they

402
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:45,780
i have hired famous actresses and models in japan attacked i of advertising movies japanese

403
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,400
women beautiful

404
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:55,640
it's called functional forelocks super-rich average which featured hollywood actresses so it's featured

405
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,700
it's meant to

406
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:03,840
give confidence to jeffries wyman the main ingredient or component of the santa camille oil

407
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,740
resulting bouncy hair like that

408
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,700
it also had the lowest level category

409
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:19,890
down there and she said also wanted to push that their corporate brand small light

410
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,230
but it it's a down there and they also wanted

411
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,290
they wanted to court remember

412
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,270
course you might remember the package

413
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,230
there is package and we wanted to know

414
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:40,570
which one of these marketing elements actually reached consumer and spread it in the blogosphere

415
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,870
and this

416
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,420
is the result

417
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,520
this table shows the top influential terms

418
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,900
by term frequency

419
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,370
in the left

420
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,550
and if

421
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,450
it is

422
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,660
they have a good idea

423
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:00,260
and different ranking

424
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,510
so what we can see from here is that ITN picks up frequent terms like

425
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,590
c don't wish the

426
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,890
three current and important terms but also

427
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:16,850
you can be in big trouble

428
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,290
your friends going to blow up

429
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,950
because the ideal gas law

430
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:26,550
works only in very small range of pressures temperatures for gases

431
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,950
we have other

432
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,780
functions equations of state for real gases this is an equation of state for ideal

433
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,180
gases for real gases

434
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,440
there's a whole bunch of equation of state and you can find in textbooks

435
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:44,500
and i'm just going to go through a few of them

436
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:50,180
the first one is uses something called the compressibility factor

437
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,950
compressibility factors instead of writing he a book

438
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,930
is equal to rt

439
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,770
which would be the ideal gas law

440
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,800
we put a five factor in

441
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,520
and the bias factor

442
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,790
it's called the

443
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:12,120
now we can put real incentive ideal for vi

444
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,200
is the compressibility factor

445
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,620
and the

446
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,890
is the ratio of

447
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:22,950
the volume of the real gas divided by what it could be a way for

448
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,240
an ideal gas

449
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:33,850
so have these less than one then the real gas

450
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:37,120
is more compact and then you you

451
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,950
created in one and the real gas

452
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,870
the atoms and molecules in the real graphs are repelling each other

453
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,440
in was behind bigger volume

454
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,730
and you can find this compressibility factors in tables

455
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:58,050
one of the compressibility factors for water for steam pressure and temperature you table and

456
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,490
if find

457
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,680
so that's one

458
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,760
example of

459
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,790
the equation of state

460
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,110
not a very useful one for our purposes in this class is another one is

461
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,480
the variable expect

462
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,070
it's a little bit more useful

463
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,050
what you do is you take that

464
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,290
large factor

465
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,710
and you expanded on taylor series

466
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,720
so we have

467
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,220
the real

468
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:35,850
of party supporters in every since they are right

469
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,740
under most conditions

470
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,300
it's pretty close to one

471
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,120
when is an ideal gas and then we have to

472
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,020
to that

473
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,720
and the correction is going to be more important

474
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,390
so the larger the volume is

475
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,700
whether it's the

476
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:58,700
the limit of p times because to zeros in large body of work large pressure

477
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,720
your the ideal gas rich so let's take

478
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,070
a taylor series in one over the bar

479
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,510
one five

480
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,250
where it's at

481
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,610
and these factors on top

482
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,210
which are going to the temperature

483
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,540
are the virial coefficients

484
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,000
and those depend on the substance

485
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,470
we have this

486
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,810
PDF here

487
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,150
this is called the second virial coefficient

488
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:34,510
and then

489
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,550
so you can get

490
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:43,750
you can actually find the graph of this vfd is something

491
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,090
the function temperature

492
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:52,050
is going to be some temperature would be if t is equal to zero

493
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,890
in that case your gas go look awfully like an ideal gas

494
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,020
something about the temperature is going to be possible

495
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,940
both and temperatures can

496
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,360
generally we ignore

497
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,790
the higher order terms here

498
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,110
so again if you do or

499
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,840
calculation where you're close enough to the ideal gas

500
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,520
and you need to design your

501
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,900
the engineer designing something that's got a bunch of

502
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,570
as is around

503
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:22,090
there right angles to 1 another that we've learned so somehow we have to figure

504
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:29,320
out a way to take orbitals that symmetric and convert them into orbitals that our

505
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,260
symmetric now what does that mean it is symmetric so that means that each bond

506
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,020
has exactly the same energy

507
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:44,120
same behind symmetric bonds means equal equal energy which means equal length if we can

508
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:48,240
do that will end up a symmetric non polar and non-polar molecule

509
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:57,660
this stuff people for a while until another fella came along Linus Pauling

510
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:04,840
the famous for a lot of things 1 of which is 1 of which is

511
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,960
covalent bonding and he said he said well when we take a look at this

512
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,970
1 if I were able to mix

513
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,380
what if I were able to mix the orbital

514
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,180
right what if I were able to mix makes these orbitals

515
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,720
In produced

516
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,180
what he called hybrid

517
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:38,960
but on the a hybrid

518
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,740
In how would you do that well

519
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:47,350
this is worth thinking Cantonese let's just mixed let's just mix the 2 s and

520
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:53,740
2 p orbitals right you to the orbitals and I need I know I need

521
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,060
to come up with with 4

522
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:03,980
symmetric equally bonds and well let's just say strong structure here

523
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,960
and the right mix the 2 s the 2 pieces and I cut in the

524
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,800
buyer my hand rule if I come up with for

525
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:18,910
I've got what I've got I've got 2 states here 3 states here to here

526
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:22,080
and if I came up with the bonds for

527
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,060
by the underlying problem like this and there have

528
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,320
I have I have

529
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,590
of bonds that are of equal of equal energy and he called this s p

530
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:44,910
3 and s p 3 hybrid right and 3 s p 3 hybrid and I

531
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,280
if the drawing justice

532
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:54,500
but let's take a look at how we do this this is the of the

533
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:59,830
group graph left this is the s orbital symmetric these are the p orbitals

534
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:05,890
and these are what these other the probability densities right our friend Escherichia told us

535
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,610
that this is what that if you solve for the wave function this is what

536
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:16,310
the probability densities look like if I now hybridise these if I take these and

537
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:23,280
I make for symmetric just the just the the s p 3 orbitals the hydrogens

538
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,220
non-Aryan notice that this the orbital looks

539
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:33,410
kind of funny Scott big big but a little old and they're sort of back

540
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:38,650
into it so this forms a tetra he'd tetrahedra which forms the SP three hybrid

541
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,650
orbitals now

542
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,260
the hydrogen on the other hand the hydrogen has symmetric s orbitals and now

543
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,920
protagonist is another and just another way to look at what

544
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,820
another way to look at it it takes these S P 3 hybridized orbitals and

545
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,410
you a hydrogen to each 1 and now what you have

546
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:04,870
you have you have a symmetric and

547
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,590
symmetric molecule and would say

548
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:35,260
we have a molecule where we put

549
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,780
but the carbon to carbon in the center and we go up like this like

550
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:47,260
this and not the back and now you have attacked region

551
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,120
with people

552
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:58,850
equal length equal length equal length bonds and

553
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,740
and it's going to be symmetric now would be will be polar and nonpolar getting

554
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:09,800
a little ahead of ourselves what makes something polar versus non polar well

555
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:17,240
if this is if this bond has completely identically equal sharing of electrons then this

556
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,260
bond will be

557
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,280
will be non polar

558
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,020
however were saying that that's not the case for hydrogen and carbon these this bond

559
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,680
will be will be non polar so that means we have 1 2 3 4

560
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,560
non polar bonds

561
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,220
in here and yet the molecule symmetric

562
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,720
and non polar

563
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,190
what's going on well what's going on is the carbon is of the exact center

564
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,570
of the tetrahedra and so

565
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:51,170
the non polar bonds cancel each other out the 2 sources of charge cancel each

566
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:55,540
other out and you get a non polar you get a non polar molecule OK

567
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:03,880
so that's what that's what as appalling but he did a little bit better on

568
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,850
Louis by the way I didn't get a Nobel Prize but pulling did get a

569
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,840
Nobel Prize

570
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,460
so you say to yourself well loses the guy came up with the came up

571
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,150
with the idea why did you get the nobel prize what he came up with

572
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:23,260
the theory but he didn't reduce it reduces to something quantity palling did that

573
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:30,320
so let's go back and take a look at the energetics again let's look at

574
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,370
2nd look at the eugenics now last day of week we talk to look at

575
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:40,480
the energetics of the ionic bond right and we wrote something that looks a lot

576
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:48,650
the energy is equal to minus the Madeleine constant times Avogadro's number

577
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:57,980
if you want to over 4 pi epsilon zero are 0 and we knew that

578
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,830
if we know the crystal structure we can get the maximum constant not a problem

579
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,640
and what we need to do is to get this what we get that well

580
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,700
if we have a

581
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:16,720
if we just take for for example energy all let's try and g magnesium chloride

582
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,070
just as an example we put the magnesium 2 plus here and then we put

583
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,760
the oxygen here

584
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:32,150
to minus and we know that this gives us our are 0

585
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,520
right so we can go and measure that we haven't said much about how to

586
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,150
measure it but you can measure

587
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:43,140
but if we wanted to get the chlorine we could just put the chlorine over

588
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,700
so there is this nice slogan from excess perception

589
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,450
in fact this is the basic difference between images and text

590
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:57,090
image in indexed when you don't have syntactic and semantic analysis words

591
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,050
and birds are very useful

592
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,600
if a a lot

593
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:05,280
it's unfortunately not that useful and isolated peaks do nothing

594
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,920
except which has

595
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,790
o brightness value hundred immediately

596
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,070
there's nothing whatsoever about what's in there

597
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,540
what's in the image so that's the problem we have to move these semantic categories

598
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,840
we have to sort of break up the image into objects labelled them water grass

599
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,680
the labeling could of course be

600
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,420
extended hierarchically

601
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:29,020
so let's give you a little bit about what the problem is

602
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,710
the problem is what we call category recognition

603
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,590
it's not recognizing something exactly the same but something

604
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:37,890
is some

605
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,670
a set of objects which

606
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,390
shared a family resemblance

607
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:48,820
these are all phases of flight these planes and events cellphones but does

608
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,960
we can humans have no problem

609
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:56,110
identifying this is one category even though they are not identical

610
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:01,630
so if you just took the images along with the only differences in those vectors

611
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,070
well those would be quite significant here

612
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,810
but humans have no problem

613
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,480
so so let's go and look at some of the some of the key ideas

614
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:16,810
so there's an idea that goes back actually a hundred years which is due to

615
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,680
someone called d'arcy thompson

616
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:22,080
who was the mathematical biologist nearly hundred years ago

617
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:26,510
and he was studying you know this because for example

618
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,800
and what is common to all these scholars

619
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,730
all these ideas of faces

620
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,220
so here is the basic idea was that

621
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,210
you think of the car

622
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,180
describing shape is hard

623
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:41,050
but describing changes among shapes is not that

624
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:45,420
so the idea is that you have some canonical shape and then you have transformations

625
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,860
of that shape

626
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,400
which take you to these other examples

627
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:55,090
and it's mathematically rather similar to the following idea you have some complex nonlinear thing

628
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:55,810
i mean

629
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,970
you don't know how to deal with it but operating point you can linear is

630
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,780
characterized by

631
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,220
its tangent plane

632
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,880
four years he served in a series expansion that sort of thing

633
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,070
and that's kind of what is going to do

634
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,590
a shape and then we consider deviations from that ship and those deviations are easier

635
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:18,780
to understand than the shape in the abstract

636
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,330
this of course this idea essentially today the topics because more things from one ship

637
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,610
to another but it really going back a hundred years

638
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,110
some of the observations so this is an example of that newscast capital meant to

639
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,000
illustrate the importance of faith

640
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,880
that's why line drawings works

641
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,020
we have taken this image and to place

642
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,810
got the

643
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,300
it in the country and even the one to be replaced by a set of

644
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,920
straight lines

645
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,700
so it's really been boiled down to its fewest bits in some way

646
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,020
we can recognise this and how and if i told you the person did

647
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,380
the yellow and

648
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:02,590
and the pixies in this image according to let you know that it is a

649
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:10,390
so so there's a lot of abstraction and generalisation in the interpretation of an image

650
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:15,110
this is going to be slide but there are hierarchy in this notion of the

651
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,470
notion of categories

652
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:21,810
so for example cats in order find a memory members so is a hierarchy

653
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,510
the which we must be aware of

654
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,700
and recognition can be at these different levels of abstraction that could be something which

655
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,360
i don't recognise what i say

656
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,970
point to fall again

657
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,770
OK that's that's a good enough on civil said of the positive was it it

658
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,700
to be able to say

659
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,810
this is my cat one t

660
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,980
then there is another key which is that object parts they have subparts and so

661
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:51,920
and in fact we can think of this for humans but actually it operates in

662
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:56,470
a high level of objects to objects are part of scenes so right now we

663
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,180
are part of lecture seen

664
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,110
there are people chairs and so on

665
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:05,610
and there are some arrangement which is much more loose spatial arrangement

666
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:11,500
you swiss same immediate partonomy so we have to worry about taxonomies that part of

667
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,200
psychologists have actually given us a sense of

668
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,810
how many categories

669
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:21,550
humans can deal with this estimate of thirty thousand

670
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,480
so when the scalar

671
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:28,270
visual recognition system that's kind of the target to which we have to go to

672
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,080
on the order of thirty thousand visual categories the number of words in english and

673
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,310
obviously more

674
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:39,680
but i mean i would like to create hope charity doesn't necessarily have visual accommodation

675
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,920
in somebody abstract sense

676
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,890
currently we are dealing with more concrete things

677
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,230
so thirty thousand that's what we have to go to

678
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,660
and i'll give you examples which is illustrated that then we have to on the

679
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,540
order of hundred

680
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,960
so we to do the state of computer vision is on the order of hundred

681
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,890
categories and we need to to go up

682
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,900
basically two orders of magnitude from that

683
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,800
and it's not just computing

684
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,500
the axes is being fixed and then you're considering different status

685
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:13,180
you use this station and so this big l stands for like the that's the

686
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,820
likelihood function

687
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,340
o one

688
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:23,940
and something that people sometimes get confused about so this probability can be a probability

689
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,640
mass or can be a probability density

690
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:31,360
if the axes

691
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,520
belong to a discrete space

692
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,840
then they're going to probability masses and if they belong to a continuous space taken

693
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,100
probability densities and he

694
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:47,510
so it we multiplying all these problems together and if their probability masses and we're

695
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:53,680
going to be multiplying numbers together less than one and these probabilities so the the

696
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,050
product probability is going to be a number that is very small much less than

697
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,620
one but still positive

698
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,280
and so actually computationally if you want to implement this

699
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,060
you take the log of the probability of b summing them and then you don't

700
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,980
get numerical underflow but if

701
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:17,470
if the axis belong to a continuous space like euclidean space then the probability densities

702
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,090
can be bigger than one

703
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,270
and so actually the

704
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,230
the likelihood can be bigger than one

705
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,880
so it's not a about your software

706
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,220
if the maximum likelihood is bigger than one

707
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,450
so say had

708
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:43,270
is the argmax

709
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,820
o the stator

710
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,650
the sum from my cause one to

711
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,620
one of the log likelihood

712
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,800
of state

713
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,170
and and

714
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,670
x i

715
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,860
the the logarithm function

716
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,420
and strictly increasing

717
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,530
and so

718
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,650
the product of

719
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:17,900
likelihoods is precisely equivalent to maximizing the sum of them

720
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:23,260
likelihoods so this is called the log likelihood and the principle says that we want

721
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,450
to maximize the sum of money

722
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,100
log likelihoods

723
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:42,350
so if that's clear then i can move on to an example which is going

724
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:44,600
to be more relevant to

725
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,900
logistic regression

726
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:48,860
and this is a very well known example

727
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,530
but it still

728
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,520
worthwhile to

729
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:56,380
work it out

730
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,560
is it

731
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:06,620
for anybody who hasn't seen this derivation before it's got some twists and turns

732
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,870
we're going to work out the maximum likelihood estimate

733
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:17,120
the parameters

734
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:27,400
of the newly distribution

735
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:32,130
what's a bernoulli distribution

736
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:33,550
it's a coin flip

737
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:38,790
and so it really it so it is a special case of a binomial distribution

738
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:43,830
binomial distribution is the distribution of the number of successes if you do n coin

739
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,580
flips and the bernoulli distribution

740
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,400
is the number of successes if you do a single coin flips n equals one

741
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,460
and more

742
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,120
let x

743
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,540
but not

744
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,500
random variable

745
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:14,650
remember the notation capital letters for random variables and then

746
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:19,080
lowercase letters for outcomes of random variables

747
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,250
so the

748
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:27,600
i guess is the conflict of notation before used capital explore the space of all

749
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,730
possible and so here x is the random variable

750
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:34,310
and it's possible outcomes are

751
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,290
zero and one

752
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:41,070
lies close or some new descriptors that we defined by means of background knowledge to

753
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,800
do so by using the descriptors to extracted we can define a new by means

754
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:46,260
of the

755
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:52,930
use new description and discovery can also include background knowledge and they a key

756
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:58,390
so in that case we have by the corresponding going

757
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:05,110
the first step is the task the specification of the

758
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:10,710
a portion of the current testing for the task in december two thousand four the

759
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:17,380
first of all to be in traditional datamining application to because we simply specify the

760
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:23,190
attributes of of the table the testing of water mining but this goal

761
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:30,430
o processor of the notion of the one thousand eight is interesting for all these

762
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:37,610
indicating our specific case firstly we can simply select that of table because in this

763
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:44,480
case we will not consider interaction can be between the different objects in the days

764
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,940
of old

765
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:53,680
because of special that cannot be represented as a single stable of relational databases typically

766
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:02,290
represented by different tables and express the property of objects and the interacting relations among

767
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:08,310
so all we have to specify that belong to different tables and the relationship between

768
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:14,320
these two people the second problem is that classical all the mining one this is

769
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:20,280
to select data typically OK you can use it to combine ss and processing of

770
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:26,110
data about it and we have to select the attributes either directly to the input

771
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:31,040
for the mining could in this case is that the article to will be the

772
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,270
coordinates of the

773
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:39,370
the boundary of only one of the coordinates of the line percent all of the

774
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:45,610
point that represents a special objects and perform mining company called it is not interesting

775
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:51,870
before so it's important to perform a complex transformation inserted data in order to transform

776
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:59,120
these physical information that is the information that we have in the special days in

777
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,750
and your format is a human interpreter so all

778
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:10,640
representing the properties and relations that are interesting before the

779
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:16,210
for specific tasks in this case the first order formulas can be very useful to

780
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:20,020
is the data transformed form

781
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:24,400
so the solution that to we have is that is that is one of key

782
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:31,130
we select exactly the geographical objects testing for answer for example that interact mining geographical

783
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:36,850
object belonging to you draw graffiti or we are interested in OWL

784
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:45,920
o atoms on and specifying the descriptors to wind and to use into in describing

785
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:52,740
these data and and description it is automatically generated by the system is represented in

786
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,750
first order in nature

787
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:02,370
an example for example is the object query where we are selecting all the objects

788
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:08,610
that belong to decide and twenty six of them are dismissed object belong to differently

789
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:15,320
yes and in this case we use all the descriptors of for describing the visitors

790
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:20,450
so we want to it data we take it to the that belong to these

791
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,040
model for example about this trade and

792
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:31,150
compute the properties of the industry to for example the extension property until after the

793
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:32,530
election property and so on

794
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:37,360
and the notion that among these objects for example we have the line to align

795
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:43,690
relations between these objects so these salad that we have a selected from the this

796
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:51,290
is automatically transformed into these the first order representation of all the and if we

797
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:56,400
think to the process to perform when we look at these images except is OK

798
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:02,350
i'm looking at major where you have a blue line that is probably another line

799
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:06,680
that seems to be a street and is line crossing and so on and so

800
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:10,350
when i look at this image i need if be think to the properties really

801
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:15,260
i was it using it to describe them on the

802
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:17,600
the kind of that

803
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,720
that is the same belonging to the idea

804
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:26,490
o percent before the logical opposite by out of this is the list of descriptors

805
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:28,880
that are actually implemented in

806
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:35,070
in terms of the system can be used in the US again query language obviously

807
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:40,170
the list of the script can be extended in a very simple way anyway this

808
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:44,530
is the people that we have decided we do the same colleague of the one

809
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:52,350
is the department that specify what are the properties of the properties relation interesting for

810
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:58,800
them because they have two different approach to measurement of germanic on topological of the

811
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,900
interaction on the program

812
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,830
the reason

813
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:19,720
but particularly in the way of looking at the data organised in there is a

814
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,930
relation that is this one

815
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:27,620
so when i have a very very far see and can make that are altogether

816
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,950
it might be

817
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,520
this also makes sense

818
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,250
you also seem

819
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:40,140
he is

820
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,750
first one

821
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:47,770
even then it can be quite

822
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:52,520
so here is an example of which i took it

823
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,270
the group of christopher myers stanford

824
00:52:56,290 --> 00:53:03,160
there is also mention that it's going to take commission

825
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:06,040
they compare

826
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,040
which is

827
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,660
well actually

828
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:13,040
critical edition

829
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,100
he was

830
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:20,120
two and named entities to

831
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,330
for instance was signed

832
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:23,790
first look

833
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,250
but if you classify in text

834
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,180
this leaves

835
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:38,750
for instance in new york location

836
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:40,720
maybe not

837
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,410
because the

838
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,310
in this form

839
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,830
or any

840
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,060
and both mention

841
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,680
but usually use

842
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:55,660
so that that's what we

843
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,620
in this course

844
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,140
so we have

845
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,970
it certainly is

846
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,290
you could use this information

847
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:09,290
the second time see

848
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:10,700
so you use

849
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:15,850
like a lot information for this cause

850
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:20,970
certainly get see this with the

851
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:24,040
otherwise just look at it

852
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,160
census classes

853
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,950
in terms of some

854
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,520
so in text

855
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:35,810
that is the

856
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:38,160
so you can exploit

857
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:42,720
so this is this is also what has been

858
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:47,600
the two the two stage approach

859
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,930
and it's quite successful

860
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:53,290
so this not

861
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,410
they tested data

862
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,310
in natural language

863
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:08,390
and they have

864
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:10,990
why would they not

865
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,370
so i'm going to be

866
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,000
for each

867
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,470
but some of them

868
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:19,310
it's limited

869
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:21,160
that is the case

870
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,680
he also semantic

871
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,950
which is the

872
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,950
a little bit more

873
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,200
so the first thing to say

874
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,620
and you see that

875
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,270
here we have people from

876
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:41,120
when one

877
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:46,580
they also features from the complete this course and from local windows

878
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,500
for me

879
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,160
and they are the team

880
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:56,060
for all these classes conversation decision to use

881
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:02,290
the sum is over eighty percent

882
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:03,700
thank you

883
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,750
f one score

884
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:12,310
this is all about the same room actually

885
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:17,870
they have also

886
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:22,890
we have this gives

887
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:30,700
this good for approximate in humans we have quite good examples

888
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,930
in this case

889
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:41,370
are the argument that we to station because even better results

890
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:46,750
one hundred percent for this named entity recognition task

891
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:48,000
which was to be

892
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,040
in addition his local features

893
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,640
you're trying to get

894
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,720
which you look for information

895
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:59,310
just not so that

896
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:01,270
after the first step for

897
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,660
incorporated as feature

898
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:14,410
in your next classification

899
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,330
somehow could come

900
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,850
chapter section of unsupervised learning methods

901
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:36,930
the reason i actually made some results because not all cells

902
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:43,490
the results of hand crafted signed according to the flight because

903
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:47,370
it's not all the human performance in some

904
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:49,930
in the nineteen percent so users

905
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,390
it consists

906
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:53,970
you team

907
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,160
so they make this this has been shown

908
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,390
well there is a lot of i notation

909
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,890
for instance before by

910
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,720
like people

911
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:15,580
people were satisfied by their life science and it is shown that

912
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:23,540
even well actually people like these these persons they make sense they are not consistent

913
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,990
in semantic except for creation

914
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:34,950
this tractor tyre so we need to do it so there is this great

915
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,870
so usually human labeling well i

916
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:42,560
the show that it was the and it was

917
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,540
nine ninety five six percent

918
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,430
he is

919
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:49,560
way that's interesting but a part of the rotation

920
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:53,310
this slide also has a sort of the point which is the center say that

921
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:58,040
the data of interesting data we also get multiple prototypes may not be just one

922
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:04,250
six with rotating maybe another six nine in this case is one six nines so

923
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:08,510
we have one six to rotating and another nine in another portion of space this

924
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:12,220
a little bit of of manifold living in this high dimensional space is what the

925
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,540
actually lives on

926
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:16,150
now in practice

927
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:19,020
this is a city model right because of course

928
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:23,300
the data may undergo several distortions far more than we've shown here

929
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,100
for example digits as well as undergoing rotational

930
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,340
they undergo a process known as stating where the stroke the digital becomes fast friends

931
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:36,990
in translation as well so they move around in that box that's possible too

932
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:43,160
the point is the data structure

933
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:47,640
and this is almost how i think of data structure how i define data structure

934
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,490
there's me and so skipping one aspect here

935
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:54,910
which is to do with conditional independence is another way of dealing with high dimensional

936
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:59,400
data is to specify conditional independencies and this isn't that the the way i tend

937
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,650
to think of data with structure is that we expect fewer of these types of

938
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,160
and there are dimensions in the original dataset

939
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:10,220
and and that's the real world

940
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:12,600
inherent dimensionality by data

941
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:15,200
not the three thousand six hundred forty eight

942
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:19,600
pixel space is the number of sort distortions it's going

943
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:24,480
that still leaves is a difficult question because it may be for example

944
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:29,680
consider seven zip and modeling all sevens we'd have to have prototype sevens which have

945
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:34,810
slice across drawn we're slice across the

946
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:38,350
the upper right portion of the city and that's going to be a slightly different

947
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:43,350
prototype and that type seven may undergo a slightly different set distortions than the other

948
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:44,740
types of sevens

949
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:50,060
so in this high dimensional space where we've got these multiple distortion is going on

950
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,030
in may not be that it's got an explicit dimension even it may be the

951
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:57,610
different parts of the space have different slightly different dimensionality but

952
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:00,420
the general conclusion is that we should look

953
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:06,000
to deal with high dimensional data by looking for lower dimensional non linear embedding

954
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:08,560
so that's the basic sort of motivation

955
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,830
why you're interested in doing

956
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:14,460
dimensionality reduction

957
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,880
so just before we go on i want to do a little bit of notation

958
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,200
i'm going to be working with

959
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,470
data space

960
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,720
well my data matrix is why

961
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:33,490
so this is the observed data the six that we've seen the rotated eight seven

962
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:39,630
now i'm going to be looking at low dimensional latent or embedded spaces

963
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:44,600
now attend school in latent space is as artifact of probabilistic sort of language

964
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:48,690
for a lot of dimensionality my latent space is going to be denoted q

965
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:54,210
the originality of the data space is going to be demented noted big

966
01:01:54,950 --> 01:02:00,230
big d in six case was three thousand six hundred forty eight

967
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:04,430
and then i'm going to be dealing with an data points where

968
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,420
and in the six case was three hundred sixty for each degree rotation

969
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,070
now i'm going to draw my data in terms of the data matrix which is

970
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,350
called the design matrix so why

971
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:17,870
has n rows and the columns

972
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:23,350
and it's made up of each data point is a vector y

973
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,020
from the first row out to the enthroned this column notation indicates the vector these

974
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:31,930
should always be filled in this column vectors but not the transpose here so this

975
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:35,310
matrix here has and the rows and the columns

976
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:39,220
that's important this is the other way of writing it when it is each feature

977
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:40,130
of the data

978
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,700
the first feature after the the feature

979
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:45,780
and the same with the latent variables now this this way of writing the matrix

980
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:50,650
is important because when we come to write and covariance matrices in matrix notation it's

981
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:54,090
sort important that's the way around we're using

982
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,810
i'm actually not going really make use of that mapping matrix or the entry matrix

983
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:01,240
although i thought i might when i was writing this like

984
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,300
OK so these are the main sort of important things the latent variables is going

985
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,830
to be my representation

986
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:10,860
all the that data in the reduced dimensional space so within

987
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:16,760
this examples these are my latent variables x one x two

988
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:26,480
OK so just to sort of recovery capitulate a is vector from the ith row

989
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,300
comma code that sort of matlab notation

990
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:34,890
and a coal college a is a vector from the jth i column should say

991
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:38,980
and x and y are design makes now

992
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:43,770
and all the centring there but the sample covariance this it's important the sample covariance

993
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:49,100
s is given by one of the number of datapoints times y transpose why OK

994
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:49,490
so why

995
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,210
that is the center version of data

996
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,480
so the centering matrix takes y

997
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:00,850
and roses mean that's basically it's effect so why is what will typically be working

998
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:04,770
with which is a censored version of our data if y had dissented i don't

999
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:07,960
know how used to this notation you what you can write down the covariance as

1000
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:11,830
one of and y had transpose what happened

1001
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:15,980
the centred inner product matrix and it is important to you already and think it's

1002
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,080
been seeing some kernel stuff

1003
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:22,380
is the kernel matrix why hats while transpose so

1004
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,900
well there is an inner product t appears on the outside which can slightly confused

1005
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:30,900
people but this is the standard statistics notation for the inner product matrix and the

1006
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:36,240
covariance matrix so that's sort of important message from the notation

1007
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,270
OK so

1008
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,880
how we get into

1009
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:41,190
dimensionality reduction

1010
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:47,220
the way we get used to do it is by distance matching

1011
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:50,650
so kinds of classical statistical approach

1012
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:54,650
so we represent our data via sort of proximity how near they are to each

1013
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:57,860
different types of proximity data

1014
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:03,510
one type of similarities and the other is dissimilarity one example of the dissimilarity matrix

1015
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,580
is a distance matrix

1016
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:08,550
so we're just be using mostly

1017
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,340
the euclidean distance

1018
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:14,980
so that's the l two norm of the difference between two vectors so it's simply

1019
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:18,500
this my notation for the l two norm two data points

1020
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:21,820
this is the distance between them is denoted d i and d j

1021
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:22,990
college a

1022
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:24,670
and this is just the

1023
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,530
matrix way of expressing which is the square root of this vector inner product with

1024
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:32,140
the vector skin from the distance between the

1025
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:35,190
this attraction between two vectors

1026
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:39,890
now for any given data set can display that distance matrix

1027
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,890
well i display in the distance matrix

1028
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:45,220
the sixs states rotated sixes

1029
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:49,070
this is what it looks like

1030
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,260
so what we see is

1031
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:53,820
this is zero down here is dark blue

1032
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:57,930
the red dog right here is about

1033
01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:01,360
and a half thousand but the scale is really that important here because we can

1034
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,210
always use rescale things

1035
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:07,180
you'll notice immediately is about eight hundred eighty

1036
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:11,150
degrees rotation so these are the data point labels remember each one is the degree

1037
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:16,790
so my collaborators MIT in total collapse group use support vector machine to distinguish two

1038
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:18,130
types of leukemia

1039
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:23,750
OK lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia OK the the sometimes mixed together

1040
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:27,770
now when actually ran the support vector machine they find one patient with a very

1041
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,420
large alpha value

1042
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:32,940
and as i said could be an outlier of could be just correct but unusual

1043
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:37,090
point they went back to the medics and query this particular sample and it being

1044
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:40,240
a patient who have been wrongly classified in terms of the senior

1045
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,230
OK so you can spot

1046
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:45,510
what's going on from alpha this harks back to a common to made at the

1047
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:49,860
that we have much greater interpretability as this model

1048
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,630
then something new network

1049
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:59,780
OK so of course i think to try and get the ends of the support

1050
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,650
soft margins and might break

1051
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:06,670
right so my story so far has been nice simple story of data which is

1052
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:12,130
very separable OK somebody else new audience what happens when my data is not separable

1053
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:16,760
they also problem is to exploit the second point in that band which i mentioned

1054
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:22,970
i said that the jury theoretical generalisation bound does not depend on the dimensionality of

1055
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:23,960
the space

1056
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:29,190
and in fact therefore

1057
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:30,400
this means

1058
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,730
i can make

1059
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:32,920
my data

1060
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,090
from input space into a high dimensional space

1061
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:39,490
and the reason why i want to do that the many reasons why my wife

1062
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:44,050
do it one of them is by mapping from a low dimensional space to high

1063
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:49,050
dimensional space if my data is horribly into mashed in a low dimensional space

1064
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:52,710
in in high dimensional space it will be separable

1065
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:58,190
indeed that's indeed will be doing now

1066
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,650
is always the case if i'm at from

1067
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:03,650
not separated data

1068
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:08,320
into high dimensional space it will separate what was found is and always the case

1069
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:11,170
indeed i think it's actually cleared would be

1070
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:15,360
some of you may know the xall

1071
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:17,190
four and parity problem

1072
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,240
don't have hands can't quite sketch on the ball but

1073
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:24,900
if i consider q in which i moved plus

1074
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:27,690
minus plus minus on all the edges OK

1075
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:31,300
that date is maximally international OK

1076
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,490
now the simplest one is actually the xall

1077
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,990
problem whatever

1078
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:42,690
and here just mentioned plus minus minus plus OK

1079
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:47,340
now i can draw line which separates the pluses and minuses OK

1080
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:51,210
however if i go from that two-dimensional space to three dimensional space

1081
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:55,260
i move the pluses in the board the two months is out

1082
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:58,340
i can easy draw a hyperplane that separates the two

1083
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,070
OK this three-dimensional i can do is in three

1084
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:05,990
but i can't do plus minus minus plus can't separate the line into

1085
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:09,880
OK so nd if i go to this high dimensional space i can separate the

1086
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:12,030
and that's my trick

1087
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:13,630
to handle

1088
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:16,920
into mesh data indeed i've never found problem

1089
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:18,570
i can't handle

1090
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:21,920
using a support vector machine and the right kind

1091
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:30,240
yes the question

1092
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:43,400
if i typically use come under the gauss income which about to use

1093
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:47,840
again i think i strictly an infinite dimensional space so i've never

1094
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,030
i've done in parity two spirals problem

1095
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:53,530
on many different horrible problems with it

1096
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:57,280
guess can never found an instance where the sum sort the problem

1097
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:03,690
non-zero training error

1098
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:06,300
it may be the case yes

1099
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:09,800
for any parity x would be the case yes

1100
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:13,490
some problems where everything is the support vector

1101
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:20,020
typical real life datasets can be down to a of the data support vectors just

1102
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:22,340
depends data OK now

1103
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,820
OK probably when she was a good idea to map the high dimensional space

1104
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,820
now one point of course is high dimensional space

1105
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,740
is going to have to be an inner product space OK now

1106
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:38,300
let's just go back to the object i had

1107
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:40,840
we notice

1108
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,420
but my data was here

1109
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,550
as i remarked in particular

1110
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:49,360
i could redefine the exit collect xbx prime

1111
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:51,110
and ex-prime y

1112
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,360
x OK

1113
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,990
so if you like really

1114
01:10:53,990 --> 01:11:00,150
all my data is in the four former over dot product x dot x OK

1115
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:03,190
so that's where my data appears

1116
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:05,490
and hence the end of the day

1117
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:09,050
if i'm at a high dimensional space i must match

1118
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:14,400
the inner product x star that's goes to phi x dot phi x

1119
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:15,260
and five

1120
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:16,940
will be my mapping function

1121
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:21,530
four input space to this high dimensional space which we call feature space

1122
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:25,320
why aren't things

1123
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:27,840
about kernel methods

1124
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:31,550
is that i do not need to know what the mapping function is

1125
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:33,380
by choosing kernel

1126
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,760
which are due shortly

1127
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,350
at thirty frames per second

1128
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:39,520
and idea the freedom domain

1129
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:46,040
it turns out the translation case we can obviously look at cross cross correlation

1130
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:49,170
and in the frequency domain i can do this

1131
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:54,920
order in log whereas in the spatial domain is order in square so i actually

1132
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:56,670
but i still something here

1133
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:00,470
things and so i can i can speed things up to a reasonable man but

1134
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:03,230
that if i actually

1135
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:05,120
every pixel

1136
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:06,050
with in

1137
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:08,250
within the template needs to be looked at

1138
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:13,270
if i need to look at every pixel in the template then this if taken

1139
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:18,890
but bombing what if i can start getting cleverer than sampling to say like i

1140
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:20,740
think about only need to have

1141
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:25,200
in pixels or in different representations of the pixel rather than looking at all the

1142
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:29,690
different representations i can speed things up a lot more but so people use FFT

1143
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:31,500
is also not just for

1144
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:39,070
learning discriminative classifiers but also just even if i did generates empirically noisy examples showing

1145
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:41,960
misaligned examples i could still take that linear

1146
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:44,670
classifier the spatial classifier and

1147
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:47,790
value added very quickly in the fourier domain and this is kind of something that

1148
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:54,590
you signal processing things about the benefit fifty by doing something in regular correlation

1149
01:12:56,430 --> 01:13:00,820
have some problems elegant but negative images

1150
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:05,690
so the negative images just circular shifts so sometimes it make sense of the thousand

1151
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:09,940
things objects in natural images very always and scale

1152
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:15,190
then just translation so you only have negative examples in terms of translation what happens

1153
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:20,920
if i wanted invariance scale rotation other types of things the kind of limited there

1154
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:25,430
and it does not it doesn't give you add noise regularized but a lot time

1155
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,280
it doesn't give nice graceful degradation if

1156
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:32,090
the object isn't precisely aligned that's another problem

1157
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:36,730
so i think you were left with the problem of synthetically obtaining positive and negative

1158
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:38,810
examples of sort of back to that again

1159
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:46,080
so those two problems with that collecting positive and negative training samples and learning computationally

1160
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,280
feasible model with large dimensionality so

1161
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:53,280
in large and a lot of the so what i mean by that is that

1162
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:54,990
if i think of my imply

1163
01:13:55,030 --> 01:14:00,740
now general with ten quite generically as you can think of it as an image

1164
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:07,200
but move on to essentially this a parametric representation of my classifier all the time

1165
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:10,630
i'm not going to be able to visualize my template but in vision i'm just

1166
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:13,290
going to keep on talking about as my template

1167
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:17,670
and the thing going have to do is that so i need to have a

1168
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:23,120
way of learning something that even though might imply for the classifier that i'm going

1169
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:27,290
to deal with has a very large feature spaces say like seven twenty one twenty

1170
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:31,950
minutes at the very small four hundred four hundred three parameters and a lot of

1171
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:36,880
examples of hundreds of millions of images you have learn from that and obviously there's

1172
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,990
a lot of machine learning stuff out there to do that

1173
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:48,950
generally for objects now this coming through again kind of face because that's where a

1174
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:54,570
images on that this recurring true for a lot of other objects like motorcycles cars

1175
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:58,740
street signs things like that the general problem is if you want to come to

1176
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:04,620
get an approximate what kind of box area of an object like i should discourse

1177
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,440
always the scale orientation translation what i mean is that here for instance the eyes

1178
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:14,500
nose and mouth there are exactly aligned its is basically you want to be within

1179
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:19,440
a reasonable reasonable proximity and the reason that you want that's not just because you

1180
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:24,610
lazy you want that noise you're essentially building into this this idea of the graceful

1181
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:27,980
degradation you bucolic giving it a bit to give it doesn't have to be precisely

1182
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:32,280
on ice this happens precisely when i was because i can sample at all always

1183
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:35,540
point i want to give it some people so

1184
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:39,640
and we do that across i mean a lot of space that's out there but

1185
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,580
we do that cross arm

1186
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:43,740
a lot of that

1187
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:48,120
one day ones what they actually troll the web interface images and they actually they

1188
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,350
keep on showing up in the millions of faces

1189
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:57,030
another object and then generating negative examples is actually pretty cheap

1190
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,770
i think it's basically come to get if you've got an image

1191
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:04,220
and you know the sort of place and the i can just essentially randomly sampled

1192
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:10,880
from the threat the negative image in this great databases to do that capture forever

1193
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:15,190
in caltech he's got his caltech one one object database and i think the only

1194
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:16,070
one that too

1195
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:20,150
there's a couple of and they using the generic object recognition but it's actually a

1196
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:24,470
great resource for getting negative images because they got one hundred one different classes of

1197
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:26,710
objects and you basically go through so well

1198
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:31,300
i know that i'm not looking for these and then use basically sample pose free

1199
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:35,340
negative images and since it's actually pretty cheap with the world wide web metal lot

1200
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:37,450
easier to get good images and so

1201
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,520
you can kind of do that on and on and on

1202
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:42,780
as the commission

1203
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:48,340
and so it so the brain in sort of positive and negative examples now it

1204
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:52,860
will only classifier to discriminate between large training sets of positive and negative samples we

1205
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:58,190
need an that list sequentially because essentially with one day computers

1206
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:01,670
if we're dealing with thousands if not millions of images we cuts rule that memory

1207
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:06,860
even all the time with the memory hierarchy and computers to we might not want

1208
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:11,930
to because it might really slow down learning things that we want something that can

1209
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:16,100
can learn sequentially or you break down the problem to make it a lot easier

1210
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:21,990
so so cannot obviously boosting boosting something that obviously comes to mind because you might

1211
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:25,700
be able to speak can learn single features going to keep going back iteratively and

1212
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:31,580
reinforcing and other things like if you think but obviously like with within SVM this

1213
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:35,890
so what is the BCI part and that we would like to predict on which

1214
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,330
side and when

1215
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:39,560
the thing attempting will happen

1216
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:42,600
before it actually happened

1217
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:46,020
OK so that's the first BCI type thing

1218
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:49,580
the second is that we imagine some movement

1219
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,060
and we use it for sake because the control of playing brain pong as you

1220
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:55,310
have seen in the early video

1221
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:56,660
this lecture

1222
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:58,660
i will first

1223
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:02,160
talk about this the real movement

1224
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:04,310
and for this

1225
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:06,830
some of the underlying physiology

1226
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:12,450
imagine if you move your right hand

1227
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:15,020
at t equals zero

1228
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:18,220
this is over

1229
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:21,910
c three this is an electrode on the list left hemisphere

1230
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,080
so if i

1231
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:31,520
to a lot of these experiments on average all the signals in c three

1232
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,910
then i might get to curve like this

1233
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:37,250
in fact they do it and

1234
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:38,700
the interesting thing

1235
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,470
that you that you see here

1236
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:46,080
and do you actually see anything is enough contrast or should

1237
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:49,520
so you see that

1238
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:51,580
about point six

1239
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,330
seconds before

1240
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:55,750
the actual typing

1241
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:58,140
there's an activity building up

1242
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:02,660
this is the so-called but i just potential preparatory potential

1243
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,310
so with this

1244
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:06,790
your brain has to move

1245
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:09,620
o thing

1246
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,270
so this

1247
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:18,160
another thing which is the point two five seconds you actually

1248
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:20,640
your brain

1249
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:23,430
prepares movement

1250
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:31,640
if you react who saw him OK so that would be a reaction thing OK

1251
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,740
sorry for that

1252
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:37,080
so it's much faster much steeper

1253
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:43,390
but the integral is about the same

1254
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:53,250
so interestingly somewhere around point three seconds we become aware of all upcoming decision

1255
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:54,520
and there's some

1256
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,080
o thing

1257
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,160
somewhere here

1258
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:02,890
it's called the point of no return so so until then we can veto the

1259
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:06,980
decision so we can decide not to do it

1260
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:12,930
after we've past this point we have you know issued a command and it's being

1261
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:18,330
executed so it you you smash the the door of your car car the keys

1262
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:23,540
inside you know the situation and that's where you have passed on from return although

1263
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:29,480
while you smash you already know that you know you shouldn't be doing that

1264
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,100
OK so

1265
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:36,020
the idea now is to to be predicting you know whether left or right away

1266
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:40,250
that all the movement will take place way before

1267
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:44,680
this time equals zero

1268
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:48,810
OK let me

1269
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:56,000
talk a little bit about this maybe you just look at the lower

1270
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:58,200
set of graphs

1271
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:01,160
and i just play around with it a little bit

1272
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:02,160
so this is

1273
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:05,310
left trying to left and right hemisphere

1274
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:07,640
right and left hemisphere

1275
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:13,140
just explain this a little bit more detail the system knows this is a picture

1276
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,290
from above

1277
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:19,430
and this shows so to say that the distribution of the measurements that you too

1278
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:21,930
can get on on average

1279
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:23,830
in the repeated here

1280
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:30,820
the stopping criterion is satisfied we stop adding conditions here

1281
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:32,690
when the we stop

1282
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:37,610
i don't know negative example is covered by this rule

1283
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:42,060
so when we have produced such a clean rule which covers only the positive examples

1284
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,600
or some other performance measure are

1285
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:49,830
ten is satisfied like the quality of the rule is

1286
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:55,830
let's say the classification error of the rule is below a certain classification error which

1287
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:57,240
has been a lot

1288
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,770
we then had this rule to the set of rules to delete all the positive

1289
01:22:00,770 --> 01:22:01,970
examples from

1290
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:07,040
covered by the rule from the set of examples and we repeat

1291
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:10,070
building the set of rules until now

1292
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:13,170
when we stop building the set of rules

1293
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:17,320
until stopping criterion is satisfied like

1294
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,570
if we have exhausted the set of all positive examples

1295
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:23,640
or alternatively we could have a certain

1296
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:27,940
performance heuristic measure over the set of rules being

1297
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,510
under certain

1298
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,620
user defined

1299
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:38,860
OK so this is just a slightly more complicated version of what we had before

1300
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:43,390
where we have replaced the simple stopping criterion

1301
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:49,570
used individual road construction by a slightly more complicated one

1302
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,940
and here

1303
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:57,080
having replaced the simple stopping criterion for rule set construction which is initially when all

1304
01:22:57,090 --> 01:23:04,530
the positive examples have been covered by some other potentially slightly more complicated heuristic criterion

1305
01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:11,110
for stopping the construction of a set of rules

1306
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:13,960
now how do we learn one rule

1307
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:17,690
in the approach which we have

1308
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:19,460
just outside

1309
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,420
we said well we say class

1310
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,110
c class one

1311
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:28,830
we see i reaches the selected class

1312
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:33,670
let's say one attribute

1313
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:35,770
let it i equals

1314
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:45,150
let's suppose we have a number of conditions

1315
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:48,930
now the question is when we learn such a rule

1316
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,650
how do we

1317
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:51,790
decide which

1318
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,860
that's the value to add

1319
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:56,920
to the body or to the condition part of the rules

1320
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,880
again that would be some heuristic evaluation measures telling us which attribute value is the

1321
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:07,670
similar as in decision tree learning when we had to decide which attribute is the

1322
01:24:07,670 --> 01:24:12,000
best to be put in the mold of the decision tree now we're asking ourselves

1323
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,560
the question which actually the value is the best

1324
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:21,090
for describing the particular class

1325
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:25,150
of obviously we have

1326
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:27,900
for all attributes

1327
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:30,630
we have all the possible

1328
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:47,670
so we are searching

1329
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:50,590
through the space of all possible values

1330
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:53,420
now again this is the search problem like

1331
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:58,360
everything we are doing in artificial intelligence it's the search problem looking through the space

1332
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:03,940
of all possible sets of of all the possible rules which could be constructed from

1333
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:08,590
the attribute values which are used to describe our data

1334
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:13,670
so which of these attribute values is the best to be put as the

1335
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:16,090
as the first condition

1336
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:17,560
in the rule

1337
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:22,040
that would be some heuristic which will tell us which of them is the best

1338
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,920
and in greedy search

1339
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:28,560
the algorithm decides one

1340
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:32,060
attribute value like this one suppose this one

1341
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,610
put there

1342
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,020
and decide then

1343
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:40,170
once it has sixty set to value which is the next best attribute values to

1344
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:42,540
be put in the condition

1345
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:46,570
that has to do with greedy search once you fix one then you can fix

1346
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:47,610
the one

1347
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:50,690
and so on and so on attentively

1348
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:51,590
that is

1349
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:53,670
beam search approach

1350
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:55,650
used in heuristic search

1351
01:25:55,650 --> 01:26:00,900
in beamsearch at each point used for instance a if the being

1352
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:05,420
size is five to say well this is one of the best this is one

1353
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:08,110
of the best this one is one of the best this one is one of

1354
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:10,020
the best and that's one

1355
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:12,540
and this is the

1356
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:17,630
first second third fourth fifth best

1357
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:19,440
we have been size of five

1358
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:21,310
now for all of them

1359
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:22,590
we say well

1360
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:27,310
what is the next best attribute value if we added to the condition of the

1361
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:29,670
and again

1362
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:31,590
for each of these

1363
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:35,040
we have five

1364
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:38,670
and from all these possibilities we against select five

1365
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:41,400
so that would be being search

1366
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:44,210
so obviously greedy search

1367
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:45,900
is more efficient

1368
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,730
but through greedy search you can also lose

1369
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:53,520
some better option which you would have gotten if you had

1370
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:56,130
the longer look at

1371
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:58,670
so there is a trade-off between efficiency

1372
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:03,440
and the possibility that you will is me some better option by not doing beam

1373
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:09,730
and of course the most time consuming would be exhaustive search just looking at all

1374
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:20,110
the possibilities but usually you don't have time the for doing that

1375
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:21,170
OK so

1376
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:25,290
suppose we fix the head of the rule

1377
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:28,750
the conclusion part of the rule to a certain class

1378
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:30,540
like contact lenses heart

1379
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:33,860
and now we are building one particular group

1380
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:37,590
namely the conjunction of attribute values

1381
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:44,190
we're asking ourselves what is the first attribute value which is the best

1382
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:47,110
to be added in the condition part of the world

1383
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:52,610
we have a large number of possibilities

1384
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:56,230
content fences hard if i think is in the snow

1385
01:27:56,290 --> 01:28:01,770
or if astigmatism is yes or if the production is normal or if the production

1386
01:28:01,770 --> 01:28:06,330
is reduced and so on and so on so these are all the possible

1387
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:09,610
if then rules with a single conjunction

1388
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:11,840
in the condition part of the world

1389
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:13,650
so which of them is the best

1390
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:16,000
so let's look at the distributions

1391
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:20,590
well here we have zero zero twelve very good

1392
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:22,310
it's a clean room

1393
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,500
what about this one

1394
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:28,310
five four three if look in terms of entropy

1395
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:30,150
we would obviously

1396
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:34,460
be very happy with this rule because it has the lowest entropy

1397
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:39,060
it is also very good because it has a high coverage

1398
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:41,830
namely this rule covers twelve examples

1399
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:42,900
out of

1400
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:47,940
the set of twenty four examples i believe which we have in the training set

1401
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:50,190
so this would be a very good candidate

1402
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:52,790
what about these

1403
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:56,210
some of these may be good candidates

1404
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:59,860
if we add some other condition to the body of the rule

1405
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,730
as such they are not very good rules

1406
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:04,340
OK so

1407
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:05,360
shall we

1408
01:29:09,730 --> 01:29:12,190
another condition to the

1409
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:14,750
so this rule well it doesn't make sense

1410
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:20,650
adding another attribute value is the conjunctive description here because this is already

1411
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:26,000
nice clean rule covering twenty twelve instances of a class not

1412
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:30,770
so we would no longer add conditions to the body of this rule

1413
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:36,200
a really simple dumb way of doing dimensionality reduction is called feature selection

1414
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:40,880
well this extract dimensions from original data y

1415
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,440
and we'll make up

1416
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:46,460
x by extracting columns y just putting them into works

1417
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,410
so that's just

1418
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:51,810
representing data by a subset of the features in the original data it's a common

1419
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:56,840
problem in itself but it is a specific example of dimensionality reduction

1420
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:58,450
so select for x

1421
01:29:58,470 --> 01:29:59,590
in turn

1422
01:29:59,590 --> 01:30:01,070
the column from y

1423
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:04,080
but most reduces this error

1424
01:30:04,130 --> 01:30:09,520
user here until we have the desired to the desired number of columns in x

1425
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:12,340
now it turns out

1426
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:13,960
to minimize this area

1427
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:15,610
it should be if x sorry

1428
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:21,000
we compose x by extracting the columns of y which have the largest variance now

1429
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,170
what is going to derive the algorithm

1430
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:30,070
and so on

1431
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,120
so the squared distance

1432
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:33,250
that's right of

1433
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,390
square nasty square root sign

1434
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:38,930
so the squared distances the sum

1435
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:42,810
across the dimensions of the square

1436
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:43,680
of the

1437
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:46,060
the difference between the two data points here

1438
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:47,600
so these are scalars now

1439
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:48,920
this is the

1440
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:55,330
i data points k feature is just the sum of the squares for that

1441
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:58,650
now what we can do is we can only three order the columns of y

1442
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:03,230
without affecting the distances so i can just move columns y around without changing the

1443
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:07,210
so will will choose an ordering of y

1444
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,070
to help us in algorithm so

1445
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:10,690
i will say

1446
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:15,020
the first q columns of y those that will best represent the distance matrix by

1447
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:18,610
definition because i can reorder without changing so i'm going to say that the first

1448
01:31:18,610 --> 01:31:19,700
q columns of y

1449
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:25,540
those that i'm going to use for x

1450
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:30,060
what we can do is we can substitute x for y

1451
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:31,380
the first k

1452
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:33,370
so now i x is

1453
01:31:34,410 --> 01:31:37,720
OK cause want to q because of the ordering

1454
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:41,000
this means that we can replace the distance in latent space

1455
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:43,680
which was this delta square

1456
01:31:43,690 --> 01:31:45,060
is equal to x

1457
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:47,180
minus xjx i minus xj

1458
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,460
for the k feature

1459
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:52,010
with the relevant wise for his first q values OK

1460
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:55,920
so this is sort of

1461
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:00,460
the relative orderings notational purely notational if i want to do the ordering

1462
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:05,290
so the ordering ordering like this means that i can rewrite this as k cause

1463
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:06,860
one to q

1464
01:32:06,890 --> 01:32:08,240
over y

1465
01:32:08,270 --> 01:32:10,990
if i was to define an ordering

1466
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:14,740
it was like the last and in the first and then the middle one writing

1467
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:15,900
this some

1468
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:17,370
it would be quite awkward

1469
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:21,710
so it's just simply notational so that i can write this song

1470
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:25,260
equal to this OK

1471
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:30,810
and i can do without loss of generality so that's the nice thing about

1472
01:32:30,850 --> 01:32:33,080
OK so our objective looks like this

1473
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:35,090
well because

1474
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:39,410
we can rewrite the deltas as some of the k cause one to q

1475
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:43,400
and the d is the sum of the chemicals wanted to DD necessarily being larger

1476
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,940
than q

1477
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,170
we can basically rewrite our objective as being k cause q plus one to d

1478
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,420
so the remaining dimensions of y basically the sum

1479
01:32:55,420 --> 01:33:01,850
of the interpoint distances from the dimensions why we've left out

1480
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:05,310
we can then introduce the mean of each dimension and then put it inside these

1481
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:06,400
brackets here

1482
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:09,290
so i've introduced the mean twice so i can do that

1483
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:14,100
it's just a convenient thing so you can see these the form of this

1484
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:16,510
by introducing meaning to here

1485
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:19,980
like that and then multiplying out

1486
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:24,510
that some sorry should be across all these back into terms here that's not very

1487
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,570
should be across all attracted terms

1488
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:34,950
one multiplied allied that i can also bring in some of the farms inside so

1489
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:39,540
that's about all the bracketed terms but here i'm bringing the some inside

1490
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,040
this some applies

1491
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:43,220
not to here

1492
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,060
but does apply to here

1493
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:48,770
they need to have a factor of n appear outside

1494
01:33:49,610 --> 01:33:50,760
guide so

1495
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:55,540
finding the sum over ice over in it doesn't apply to

1496
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,190
this i hear but multiplies it by hand

1497
01:33:58,210 --> 01:34:02,020
so they bring it past this i i factor and out the front and then

1498
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:03,180
i get some

1499
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:05,850
over j appearing in front of this one

1500
01:34:05,850 --> 01:34:08,700
in this case here i get get some of the j there

1501
01:34:08,730 --> 01:34:11,420
and then the sum of the eye drops in

1502
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:12,700
inside here

1503
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:15,540
because there's no ice in this out the term here

1504
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:21,010
similarly i get a factor and appearing outside that guy

1505
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:30,220
what you should notice that

1506
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:34,640
is this looks very similar to the variance in fact is n times the variance

1507
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,090
all of that column

1508
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:39,570
and that's the end times the variance of the j th column that in time

1509
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:44,920
so the case columns and that in time the variance of the k column two

1510
01:34:46,230 --> 01:34:47,950
these guys

1511
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:50,280
so this is the main

1512
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:53,700
this is just the sum over all values both of these guys just go to

1513
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:58,230
because the end up just being the mean minus the mean

1514
01:34:58,230 --> 01:35:01,150
and you some with very thick expectation

1515
01:35:01,150 --> 01:35:04,010
and the actions come from this policy p

1516
01:35:04,030 --> 01:35:08,340
and for convenience we divide by so we can well you which is bounded between

1517
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:09,300
zero and

1518
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,230
so that's the value

1519
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,320
so the expected reward some of an agent p

1520
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,380
which acts

1521
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:19,210
in environment sigma

1522
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:22,110
the goal of the agent should be to maximize its value

1523
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:25,760
it's this

1524
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:27,840
take marks of this round value

1525
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:29,510
are p sigma

1526
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:31,190
and by definition then

1527
01:35:31,210 --> 01:35:33,110
the value of this agent

1528
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:37,550
of p sigma

1529
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:39,340
which is defined as we star

1530
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:42,230
it's larger equal than the value of any other policy

1531
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:44,300
in this environment sigma

1532
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:45,030
i mean

1533
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:48,380
there's nothing really going on

1534
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:52,760
well you can do is i mean policies something complex which depends on the past

1535
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:55,170
and so on you can rule that out

1536
01:35:55,170 --> 01:35:58,980
and if you rolled out let's do it here the value of the optimal value

1537
01:35:59,030 --> 01:36:02,340
environment sigma is just this expectimax sequence

1538
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:03,920
i show you in the next slide

1539
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:07,300
and the optimal action is just you you replace the first

1540
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:09,650
mark's point argmax

1541
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:13,440
so that's a really explicit i mean you have your observation and action spaces which

1542
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:18,610
are not written down there is reverts so there's really no explicit expression of computing

1543
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:19,780
the next action

1544
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:22,710
given the past observations actions

1545
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:24,110
let's call it

1546
01:36:24,130 --> 01:36:27,230
expectimax sequence of three or four

1547
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:30,800
OK so here's the tree

1548
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:35,340
so he written in explicit form

1549
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:38,480
and job by showing you how to write it recursively

1550
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:40,690
and he also write it recursively

1551
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:42,050
so the value

1552
01:36:42,090 --> 01:36:45,260
at the time

1553
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:50,280
OK minus one

1554
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:54,880
the value given the action

1555
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:59,480
and the maximum of the action because you want to take the optimal action

1556
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:01,920
OK you have two actions

1557
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:03,260
so the value

1558
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,530
so these are the

1559
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:07,940
these are the q will use from tavistock and this is the this is the

1560
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:09,610
value of this

1561
01:37:09,670 --> 01:37:12,920
state value function this the state action value function

1562
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:14,150
he's is

1563
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:18,170
so sum of all reworked but you can recursively put in the value

1564
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:21,960
for the future so starting from time k

1565
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:25,460
it is the reward of k and this is all the reverts the future including

1566
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:30,230
the expectations with respect to the optimal policy and then you take expectation

1567
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,550
so we have this recursive expression you know this

1568
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:36,480
together with this

1569
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:39,690
and then you can go on i mean

1570
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:43,400
this is the same as this you just next

1571
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:44,760
the difference

1572
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:47,010
the standards

1573
01:37:47,050 --> 01:37:52,190
notation in reinforcement learning literature they're always talking about state

1574
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:54,150
i didn't talk about state here

1575
01:37:54,170 --> 01:37:55,150
i talk about

1576
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:57,480
only observations actions

1577
01:37:57,530 --> 01:38:01,590
and everything you can depend on the complete history

1578
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:03,250
so i don't need anything

1579
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:07,300
so you can say that the complete history is my state

1580
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:09,820
but this is not really useful

1581
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,070
because i mean if you talk about state have implicit

1582
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:17,190
the idea that space no repeat in time and you get some statistics over the

1583
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:22,820
but history is growing so no history is not observed more than one

1584
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:26,510
so interbreeding then it as a state

1585
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:29,340
it's not really very useful

1586
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:35,360
if you have no environment

1587
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,590
we just plugin

1588
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:40,070
so the environment is always move you plug in the first six months

1589
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:41,760
and we have done

1590
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:47,010
so if you move the optimal policy in the sense that no other policy for

1591
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:49,780
an agent to hire me expect revived

1592
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,420
and the mean expectations what you want because move the true distribution so

1593
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:55,900
the problem is solved

1594
01:38:55,940 --> 01:39:00,170
apart from some computational problems

1595
01:39:00,190 --> 01:39:01,980
which i will ignore

1596
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:05,650
it concludes even game

1597
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:08,070
very except for instance

1598
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:12,480
you could model your environment is an optimal chess player i mean optimum minimax player

1599
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:16,530
plays some deterministic game for deterministic

1600
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:24,530
in fact is also probability distribution is concentrated on one

1601
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:26,050
on one policy

1602
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:31,760
OK so i mentioned there is no principle problem in computing the actions as long

1603
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,960
as the movie is known

1604
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:35,730
the spaces

1605
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:40,860
and computable the spaces x y finite horizon

1606
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:44,150
of course a huge practical problem and we all know that

1607
01:39:44,170 --> 01:39:45,320
i mean you can do

1608
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,780
minimax in ingest up to the end

1609
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:51,610
but this is about from the oceans and especially about the philosophical foundations and so

1610
01:39:51,650 --> 01:39:54,260
will ignore this computation

1611
01:39:54,610 --> 01:39:58,690
because one first we should get the foundations right

1612
01:39:59,510 --> 01:40:01,070
but is still not done

1613
01:40:01,090 --> 01:40:05,010
things drastically change if it is not known

1614
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:08,710
and that's the real if cut real life case built the robot throw it

1615
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,780
somewhere and it should work

1616
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:13,820
we don't have you

1617
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:18,440
precise description of moon or even a probabilistic one

1618
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,230
OK so what we do is

1619
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:21,230
if you listen

1620
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:24,030
the other part of my talk the natural thing is now OK let's go to

1621
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:25,400
the basement

1622
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:27,860
new unknown

1623
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:34,090
i mean reinforcement learning you often go to temporal difference learning you do all kinds

1624
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:39,750
of things which sometimes work in limited environments but i mean

1625
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,710
two principles are generally

1626
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:46,190
so let's use the bayesian approach and replace the true distribution by the mixture distribution

1627
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:52,360
assuming that the class and contains move as usual

1628
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:54,380
so that's the same as before

1629
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:59,340
the likelihood times the priors some or all the environment and the only difference is

1630
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:02,440
that now everything is conditioned on the action

1631
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:06,920
that makes all the difference for proving things

1632
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:10,070
and the sum is one of

1633
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:15,090
and again it can be interpreted as the prior belief is

1634
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:16,460
these weights

1635
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:19,090
and so on

1636
01:41:19,090 --> 01:41:22,780
OK so which question can be asked now

1637
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:24,920
the first

1638
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:27,530
its national now to follow the

1639
01:41:27,530 --> 01:41:30,940
bayes optimal policy based on the basis p c

1640
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:32,920
o which maximizes the

1641
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:34,130
the value

1642
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:37,440
in analogy to the pretty prediction case

1643
01:41:41,030 --> 01:41:46,460
but what really care about is the true expected value so what we

1644
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:51,800
mu expectation to environment if you use this policy so this

1645
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:56,010
i mean we use this quantity for determining the policy but this quantity is what

1646
01:41:56,010 --> 01:41:58,570
we really care about

1647
01:41:59,630 --> 01:42:01,990
the optimal policy obviously

1648
01:42:02,010 --> 01:42:07,900
your optimum value but we don't know we don't have to optimal policy because we

1649
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:09,440
don't know

1650
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:15,340
so we follow this policy now we can ask their policies uniform with uniformly larger

1651
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:18,240
when i show you like with very short ways you might think

1652
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:22,790
that you'll see blue light violet light and when i show you like very long

1653
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:25,360
wavelength you may think that you will see red light

1654
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:27,630
and that is often the case

1655
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:29,990
but not always

1656
01:42:31,670 --> 01:42:32,270
as a start

1657
01:42:33,710 --> 01:42:37,970
we all know that you can produce all the colors that you want to buy mixing lights

1658
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:39,830
mixing the light of

1659
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:42,740
so so-called three primary colors recall that

1660
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:49,050
additive mixing not to be confused with subtractive mixing which is the mixing of paint

1661
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:50,260
i'm talking about

1662
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:52,990
additive mixing mixing of light

1663
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,120
i can mix red light this

1664
01:42:57,690 --> 01:42:58,360
the green light

1665
01:42:59,150 --> 01:43:00,710
and i can make you see yellow light

1666
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:01,960
even though

1667
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:03,680
the wavelength of yellow

1668
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:05,180
it's not president

1669
01:43:06,110 --> 01:43:07,720
this the whole idea about quality vi

1670
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:09,630
which is three electron guns

1671
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:12,320
and your computer monitors operate

1672
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:13,580
in the same way

1673
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:16,540
let's look a little closer

1674
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:17,620
at these

1675
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:20,540
three primary colors of additive

1676
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:23,570
and i'll show you a slide

1677
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:26,230
of what we call the color triangle

1678
01:43:27,930 --> 01:43:30,230
it is called a triangle in a way is a recipe

1679
01:43:31,470 --> 01:43:33,450
four how you can make these various colors

1680
01:43:34,650 --> 01:43:35,460
using this three

1681
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:37,460
primary colours red

1682
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:46,790
so you see

1683
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:48,870
at the three corners of this triangle

1684
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:50,410
you see

1685
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:52,380
red green and blue

1686
01:43:53,710 --> 01:43:54,290
read here

1687
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:55,440
really at the top

1688
01:43:56,140 --> 01:43:56,850
and you see below

1689
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:58,790
at the on the corner

1690
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:03,280
and i will make here a poor man's version of the same triangle

1691
01:44:03,910 --> 01:44:05,150
very schematically

1692
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:09,530
o no it should really be more of a triangle

1693
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:12,240
like this

1694
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:15,780
and so we have the uh

1695
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:16,590
green here

1696
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:20,310
and we have the red here

1697
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:24,700
and all and we have the blue you

1698
01:44:28,710 --> 01:44:30,550
now suppose we want to make yellow

1699
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:32,310
which you see here

1700
01:44:34,530 --> 01:44:35,660
so does this point here

1701
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,250
then what you do

1702
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:42,820
reporting this much read

1703
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:46,890
away from the red from this point today on the corner

1704
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:48,770
and you put in this much green

1705
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:50,770
and then you'll see yellow

1706
01:44:52,750 --> 01:44:54,030
if you make this call here

1707
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,660
which would be based on greensboro

1708
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:00,470
you draw three lines from the three corners

1709
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:07,880
you put in this much read

1710
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:11,610
annual put in this much green

1711
01:45:13,050 --> 01:45:14,420
and you put in this micro

1712
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:16,620
you'll get that color

1713
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:21,180
and so you see we will even be able to make something that looks very close to white light

1714
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:24,440
by mixing the three primary colors the right ratio

1715
01:45:24,990 --> 01:45:25,500
and that's what

1716
01:45:26,110 --> 01:45:27,080
the basis behind here

1717
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:28,500
quality feet

1718
01:45:31,190 --> 01:45:31,830
i have here

1719
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:33,240
little box

1720
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,840
and in that little box i have

1721
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:38,170
light bulbs

1722
01:45:42,190 --> 01:45:42,530
and below

1723
01:45:44,370 --> 01:45:45,180
and i can

1724
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:46,510
make an attempt

1725
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:48,960
to make some calls four u

1726
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:52,390
so here

1727
01:45:52,990 --> 01:45:53,610
becomes the red

1728
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:56,410
the is yet to be read

1729
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,360
and i can change intensity little

1730
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:03,260
and here's the group

1731
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,390
and here's the green and the intensity intensity

1732
01:46:07,290 --> 01:46:10,240
now suppose i make green and red already looks pretty yellow

1733
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:12,420
a little bit amount of

1734
01:46:13,190 --> 01:46:15,360
taste but you see only have green and red

1735
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:17,050
so i'm operating there

1736
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:18,940
on the right side here

1737
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:21,660
and i'm seeing now

1738
01:46:22,570 --> 01:46:23,730
yellow i can also make

1739
01:46:24,830 --> 01:46:25,540
purple for u

1740
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:27,860
this is now we know somewhere here

1741
01:46:28,830 --> 01:46:30,490
and i can also go to the purple size

1742
01:46:30,970 --> 01:46:31,470
you only have

1743
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:34,190
and read

1744
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:36,030
it is the blue

1745
01:46:36,610 --> 01:46:40,620
all too many william green so this is the blue and the red

1746
01:46:41,350 --> 01:46:42,080
makes that a little

1747
01:46:43,110 --> 01:46:44,200
i can make a nice couple

1748
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:46,590
you guessed it already

1749
01:46:47,070 --> 01:46:48,050
turn them all three on

1750
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:52,210
andy changed a little bit intensities you come close to white

1751
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:53,920
so now we're somewhere here

1752
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:55,510
so i put it next in

1753
01:46:55,990 --> 01:46:58,140
of these three colors so this is something

1754
01:46:59,100 --> 01:46:59,830
that is boring

1755
01:47:03,490 --> 01:47:04,600
of no interest to u

1756
01:47:06,190 --> 01:47:07,220
and you didn't come here

1757
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:08,820
to learn about

1758
01:47:09,310 --> 01:47:09,970
the qualifying

1759
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:16,790
now discomfiting come something that may surprise you

1760
01:47:18,580 --> 01:47:20,470
something that you may never have heard of

1761
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:24,270
and something that is not covered in physics textbooks

1762
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:26,820
and that's

1763
01:47:27,370 --> 01:47:29,010
that you can actually see colors

1764
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:30,410
using only

1765
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:31,520
black and white

1766
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:33,770
almost only black white

1767
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:38,820
and what i want to show you now is a very famous demonstration which was

1768
01:47:39,050 --> 01:47:41,500
done in early fifty by edwin land

1769
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:45,190
the phenomenon was known before edwin but

1770
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:45,980
he really

1771
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:48,850
push issue very hard

1772
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:52,790
he gave me personally two slides

1773
01:47:53,410 --> 01:47:54,410
they're both black and white

1774
01:47:54,830 --> 01:47:55,930
you will see very shortly

1775
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:58,970
and this light of exactly the same scene

1776
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,720
one of these slides

1777
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:02,730
it took

1778
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,730
through a red filter in front of the camera was a red filter

1779
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:07,980
but she

1780
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:11,980
man it's a black-and-white slide so there's no random slide of course

1781
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,540
both slides

1782
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:15,020
and white

1783
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:17,810
in a short interview

1784
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,140
to do that i have to walk back

1785
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:21,130
the audience

1786
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,400
and i'm going to make it very dark

1787
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:25,390
we are the load a screen

1788
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:28,520
and we're going to look at these slides

1789
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:38,260
i already is close enough

1790
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:44,870
so you can slide number one

1791
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:52,390
a clown

1792
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:56,480
and i can show you like number two

1793
01:48:57,020 --> 01:49:00,610
slide number this this is a black-and-white slide this by the way is the slides

1794
01:49:01,190 --> 01:49:01,960
that was taken

1795
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:06,370
through a red filter but of course there's no read the slide it's a black-and-white slide

1796
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:14,100
this was not taken through any filter

1797
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:17,170
taken from the same

1798
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:20,290
two black-and-white slides

1799
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:25,420
you could turn ask yourself now the question what happened if u

1800
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:27,820
hold a red filter in front of

1801
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:30,770
this one slide i show you only one now

1802
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:35,060
the one that was taken by edwin land through a red filter what would you

1803
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:37,220
see a few put a red filter in front of it

1804
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:42,800
well you'll see something very boring you'll see something that all children are familiar with

1805
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,700
namely you look at the world through a red filter

1806
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:48,770
and if i'm trying to do that in real time so fun for about twenty

1807
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:50,040
five frames per second

1808
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:53,520
even the fastest computer around

1809
01:49:53,570 --> 01:49:59,630
if you're not careful classifier using real probability that so that's sort of like the

1810
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:04,080
fitting issues zero and that's just the translation and scale

1811
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:06,000
born do anything more advanced

1812
01:50:06,010 --> 01:50:09,830
forget about it for this sort of this sort of like exhaustive search stops starts

1813
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:13,880
feeding is really important

1814
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:15,880
so that

1815
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:20,280
this this reactor in what i said it's important message the y one it's an

1816
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:26,090
object tries make it useful the object template it's important to understand how the thing

1817
01:50:26,090 --> 01:50:30,020
is performed first before thinking about which classifier we use

1818
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:34,590
from a machine learning toolbox and a key understanding of the assumptions and constraints in

1819
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:42,140
vision is required before applying effective learning techniques

1820
01:50:42,230 --> 01:50:45,280
so now i will start with what functions now

1821
01:50:45,320 --> 01:50:48,080
as i said what function is basically

1822
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:54,590
and you can come the form the far arbitrarily this is a patient is for

1823
01:50:54,630 --> 01:50:55,810
people can take note of that

1824
01:50:55,860 --> 01:51:04,020
one of the following and things that people but essentially going essentially what function is

1825
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:06,680
anything that takes

1826
01:51:06,710 --> 01:51:07,690
the source coordinates

1827
01:51:07,710 --> 01:51:11,290
and for the for the purposes of

1828
01:51:11,350 --> 01:51:15,060
yeah i think nearly all the all the top of the talk someone to give

1829
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:18,040
will be referring to the coordinates

1830
01:51:18,090 --> 01:51:22,160
equally there will be functions the three d coordinates that will be dealing with three

1831
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:23,760
quarters for now

1832
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:29,190
essentially just one to map from my source coordinates to my destination court and you

1833
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:31,130
can see this is in the final

1834
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:35,390
and one of the biggest change in translation little bit rotation

1835
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,990
there's no scale change anything in here

1836
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:39,530
and the

1837
01:51:39,550 --> 01:51:42,150
the other important thing to note on this function

1838
01:51:42,150 --> 01:51:45,900
is that the value is my warping function x

1839
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:47,740
might would say corner here

1840
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:48,780
and p

1841
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:52,890
p is actually the way there are parameterize the war

1842
01:51:52,890 --> 01:51:56,340
so so one way to parameterize wall

1843
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:04,300
as well

1844
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:06,770
because the troll here or here

1845
01:52:09,270 --> 01:52:16,300
so nothing to involve about like a really really really simple warping function would be

1846
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:23,740
really really simple warping function will be now this x here is also

1847
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:25,690
it it's about to basically two d

1848
01:52:25,700 --> 01:52:27,450
four so

1849
01:52:27,490 --> 01:52:33,090
let's do this sort of the vector x

1850
01:52:33,110 --> 01:52:35,130
but when y here

1851
01:52:35,140 --> 01:52:39,590
and essentially a really basic warping function would just be translation so

1852
01:52:39,610 --> 01:52:40,580
so far but

1853
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:51,000
actually won why me writing that would just be

1854
01:52:51,210 --> 01:52:54,160
x y

1855
01:52:58,770 --> 01:53:02,530
he that p is typically to

1856
01:53:02,630 --> 01:53:03,830
p that

1857
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,000
is p one

1858
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:07,130
p two

1859
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:10,130
so cameron say that is that there are other too small

1860
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:15,010
so that's very simple but the discounting cue because the field of what will be

1861
01:53:15,010 --> 01:53:23,000
function is so parameterizing how much corn exchange from my ten so always this never

1862
01:53:23,930 --> 01:53:28,580
so this is might imply a point of reference for these points never change the

1863
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:31,640
thing that changes is the warping function of how

1864
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:33,940
i relied might imply points

1865
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:35,490
two something the source image

1866
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:36,240
and so

1867
01:53:36,250 --> 01:53:37,340
my goal

1868
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:42,260
really is for me if i know how how on parameterizing the change to the

1869
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:43,800
template in the source image

1870
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:46,580
my goal is to find p

1871
01:53:46,590 --> 01:53:52,680
so essentially this is this is my first kind of domain crafting coming in so

1872
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:53,720
instead of me

1873
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:55,880
learning perhaps what he should be

1874
01:53:56,310 --> 01:54:02,680
i'm actually defining beforehand and is actually we do actually live he later on but

1875
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:07,070
for all but for now let's say that are either on piece of p is

1876
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:12,950
a little more complicated one would be say

1877
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,650
in the final

1878
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:16,510
people familiar with the finals

1879
01:54:16,630 --> 01:54:20,080
with the final

1880
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:21,740
it might be slightly different

1881
01:54:21,790 --> 01:54:24,340
because what i do with the final

1882
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:26,160
is that

1883
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:30,460
so this i i've got

1884
01:54:30,510 --> 01:54:35,060
and the final is typically defined by three points

1885
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:38,170
so to say this is x one

1886
01:54:38,170 --> 01:54:39,690
so is x two

1887
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:42,510
this is x three x one x two x three in terms of the vector

1888
01:54:42,510 --> 01:54:44,940
form so the x and y positions

1889
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,650
things there

1890
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:50,200
i want to walk to say

1891
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:52,670
so obviously there a little bit change their

1892
01:54:52,710 --> 01:54:53,650
x y

1893
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:55,150
x two

1894
01:54:55,170 --> 01:54:57,730
extreme so on

1895
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:03,060
the typical way to do that with enough on what is and it's very easy

1896
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:06,810
if you go to matlab or anything else you goes to very very simple least

1897
01:55:06,810 --> 01:55:13,420
squares why do that in basically we use homogeneous coordinates the this and it's really

1898
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:18,030
elegant solution rather than kind of saying what's the translation what's rotation what's the scaling

1899
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:21,210
everything that this a really simple way to do this

1900
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:25,770
and this is what it is is basically i put this into one matrix same

1901
01:55:25,770 --> 01:55:27,730
as my source coordinates

1902
01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:29,260
x one

1903
01:55:29,290 --> 01:55:30,420
so that's it

1904
01:55:30,430 --> 01:55:33,970
that's the treaty what's rightfully

1905
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,710
one two one

1906
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,590
three one

1907
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:43,670
that's my source coordinates source one matrix

1908
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:46,320
and got my destination

1909
01:55:46,340 --> 01:55:47,590
x one dash

1910
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:49,160
while in dash

1911
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:51,700
xt that

1912
01:55:51,740 --> 01:55:52,490
y two

1913
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:55,220
x three

1914
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:57,240
y three that one

1915
01:55:58,530 --> 01:56:01,700
and if i want to know the mapping between here and here

1916
01:56:01,740 --> 01:56:03,380
all i need to do

1917
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:06,530
but but i just like that

1918
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:15,360
the important foundation of pure matrix theory

1919
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,710
namely a linear programming

1920
01:56:19,270 --> 01:56:21,560
from our viewpoint

1921
01:56:21,570 --> 01:56:28,210
and a matrix a is especially structured

1922
01:56:28,210 --> 01:56:30,070
class of polytopes

1923
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:34,290
there any

1924
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:37,370
almost any book and combinatorial optimisation

1925
01:56:37,370 --> 01:56:39,150
well presented you

1926
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:42,270
with the kind of thing i'm talking about today

1927
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:43,800
i will present

1928
01:56:43,850 --> 01:56:46,210
well the answer

1929
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:50,430
matrix theory from the viewpoint of

1930
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:53,870
polly matroids that is matroids as

1931
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:03,470
and polytope now it's not normally give in this way but that's

1932
01:57:03,490 --> 01:57:06,880
paper one of those papers just mention gives it this way

1933
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:10,210
and these are pollinate right

1934
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:13,640
ground set

1935
01:57:13,710 --> 01:57:18,970
set of nonnegative integer valued vectors

1936
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:20,980
according to space e

1937
01:57:21,060 --> 01:57:23,520
it's going to turn out of this is going to turn out to be a

1938
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:33,200
by the way we define down defining it here is as a direct

1939
01:57:33,210 --> 01:57:37,400
direct imitation of our definition of matroids

1940
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:44,520
which was a direct imitation of the basis column bases of the matrix

1941
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:53,570
and this is the maltese

1942
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:54,950
and lord

1943
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:59,330
is the class

1944
01:58:00,130 --> 01:58:05,070
independent factor the independent vectors which are a

1945
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:09,990
the analogue of the the independent sets of a matroid

1946
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:11,890
in thirty origins

1947
01:58:12,930 --> 01:58:15,050
representing the empty set

1948
01:58:15,070 --> 01:58:18,230
for any nonnegative integer value

1949
01:58:19,070 --> 01:58:23,120
vector which is independent

1950
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:24,520
it is

1951
01:58:25,970 --> 01:58:28,210
less than or equal

1952
01:58:28,210 --> 01:58:30,630
some other vector

1953
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:33,100
which is an independent

1954
01:58:33,150 --> 01:58:35,070
then it's in independence

1955
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:37,150
we say this again

1956
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:40,760
any nonnegative integer vector is

1957
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:47,280
if is less than or equal to some other back to that in end

1958
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:50,620
this is the analogue of the subset of independent

1959
01:58:50,710 --> 01:58:53,720
subset of an infinite set is and then

1960
01:58:53,730 --> 01:58:55,600
and here the

1961
01:58:55,610 --> 01:58:57,800
interesting condition

1962
01:59:00,010 --> 01:59:02,450
corresponding every base has been found

1963
01:59:02,450 --> 01:59:06,200
size for any nonnegative integer vector y

1964
01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:11,000
every maximal integer vector that's independent

1965
01:59:11,050 --> 01:59:14,700
and less than or equal to the vector y

1966
01:59:14,730 --> 01:59:17,830
has the same sum

1967
01:59:19,650 --> 01:59:22,450
it's called the rank of the vector y

1968
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:24,540
so we define rank

1969
01:59:25,970 --> 01:59:28,150
any integer valued vector

1970
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:37,620
the rank of the are not nominated for any non negative integers right

1971
01:59:37,630 --> 01:59:40,080
the rank is

1972
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:43,200
the size of the

1973
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:47,830
maximal integer vector which is less than

1974
01:59:48,950 --> 01:59:52,360
independent factor which is less than

1975
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:59,370
well polymatroid just leave out the word integer say everything here

1976
01:59:59,390 --> 02:00:03,210
say everything here without the word integer and you

1977
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:08,430
pollinator there's no reason to have

1978
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:09,640
in reality

1979
02:00:09,650 --> 02:00:12,170
to make this work other than

1980
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:16,640
polymatroids preserving
