1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,470
sixteen minus one

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,950
i actually represent

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,870
negative to the fifteen and negative fourteen thirty two forty five hundred ninety two to

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,160
fifteen to two fifteen one is one that makes sense and everything centered around zero

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,000
so i was just as many representations for negative numbers as i have positive

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,730
makes sense

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:25,790
OK so let's start doing some really simple code not the code normally right sometimes

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,720
you do not very often which is to understand what happens when you do something

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,720
like this

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,040
the hard variables

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,530
c h and i said it was capital

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,660
and then i have been very called i actually making a short

13
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:56,990
as i said it was clear you don't need cast for that

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,490
what you really doing it just sitting as equal to whatever number is backing chr

15
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,170
question there

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,250
o o

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,510
o i just wrong to either and i said you would i wanted this just

18
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,230
didn't change the drawn word

19
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,730
OK so i did not want to this year

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,000
but in the composition of the time i thought it was

21
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,070
OK this makes sense to people

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,790
certainly that's going to compile and it's going to execute and based on the other

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,700
seven borders drawn and you should have some idea as to what's going to happen

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,510
in response to this line

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,520
printer press the equivalent of a cl statement

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,040
but it's in pure c

27
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,230
and i want to print out short

28
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,450
actually limits UCL

29
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:57,350
western less as less than last year MDL

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,470
in response to that i expected to print out the number sixty five

31
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,250
so to the console i would expect that to be printed why is that the

32
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,110
case because the declaration c h

33
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,590
doesn't put capital in there

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,560
it puts the

35
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,300
the integer valued that's it

36
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,910
which i will draw that small you know really one zeros and so one time

37
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,560
for you to assign to

38
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,850
that's what happens

39
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,280
in order to achieve the effect the assignment it will copy this pattern and this

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,680
is what really does electronically it just replicates whatever bit patterns right here

41
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,760
on the that space right there some years these bits on the this little by

42
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,280
like peanut butter

43
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,800
and sixty five down there and all the extra space

44
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,040
it's just patterns in this case with zero and so that's how sixty five goes

45
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,310
from a one but representation two two by representation

46
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,800
that makes sense

47
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,730
i simplified this a little bit

48
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,100
when it was sixty five down here

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,580
and is sixty five and there i happen no that the leftmost bit

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,110
it is zero there

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,100
it's positive numbers that to surprise OK

52
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,520
the matrix people

53
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,610
what happens if i do

54
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,600
the opposite direction

55
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,500
i do

56
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,680
so we're not

57
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,910
short polymer

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,290
programme as is equal to also sixty seven

59
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,640
and i do that

60
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,910
it compiles there's no cast needed

61
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,950
as far as how the sixty seven is laid down

62
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,750
zero one zero zero zero zero one one

63
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,960
two more than sixty five obviously

64
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,950
it has an extra by of zero

65
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,840
and this is as someone CA schizoid and memory

66
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,590
and it is signed as

67
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:20,810
two by information and sixteen bits can not somehow be wedged astronomically into an eight

68
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,050
bit pattern

69
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,330
so what you see in c plus plus in many programming languages for that matter

70
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,870
do is they simply punt on the stuff they don't have room for

71
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,660
and they assume that if you're signing a large number two is smaller one and

72
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,340
the smaller ones can only accommodate has a certain ring device in the first place

73
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,770
that you're interested in the minutiae of the lower bits

74
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,060
so make sense to people

75
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,390
so what happens is that replicates this right here

76
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:56,710
and once on this and this is how when you do this right

77
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,740
OK you go ahead and you print out

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,590
a c

79
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,120
OK now i'm kind of a borehole negative number fine but negative negative values don't

80
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,800
work to all characters because unsigned cars

81
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,780
most characters are unsigned so you actually do get all positive values in with the

82
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,360
representations you know enough about shorts

83
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,020
to know the two by figures i've already told you that long interlaced in our

84
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,740
world or four bytes to just the four by equivalent of the short

85
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,410
so let me deal with this example

86
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:39,970
i go ahead and i do short

87
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,100
and is equal to on to say

88
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,780
when we this way now the not longest-running this

89
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,980
two return was to very close to the year that of course is not real

90
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,310
see but is running because i want to be clear about what the bit pattern

91
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,260
for numbering statistical whatever number that adds up to

92
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,780
as being stored in as

93
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:12,070
OK this is to be a to one zero zero here by all zeros parts

94
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,930
of zero

95
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,130
one zero zero one

96
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,830
by taking in the city called as

97
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,330
the same argument that i made in the car to short assignment

98
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,170
it can be taken here

99
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,020
this is found this is somehow less surprising because both of them represent integers is

100
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,800
all zeros all zeros

101
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,770
lots of zeros followed by one zero zero zero zero zero zero one zero

102
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,950
and that's why does have a lot more space to represent the same small number

103
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,560
trick question

104
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:54,480
but in i equal to i have thirty two bits available to me to represent

105
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,180
a pretty big numbers

106
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,540
so do that

107
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,110
two to the

108
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:06,500
twenty third of two the twenty first wants to the fifty

109
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,420
plus let's say

110
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,620
OK to be quite

111
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,610
the liberal in my

112
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,200
power of two

113
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,110
representations numbers because seven always means that the body

114
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,240
OK to the fifty pieces of one right there

115
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,140
to the

116
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,330
so we're where we time last time

117
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,880
they had discovered the radiation and going back to lecture four notes because i think

118
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,790
i have a little bit the last time lecture four notes

119
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,330
we discovered that the radiation

120
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,320
behaves like a particles

121
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:54,570
and it behaves like a particle as exhibited in the the photoelectric effect

122
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,800
that is in order to get an electron out

123
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,150
what we needed to do was to put our article

124
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,550
of energy we needed to put up a packet of energy we need to put

125
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,990
up wants

126
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,970
and energy

127
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,370
and as long as

128
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,290
quantum of energy packet of energy particle of energy

129
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,920
it was larger than the work function we would get

130
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:27,090
one electron out for every packet we put in

131
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:35,890
so that's an example of the particle like nature to radiation this for electrical that

132
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,120
right but

133
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,780
i i also

134
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,090
when i to show

135
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,590
even more

136
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,800
convincing property

137
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:51,210
the particle like nature of radiation are full-time

138
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,620
and that is the and he showed

139
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,150
a photon has momentum

140
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,790
even though for time

141
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,160
does not have a mayor

142
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,630
four essentially no rest

143
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,990
and of course momentum is very particle like property right

144
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,690
comments from hey

145
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,840
four moments

146
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,570
it is equal to the mass times velocity

147
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,360
if a particle

148
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,030
or if the photo

149
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,330
if radiation has momentum well

150
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,640
acting very much like the particle

151
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,990
right how you do this well

152
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:43,620
einstein took the relativistic equations of motion which he himself wrote down

153
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,730
and what he showed from there

154
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,190
is there a full-time

155
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,710
here and momentum p here

156
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,700
and the moment some of the photo

157
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,560
was defined by

158
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,260
the frequency of the radiation

159
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:04,150
that is that moment of which is given by h

160
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,440
again one constant fear that quantization constant

161
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,610
times the frequency

162
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,470
over the speed of light

163
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,650
and since of course we know the relationship

164
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,450
between the

165
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,850
frequency and wavelength

166
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,100
we can write the momentum of the photon

167
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,320
and he

168
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,620
over lambda

169
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,350
so if you have radiation

170
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,000
of some wavelengths lambda one

171
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,950
the radiation

172
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,630
both both times

173
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,770
at this moment some eight

174
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:46,930
over lambda this photon momentum even though photons don't have their

175
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,130
and the actual demonstration of this took a few more years experiments we took a

176
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,100
few more years

177
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,880
and it was demonstrated

178
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,420
first in something called the and that

179
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,150
which was the interaction of an x-ray photon with some matter

180
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,200
and you could see it transfer momentum

181
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:17,240
i got to show you a this website from the university of colorado

182
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,690
here this is just a a

183
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,750
you know time down here shooting photons and here is the enemy and i'm coming

184
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,680
at you

185
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:36,130
and you're shooting this vote and then turned you can repel that the have make

186
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,320
it go the other direction because the photo and at the moment because of the

187
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,170
momentum of the photon

188
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,740
but of course if you

189
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:49,020
lower the power and you're not really good with your fingers you get clobbered right

190
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,020
so here now i'm going to try this again this is goal

191
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,970
almost too easy

192
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,690
OK so now i will or the power so that the rate of the photons

193
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,670
are coming

194
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,410
much slower and i'm going to be able to turn this guy around

195
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,650
no problem there we go

196
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,820
repel the right off

197
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,100
so if it really is the case that means you can get it here

198
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:22,780
i i would say well you we better game that i am

199
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:30,150
it was it's just that number what i'm showing you here

200
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,990
they have to lead to

201
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,310
the experimental feeding of atom traffic

202
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,720
no tracking and adam in space

203
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:45,050
how they do their well what they did was they took some unsuspecting yet

204
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,650
and they came in with

205
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,160
full-time laser beam high power laser beam

206
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,420
erected in this way and of course there

207
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,740
push the atoms they pushed them down

208
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,190
but now if you come in

209
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,400
with the laser beam in that direction all the photon momentum going to push the

210
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,130
enemy up now you constraint in this dimension

211
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,060
and you do it

212
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,660
another laser beam this way and another one this way and i constraint in this

213
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,010
dimension you the laser beam in this way and always has been playing constraint on

214
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,670
the third dimension eight

215
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,440
he's trapped in the anime in space

216
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,950
the photon momentum

217
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:32,600
this is what the chewing and inferred and bill phillips next

218
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:38,510
i did are in the middle nineteen nineties and see the nobel prize for this

219
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,290
atom trapping here

220
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:46,050
in nineteen seventy seven know nineteen ninety seven sorry

221
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,530
a photon has momentum

222
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:56,150
and the reason this is so important to reason this experiment was also so important

223
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,010
is because

224
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,220
it is the first

225
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,820
and producing a bullseye einstein condensate

226
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,700
above einstein condensate

227
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,340
where you take

228
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,750
and and don't which has

229
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,770
which is the balls and actually

230
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,680
and new cool it down

231
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,840
such low temperatures

232
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,650
that they can dance

233
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,960
that these items then

234
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,350
so you've got to cool it down very much so you have to get to

235
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,070
the micro kelvin range

236
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,650
and the first thing cooling in and down this

237
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:41,110
so the problem with this is that this subject here

238
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:47,010
it is not very well behaved because it's it's it's discrete

239
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,150
and so

240
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,670
you don't become perform gradient descent in all sorts of things and that's what people

241
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:56,460
have been replacing the subject but other objectives for example the sum of the absolute

242
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,820
values of the WI which people called the the l one norm of some kind

243
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,670
of differentiable function

244
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,030
that uses

245
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,460
that performs basically the same thing

246
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:16,610
and so then minimize johnson it the primary the second of the secondary objective

247
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,130
one very popular

248
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,320
algorithm that uses this principle is the so-called and one SVM

249
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,320
and it's a version of the SVM where the musician of the square numbers being

250
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,690
replaced by the

251
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,920
minimisation of the one norm so the sum of the WI

252
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,400
and so it can be considered in some way in embedded method because

253
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,670
it returns in the end

254
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,780
predictor that gives you a prediction on

255
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,280
a new examples if you want and it also returns

256
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,280
a certain number of

257
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,590
the features that have not been discarded because some of the weights will

258
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,220
be exactly zero

259
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,930
so the difference between the regular SVM

260
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,630
and the other one is the and is that the algorithm drives the sum of

261
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,350
the weights to zero

262
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,280
so how how does this happen it's not always very intuitive to understand so have

263
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,480
a mechanical interpretation

264
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:29,470
yes thank you for clarifying that it true that this this particular algorithm works for

265
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,750
only linearity

266
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,590
on this figure illustrating

267
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,430
the classical way in which we view

268
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,100
regularized optimisations

269
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,600
we think of them as minimizing the cost functions

270
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,360
plus long that some regularizers

271
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,110
and in this figure here i'm showing two on two weights w one and w

272
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,090
assume that the

273
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,320
the optimal solutions

274
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,260
without regularisation is called w star

275
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,890
and we assume that you have a quadratic

276
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,100
objective like for instance what you doing

277
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,640
in rich regression

278
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,010
in this case

279
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,820
as you go away from the optimal solution

280
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,570
you go up in in the probability

281
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,320
and the regularizer

282
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,280
can think can be thought of as the spring

283
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,030
your solution to

284
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,860
zero with the spring strength of long

285
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,020
so this is the classical way people

286
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,800
usually a few regularisation

287
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,340
now you can

288
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:43,780
you can change the way you're thinking instead of thinking you know we want to

289
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:51,520
minimize its primary objective which is to the original objective function this function plus summarize

290
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,570
the primary objective is not the regularizer which is that in the case of the

291
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,850
one norm minimize the sum of the double

292
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,420
these are in the the case of the so-called zero anomaly minimize the number of

293
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,970
this is now

294
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,850
a primary objective plus whatever and

295
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,800
the old primary objective which is really your prediction error

296
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,390
you can represent it in the same way except now the ball you know is

297
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,360
drive your to zero and the what your spring is what

298
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,170
you to your solution

299
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:37,350
so i i doing this crazy thing was just because it's easier than to understand

300
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,670
what the one norm SVM and the lasso does so the last so

301
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,100
is to the one norm SVM

302
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:55,070
basically the last was the this square version of the one norm is

303
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,050
the ridge regression is the

304
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,230
this version of the

305
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,940
two enormous and the last so is the

306
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,510
one of reason version

307
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,460
one version of the regression case

308
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:15,340
i'm just saying that rather than the classification problem because for

309
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,810
again the mechanical interpretation since it's easier to understand

310
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,180
so what you see in the case of the one norm

311
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,630
is that again results weights w one w two

312
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,990
and now

313
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:35,590
or regularize which was before to no answer was kind of problem now it's the

314
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,140
because of the absolute value

315
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,970
and the other part of the objective is the same as before is this spring

316
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,810
that flows into the solution

317
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:55,380
so imagine that you have to be done in you know big box and you

318
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,650
have some force

319
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,320
which is the spring here that the tools will be

320
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,340
if you you know you you shake a little bit you know box

321
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,360
what's going to happen is that you will be is going to rule somewhere to

322
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,390
pool of course but by of course

323
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,350
and we're going to end up going to professional you end up on the face

324
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:25,750
or in on one hand showing corner easily see that you can easily slide into

325
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,730
either an edge or into a corner

326
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:34,680
and this is what happens in this optimisation was the one norm

327
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,890
what happens is that you end up

328
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,380
the solution that is on one of the axis

329
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,610
most of the large fraction of the of the weights are going to be exactly

330
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,610
zero in that solution

331
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,540
but the does this is not the because if the both zero

332
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,020
you are what we call the prime maximum

333
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,500
one is the first time that this one becomes zero in the downstairs not zero

334
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
it is when this is why

335
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,960
and it is zero then goes

336
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,270
and that's why

337
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
then of course

338
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,240
i would have my first zero so that the that year

339
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,600
that my first

340
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,210
that is the case

341
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,070
when n

342
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,700
divided by two is by

343
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,050
so that means when delta

344
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:27,770
divided by

345
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,600
now i go to

346
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,200
this equation

347
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,250
and i put your for delta

348
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,090
two pi

349
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,020
divided by n

350
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,640
and what you see that

351
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,280
that sin theta

352
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,290
becomes lab divided by

353
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,700
is now

354
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,530
that divided by andy

355
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:51,610
in other words this point here

356
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,960
in terms of sin theta which of course is the same as angle

357
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,540
data in radiance because these angles are small

358
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,530
but it isn't

359
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,140
i mentioned plot

360
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,540
so this year land

361
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,290
divided by andy

362
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,640
and then of course the second one will be twice led the divided by and

363
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,500
and the third one will be three times led by the by and you will

364
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,660
again have

365
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,290
completely destructive

366
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,400
you may be interested

367
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,600
in what

368
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:33,300
magnitude is looking like intensity i should say is of this little minimax

369
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,440
well that's very easy to calculate

370
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,840
if we know that the sign of theta year is land that divided by andy

371
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,940
and we know that he would is twice that much

372
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,550
and all i have to ask the creation

373
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,930
what is your light intensity

374
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,710
when the sign of data as soon as we go to

375
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,720
the minimax

376
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,200
the first minimax

377
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,050
right here

378
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,880
so i asked equation

379
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,880
what you intensity when the sign theta

380
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,790
is now

381
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,320
one point five times land

382
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,410
divided by and the

383
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,570
then i'm

384
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,500
right in in between these two zeros

385
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,260
what i'm exactly on the maximum i don't know and they were not interested but

386
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,460
i'm sure you close

387
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,530
when sin theta is one of eleven divided by the

388
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,960
and delta

389
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,550
it's going to be three by

390
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,300
divided by n

391
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:38,880
that's easy because you take this equation one and have left over and

392
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,260
point einstein one and have learned that divided by andy to one times to become

393
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,580
i again and downstairs so you get

394
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,030
delta is three by dividing by

395
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,280
now you revisit this equation

396
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,460
and you just put in there

397
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,790
n equals four

398
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,290
you know capital and

399
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,980
none of delphi's we calculate the upstairs you calculated downstairs

400
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,560
and you will find now that i

401
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,180
it is approximately one point one seven i zero

402
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,330
that flow compared to sixteen

403
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,030
this is only some seven percent

404
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,070
six point eight percent

405
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:22,270
so this height was only seven percent of that it's very low

406
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,050
so you see now

407
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,140
these are consequences

408
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:31,240
but if you get zero by zero you get these maximized sixteen i zero

409
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,650
then you get and minus one point about you get complete zeros here but even

410
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,750
these winning maximum

411
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,710
we very much they are very low

412
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,930
in light intensity

413
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,930
and even if you go to an n of one thousand

414
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,430
and today we believe go beyond that was our experiments have capital and go up

415
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,130
to two thousand

416
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,380
if you make capital and one thousand you can we do all this

417
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,550
you'll will see that there's many maximum is roughly four and a half percent of

418
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:03,960
its maximum that maximum now becomes a million times i zero

419
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,620
if you have thousands of these openings

420
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,360
they will add up to the maximum you get a million times the intensity that

421
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,770
one alone would

422
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,710
the reason is obviously you get a thousand times the vector and they're all in

423
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,560
phase with each other and and the poynting vector is the square of the amplitude

424
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:25,550
of effect you get real

425
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,390
all these maximum

426
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,330
have the same weight

427
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,080
and if this is land that divided by and the

428
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,880
and this here on this site

429
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,370
bilayers in the plasma membrane and just allow for the passive diffusion

430
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,700
of a an iron through them through the donut hole

431
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,390
and enabling an iron

432
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,570
so if use the lipid bilayer

433
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:53,530
not trying to do things these kinds of doughnut shaped protein aggregates will allow

434
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,320
the passage of ions in one direction or another

435
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,390
and here energy is not being expanded to enable this passage it may just be

436
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,280
by through diffusion

437
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,970
but if there is a higher concentration of iron once i loved by lower one

438
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,930
on this site

439
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:13,570
this is the diffusion will allow the iron to migrate through the the bore of

440
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,050
the ion channel from one side to the other

441
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,660
in fact even though this does not involve the expenditure of expenditure of energy by

442
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,800
a part of the cell

443
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:27,780
the cell may actually use the gating mechanism to open or close these channels

444
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,550
with the tails are close to ions cannot move through

445
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:35,820
when the channels are gated open then diffusion can take over and ensure the transfer

446
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:41,070
the transportation of ions from one side to the other

447
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,570
having said that

448
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,470
we can begin to look at other higher level

449
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,530
here by the way it is a better drawing in the one i provided you

450
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,990
this is comes from your book

451
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,990
of what of what they are

452
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,640
vesicle looks like

453
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,180
here's what it looks like under the electron microscope and here's what it looks like

454
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,930
when a talented rather than hapless and hopeless artist like myself tries to draw

455
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,780
let's just say that intro into

456
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,470
lipids and membranes

457
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,090
and let's move on to the next layer of complexity

458
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:25,910
and the next layer of complexity in terms of molecules represents carbohydrates

459
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:31,510
and then we talk about carbohydrate amongst ourselves we're talking about a molecule which roughly

460
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,700
as one carbon atom for every

461
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,220
water molecule

462
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,990
and certainly indulge ourselves in talking about all kinds of different carbohydrate molecules

463
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:46,320
here is really one of the most important carbohydrate molecules glucose

464
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,320
and what should we note about glucose well the first thing you should sees the

465
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,990
glucose has six

466
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:59,030
carbon atoms and therefore as a consequence it's called a hexose

467
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:06,450
we're going to talk about pantos is very shortly they only have five to state

468
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:12,640
the obvious glycerol which we talked about before is also considered one sensor carbohydrate but

469
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,160
it's only a

470
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,570
it's been called by some people

471
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,260
a trial still only has three carbon atoms

472
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,110
and you can imagine therefore in principle

473
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,010
that there are certain biochemical mechanism which indeed exists

474
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,780
which enable the wonder join two

475
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,610
glycerol molecules one to the other to create something like a texas

476
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:39,740
in fact what we see from this drawing expertly drawn by yours truly

477
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,700
is that the hexose molecule is really a linear molecule

478
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,390
in solution

479
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:52,050
what happens is that the because of various staring and thermodynamic forces it likes to

480
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,390
cycle eyes

481
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,200
let me just mention i just use two words that are useful to know about

482
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:07,700
four stereo chemistry refers to the three-dimensional structure of the molecule and obviously the stereo

483
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:13,680
chemistry of of the molecule is dictated by the flexibility with which participating atoms can

484
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,870
form bonds

485
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:20,760
whether we have tried a vaillant adam like nitrogen or or tetravalent and like carbon

486
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,800
or model they look like hydrogen

487
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,800
and these structures the stereo chemistry is dictated

488
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,280
both by

489
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:36,610
by what i happens to present here by thermodynamic considerations which cause this particular hexose

490
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,130
indeed virtually all hexose is to

491
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,570
cycle i

492
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:45,220
when i six cycle is obvious i mean to form a circular structure

493
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,340
here we note one thing you can see how

494
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:56,280
the hydroxyl here actually attacks the positively charged carbon here in order for this cyclic

495
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,410
you see one of the six points on this

496
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:06,530
take hexagonal structure is

497
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,630
is oxygen is not is not carbon at all

498
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,260
so there's one oxygen and five carbons and one of the

499
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,640
carbon is relegated is

500
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,550
is exiled to outside of the size of the

501
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,720
this circle is sometimes called an extra cyclic

502
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,220
because it sticking out from the actual circle

503
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,840
and this is the structure where in which glucose actually exists inside cells

504
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,220
and in fact there

505
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,950
there is in truth two alternative ways by which glucose can cycle is where the

506
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,910
oxygen attacks the car the carbon on the common group underneath or on top and

507
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,300
you see that gives us

508
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,130
two alternative structures

509
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,700
what's different about them

510
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,550
well if we think about this axis is existing in the plane

511
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,240
is where the hexagon is in the plane in this case the oxygen is above

512
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,550
the plane and the hydrogen is below the plane

513
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,780
with equal probability you can have these two

514
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,870
the two atoms reverse right is now

515
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,800
above the plane and hydroxide is below the plane

516
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:20,030
in both of these structures these alternative structures can fairly be considered to be glucose

517
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,860
let's get a little bit more complicated

518
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:27,220
here we have fructose and we have galactose

519
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,970
what we see here is by the way that we have exactly the same number

520
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:38,220
of carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms oxygen atoms but they looked up slightly differently

521
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,680
and here now we began to get get very

522
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:50,200
the disposition the orientation all these different kinds of hydroxyl and hydrogen and no by

523
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,200
the way that many cases one doesn't even put in the age for the hydrogen

524
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,970
is just implied by this

525
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,720
the end of this line

526
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,430
and here we if you were to look at this you see here now we

527
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,550
have two extra cyclic carbons

528
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,200
here's galactose

529
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,970
which is yet another hexose these are all accesses but there's stereo chemistry

530
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,240
creates a quite different kinds of structures

531
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,280
and it turns out that the stereo chemistry is extremely important

532
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,010
these molecules function very differently one from the other

533
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,950
and for example to the extent that glucose is used in different kinds of energy

534
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:28,130
metabolism and to the extent of galactose is not

535
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,820
there must be certain biochemical mechanisms

536
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,030
in which one has catalysts catalysts that we call enzymes

537
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,950
that ensure that one can convert

538
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,090
one of these hexose is

539
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,360
through an enzyme

540
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:46,300
in two let's say a useful less useful ones into more useful one glucose which

541
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,160
can readily be burnt up

542
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,200
by the energy generating machinery

543
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,590
here we're gone yet another order of magnitude more complex

544
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,070
because we've gone from model satirized right i mean one or another hexose

545
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,780
two dice right and here's common table sugar

546
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,490
and here you see that it's form

547
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,910
once again through an esterification reaction

548
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,970
i e there is a dehydration reaction between

549
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,530
this hydroxyl here

550
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,280
and this hydroxyl here

551
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:22,340
and biochemist take the orientation of these hydroxyl groups very seriously

552
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,340
you can say that there a bit obsessive

553
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:30,100
attractive women with a tale of a fish as described and represented by the

554
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,700
later tradition but nasty rapacious birds

555
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,150
and there was Priaphus

556
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,870
who was considered ridiculous because of that huge member that was not

557
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:47,200
thought to be handsome and was defined as amorphous

558
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,510
without form

559
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,770
as ugly icecrown was not

560
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:59,850
he had not the correct form he was oppressed by loneliness and his incapacity to seduce

561
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:05,580
a nymph dependent of his hypertrophic possibilities

562
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,990
to the east

563
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:14,390
even tough the history of literature is full of descriptions of ugly men

564
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:21,330
there is another interesting aspect of ugliness which is the vituperation with regard

565
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,250
to women

566
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:29,980
whose ugliness reveals their inner malice and pernicious powers of seduction and that

567
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,960
was a theme that enjoyed great success

568
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:39,620
so it happens so in the classical literature Horus Catullus and Marshall

569
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:46,910
had already provided us with the repulsive portraits of women and in the early

570
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:56,150
Christian literature the problem of cosmetics scrubbed up with Tertullian who remarks with ruthless severity that

571
00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:01,990
according to the scripture the allurement of beauty are always as one with

572
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,240
the prostitution of the body

573
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:11,490
and apart from moral condemnation Tertullian is insinuating that women plastered themselves with

574
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:17,910
make up and other artifice to conceal their physical defects

575
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,170
in the middle ages there were many portrayals of the old women as symbol of

576
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:30,010
physical and moral decay and the acme of misogyny was reached in Boccaccio's Corbaccio

577
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,240
the narrator loves

578
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:40,460
are unrequited the beautiful widow and his evident resentment is expressed by the

579
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:45,780
soul of her husband that asends from purgatory to

580
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:52,340
tell the narrator about the licentiousness and the perfidy of these woman revealing

581
00:35:52,340 --> 00:36:00,180
that she conceals her fifthy years with creams and other revolting mock and dwelling at length upon

582
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:05,370
the disgusting decays of her physical ugliness

583
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:12,650
during that's Leonardo the Renaissance female ugliness became the subject of lampoons

584
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:19,170
containing ironic praise of models that didn't conform to the dominant aesthetic

585
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,670
and let me only quote

586
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:30,710
in translation obviously these nice verses of Clement Marot on two ugly tits

587
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:38,080
tit that is nothing but skin scrawny flat limply flapping big tit long tit

588
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:44,230
squashed tit tit like a bun tit with a pointy nipple like the sharp end of a funnel

589
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:50,410
you jounce about at every move without any need for a shake toasted tilt tit

590
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:56,390
hanging tit wrinkled tit tit that gives mud instead of milk the devil wants you

591
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:03,940
in its infernal family to nurse his daughter tit to be thrown over one shoulders and so

592
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:11,150
on and so forth later in the baroque period a woman's imperfection

593
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:16,410
were describe described as an element of interest

594
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,230
sometimes of a sexual stimuli

595
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:28,360
poems appeareed in praise of women who stammered or were dwarfs hunchbacks cross-eyed bock market

596
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:35,170
and in contrast to the medeival tradition of highly coloured or rosy cheeks Marino has stolen

597
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,760
the palour

598
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,370
of his beloved I want I want to

599
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:45,000
Giambattista Marino to read it first in Italian because I find it very beautiful

600
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,340
pallidetto mio sole

601
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,450
ai tuoi dolci pallori

602
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,690
perde l’alba vermiglia i suoi colori

603
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,820
pallidetta mia morte

604
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:01,860
a le tue dolci e pallide viole la porpora amorosa perde vinta la rosa

605
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,080
oh piaccia a la mia sorte

606
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,670
che dolce teco impallidisca anch’io

607
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,020
pallidetto amor mio!

608
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,910
oh one little sun of mine the bright red dove loses its corals

609
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,930
before your sweet pallor

610
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,910
oh dear palid death of mine vanquished the rose loses its red amorous

611
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,870
colour before your sweet and palid violets oh let it please destiny that I might

612
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:35,120
become as palid as you my sweet love

613
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:41,040
but probably the most grotesque celebration of the female ugliness is to be

614
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,280
found in the Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton

615
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:54,470
love is blind as the saying is cupid's blind and so are all his followers

616
00:38:54,470 --> 00:39:00,950
Quisquis amat ranam ranam putat esse Dianam every lover admires

617
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:07,620
his mistress tough she be very deformed of herself ill-favoured wrinkled pimpled pale red

618
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,150
yellow tanned tallow

619
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:16,910
tallow-faced have a swollen juggler's platter face or a thin lean chitty face have clouds in

620
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:23,430
her face be crooked dry bald goggle-eyed blear-eyed or with staring eyes

621
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:29,050
she looks like a squis'd cat hollow-eyed black or yellow about the eyes

622
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:34,730
squint-eyed, sparrow-mouthed, Persian hook-nosed, have a sharp fox nose

623
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:40,300
red nose China flat great nose a nose like a promontory

624
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:47,280
rotten teeth black uneven brown teeth beetle browed witch's beard her breath stink

625
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:54,750
all over the room her nose drop winter and summer with a Bavarian poke under her chin a sharp chin

626
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:01,800
lave eared with a long crane's neck her dugs like two double jugs or else

627
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,950
no dugs in that other extreme bloody fallen fingers she have filthy long unpared

628
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:14,950
nails scabbed hands or wrists a tanned skin a rotten carcas crooked back she stoops

629
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:20,130
is lame splay-footed as slender in the middle as a cow in the waist

630
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:20,930
so set

631
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,750
and more relevant here

632
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,290
this the convex hull

633
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,000
of rays

634
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,800
upward pointing race

635
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:34,190
in the convex hull of those of the union of those

636
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,360
i can't tell of the union of those

637
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,440
it is

638
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,610
a b epigraph

639
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:43,670
polyhedral function which in that approximates

640
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:49,170
a a a a a multiplicative function

641
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:55,650
so that's the idea of innovation approximating the epigraph by convex hulls of race

642
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,580
given a function h

643
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:02,210
and given a finite set of points we form this race

644
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,030
we take the convex hull

645
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,000
in the convex hull defined

646
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,620
upon hill function

647
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,240
was epigraph

648
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:16,780
in that approximates the epigraph of h

649
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,460
this is just terminology

650
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,390
let me just remind you also definition conjugacy

651
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:25,510
given a function f is closed lower semicontinuous

652
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:30,420
it's possible to take the epigraph and approximated by half spaces

653
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,160
corresponding to

654
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,570
and the intersection of all this approximately half spaces

655
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,100
it gives you

656
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,960
the graph of the function

657
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:47,030
and if you consider this have spaces in new parametrized by the slope

658
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,020
you get

659
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:52,900
conjugate function so by definition the conjugate functions like this given f

660
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,820
age of y

661
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,570
is a function of the slope defined like so

662
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,030
the graphical interpretation here

663
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:04,000
in the country to provide us with an alternative view of the same functions the

664
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,870
nice thing is that we have this conjugacy theorems

665
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,820
which says that the conjugate of the conjugate is the original

666
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:16,140
no information is lost by passing the conjugate you can recover the original

667
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,790
and that's all nice and

668
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,960
and the and helpful

669
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:27,960
there's also another interesting relationship which i'm going to use in my talk subgradient duality

670
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:31,720
if y is the slope of ax of

671
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:34,250
then x is the slope at y

672
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,480
o h

673
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,200
OK this an if and only if relations

674
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,260
so slow in b

675
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:45,640
correspond to points of contact in the

676
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:53,250
in in the conjugate in the inversely

677
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:57,000
and finally here's the conjugacy relation that's very important

678
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,570
suppose you have a function f

679
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:04,100
this curve function here is to have its conjugate h

680
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:09,120
suppose we make out the linearisation of f by subgradients

681
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:16,010
then the conjugate of this afternoon innovation is an intermediate station

682
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:22,890
and conversely and in the unionization of some function gives you when conjugated

683
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,070
the other linear decision will quench

684
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:30,820
furthermore you have that subgradients in the linear in other decision breakpoints in in the

685
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,740
linear position and so on

686
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,960
finally note that

687
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,050
the linear decision functions are real valued or finite

688
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:44,680
and out there in a linear decision functions are called find meaning that the conjugate

689
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:51,850
is real right

690
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,250
OK let me remind you also what the classical cutting plane method is

691
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,250
we have

692
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:02,240
we have a number of points x zero up to k

693
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,520
and the number of subgradients and we have this

694
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,630
subgradient approximation

695
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:13,370
and then we minimize success the the submarine approximation the other this other thing station

696
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,580
and then go up to the original function and pick up the slope and we

697
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,960
add this

698
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,000
two v

699
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,110
linear decision

700
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,750
and i find it so

701
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,590
as an example of iterations we're minimizing here the function f over these constraints

702
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,100
and we have let's say two points one

703
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:39,720
subgradients we minimize this we obtain this point qx x two

704
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,770
and once we have it we differentiate and we obtain the new slope and we

705
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:45,740
have the

706
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,800
playing with cutting plane to the

707
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,930
keep going into the classical cutting plane method has many many applications in large scale

708
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,730
optimisation including dancing will composition

709
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:05,070
and many others

710
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:08,360
OK now decomposition mechanism of methods

711
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,620
and not much has been done

712
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,590
with recently

713
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:16,630
like i said to be one of the original contributors

714
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,420
and i asked what has been done to measure the composition is it says nothing

715
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:26,680
has been done for the last twenty years however even though people don't work on

716
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,570
a very much it has carbon h

717
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,230
in certain types of large scale problems including

718
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:38,530
i plebeian problems that involve a huge dimension

719
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:42,490
multicommodity flow problems in there is really the method to use

720
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,600
and here's how it works

721
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,800
we minimize f

722
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,750
all the constraints that

723
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,610
and here we keep f untouched but we

724
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,640
in the linear arise the constraints

725
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,120
the incident angle

726
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,230
of fado one

727
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:02,270
some of it is reflected

728
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:05,770
this angle is also say that one as we discussed earlier

729
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:08,930
and some of it is refracted into this medium

730
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,790
this angle will call

731
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,660
theta two

732
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,410
so disliked unpolarized comes in

733
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,350
and reference

734
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,730
if you want to use maxwell's equations

735
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:26,740
at the action where everything is happening right here at the service between the two

736
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,000
you'll have to

737
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,440
decompose the incoming light

738
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:31,990
the electric field vector

739
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,750
in two

740
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,300
in one direction

741
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,990
is perpendicular to the blackboard so this is the vector

742
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,520
and the other direction

743
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,550
is in the blackboards

744
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:46,900
you have to do the same year

745
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,900
you have to do the same year

746
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,480
and if you look at this decomposition

747
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,840
and then notice

748
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:57,720
that both components this component

749
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:59,640
as well as this component

750
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,810
is perpendicular to the direction of propagation that's always must was travelling electric

751
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,250
never great you see the same year

752
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,640
this component and this both perpendicular to the reflected beam

753
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,350
this component and this both perpendicular to the it

754
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:19,640
this one

755
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,040
the one perpendicular to the blackboard

756
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,320
we normally give simple perpendicular

757
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,170
recall this the incidence playing

758
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,620
the playing field incident light and the normal to the surface we call that the

759
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,520
incident plane in this place

760
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,560
in this case it is the blackboard we call this the perpendicular component and we

761
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,670
call this the parallel component

762
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,860
and this is of course the incident beam

763
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,530
this one called the perpendicular component

764
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,970
there's one called parallel component

765
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,390
and this is now of the refractive

766
00:47:50,400 --> 00:48:02,510
this is the parallel component this is the perpendicular component of the re collective

767
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,840
the incident light

768
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,560
it's not polarized

769
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,510
in this sense

770
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,520
so if you

771
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,050
then there is no preferred direction

772
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,870
of the electric field

773
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:18,790
that means and that in this representation

774
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,290
the strength of this component

775
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,810
and the strength of this component must be exactly equal

776
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,040
because if one were stronger than the other

777
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,320
then it wouldn't be

778
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,450
unpolarized then there would be

779
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,490
on average preferred direction

780
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:38,430
so this component has the same strength is that component forty incoming light

781
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,900
well maxwell's equations now can do for us

782
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,270
so a lot of work

783
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,730
you may see the NATO three

784
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,940
it can relate

785
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,670
the parallel component in reflection

786
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,560
with the parallel component of incident

787
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,060
the parallel component of refraction

788
00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:00,140
was the parallel component of incidents give you two relations took two

789
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,240
it can also relate the perpendicular component of reflection

790
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,400
with this perpendicular component

791
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,160
and the perpendicular component in refraction

792
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,420
with this component so you get four

793
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,140
in this light that comes in is unpolarized

794
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:23,780
the strength of this component is the same as this one

795
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:28,380
in general you will see if you applied for equations that that's no longer the

796
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,280
case where there are no longer the same intensity and there are no longer the

797
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,900
same intensity here

798
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,980
that means this reflected light

799
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,140
and the refracted light has now become partially

800
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:48,020
i will only give you the relations one of those four equations

801
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,510
i will only address today

802
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:53,090
the parallel component of the incident beam

803
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:56,900
in the parallel component of the reflected

804
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,470
and i don't imagine anyone of you will try to remember that equation i don't

805
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:02,410
have to look it up every time

806
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,200
then i deal with this

807
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:09,520
so he zero it's always represents the maximum possible value of the electric field

808
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:12,390
of the parallel component

809
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,780
of the

810
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,720
the reflected beam

811
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:18,910
that's the one

812
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,840
but i'm after going to make polarized light

813
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:23,860
by reflecting

814
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,910
it is zero

815
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:27,900
the parallel component

816
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,010
of the incident beam

817
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,610
this depends now on the angle of incidence

818
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,550
and on the indices of

819
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,270
it's going to be an one

820
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,750
time the cosine

821
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,440
if theta two

822
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:45,050
miners and two

823
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,050
the cosine of theta one

824
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,820
but even after all this follows from maxwell

825
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,550
divided by n one

826
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:53,170
i'm the cosine

827
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:54,230
of the two

828
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,050
and two

829
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,280
times the cosine

830
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,610
theta one

831
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,900
and if you apply snails law

832
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,640
you can simplify this equation

833
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,880
in this case

834
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,250
it will help us

835
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,600
so you get minus

836
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,300
he zero

837
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,810
incidents and now you get get the tangent

838
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,140
of data one

839
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:20,890
you might say that two

840
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,550
divided by the tangent

841
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,890
of theta one

842
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:26,770
plus they two

843
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:30,630
these two equations are identical may not be obvious to you

844
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:35,180
certainly not obvious to me either but if you substitute

845
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:36,720
south line here

846
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,230
you can show that these two

847
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,350
i the same

848
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:46,060
keep in mind if you ever interested in the intensity of these lights

849
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,150
you must always remember

850
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,410
that the poynting vector is proportional to the zero square

851
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,740
so you always have to square these numbers when you're interested

852
00:51:54,750 --> 00:52:01,160
in light intensity this is just the strength of the vector

853
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,880
there's something very special hidden in this equation

854
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:07,150
that's when theta one

855
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,400
plus two

856
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,110
is ninety degrees

857
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:15,210
and the downstairs here is infinitely large

858
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,630
so that means

859
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:20,260
the parallel component in reflection

860
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,180
it's zero

861
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,400
so he

862
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,660
in reflection

863
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,680
goes to zero

864
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,870
and if everyone goes to zero

865
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,840
there's only this one left which is not zero

866
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:39,050
and that means the reflected light is now one percent polarized in this direction because

867
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:43,390
i have killed this component completely but it only works if this is met this

868
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,970
this condition is met that fate along

869
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,120
let's say that two is ninety degrees

870
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,560
and it follows from high school math

871
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,700
that the sign of

872
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,890
data two is then the cosine

873
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:00,370
of the the one that immediately obvious right you remember

874
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,290
the triangle

875
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,660
they want to say that was ninety degrees

876
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,320
the sign one angle

877
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,820
the cosine of the other

878
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:09,900
and if no

879
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,680
remember smells law

880
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,490
which says that the sign

881
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,260
of theta one

882
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:21,090
divided by the sine

883
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,950
of data two

884
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:25,600
if n two defined by one

885
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,790
i can replace now only for this special case the sign of

886
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:34,020
now come on the chance of that that all the copies they would mutate back

887
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:38,530
months i mean you can repeat several times and this is always what happens

888
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:42,630
what does that tell you about this mutation in the virus

889
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,130
the notion of the virus

890
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:51,330
because it always mutation it would be transmitted through

891
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:53,960
but as a constrained a

892
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:58,610
makes it loses its ability to grow on strain b

893
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,980
but as i was passing through strain b it can grow in strength

894
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,480
this is not

895
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,850
typical genetics

896
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,940
to south were a lot of this he really worked out what was going on

897
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:17,470
well so anyway they refer to this as a strain b

898
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:21,520
having the ability

899
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,950
two restrict

900
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:28,170
the growth

901
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,110
of the virus

902
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:36,770
strain b can restrict the growth of the virus

903
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:40,050
that's where this word restriction enzyme comes from

904
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:43,120
what's really truly going on here

905
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:47,440
underneath the shaggy dog story took a long time before the shaggy dog story that

906
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,100
salvatore loria was once really

907
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,520
a demonstrate

908
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:56,260
i was fully worked out but what turns out to be the case

909
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,320
is that strain b

910
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,720
a restriction enzyme that's how it restricts the growth

911
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:13,650
it has one of these enzymes that can cut DNA

912
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,460
at a specific place

913
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:20,600
when the virus comes in

914
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,370
to strain b

915
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:26,030
injected DNA

916
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,270
and the enzymes

917
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,920
comes along

918
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,350
and cuts the viruses DNA

919
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:35,550
protecting the bacteria

920
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,910
it's got its own little defense mechanism

921
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:39,630
pretty cool

922
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,350
pretty cool

923
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:46,130
so any DNA that introduced

924
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:54,720
if it has the sequence here it's a GA TTC the the better cuts

925
00:55:56,510 --> 00:56:00,150
the bacteria has its own DNA

926
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,820
what is in the shop of its own chromosome

927
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:10,370
well i mean maybe so we know what simple possibility would be that

928
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,450
if this thing is looking for the sequence GATTACA

929
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:15,950
in the genome

930
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:20,620
maybe it's the case

931
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:23,950
the bacteria has range that it's all DNA

932
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,180
never has the g eight TTC

933
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:30,290
be simple solution right

934
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:34,050
but is it plausible solution one

935
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:40,870
which is statistically how often do you expect to encounter GATTACA

936
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:45,140
what's what's the frequency of of any given six letter word in a four letter

937
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:51,080
about one in forty six

938
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:56,270
it's about one in four to the sixth positions will be GATTACA and that's about

939
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:58,550
four thousand letters

940
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:04,110
so every four thousand letters i expect to encounter GATTACA how big is the e

941
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:09,310
coli genome four million letters so how many GAT disease will there be

942
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,650
about one thousand of them

943
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,780
it's just not possible to imagine

944
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:15,780
that it doesn't have the sites

945
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:20,390
so your idea is that if it has these sites it's got arranged to protect

946
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:21,930
its own sites

947
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,820
so how's protected sites

948
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:40,240
composite or something where you could can imagine composite or something that you want you

949
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,810
want to alter your own site so it turns out you're exactly right what happens

950
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:48,870
is there is an enzyme that comes along and at this position

951
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,990
it modifies the DNA

952
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,950
modifies the DNA

953
00:57:57,090 --> 00:58:00,470
by attaching the math or

954
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:07,200
it turns out that methyl group is enough to prevent the restriction enzyme from bind

955
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:10,760
so this blocks the restriction enzyme

956
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:21,620
so that way the bacteria is able to distinguish between its own DNA which is

957
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:27,050
methylated and the viral DNA

958
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:36,130
so it so happens that explain my virus that managed to grow

959
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,930
my virus managed to grow

960
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:42,820
it would need to have gotten itself modified also be protected

961
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,810
could that happen by chance

962
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,170
what is the methylation enzyme

963
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,230
the math always

964
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,770
which is floating around in the cell

965
00:58:55,850 --> 00:59:01,600
so that we could quotes

966
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:06,210
methylated the viruses DNA

967
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:08,720
what happened then

968
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:11,560
the virus to become immune

969
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:16,120
so you so so suppose the virus bacteria is pretty clever

970
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:21,300
and i had a lot more restriction enzyme and only a little bit of is

971
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:24,850
well imagine that most of the time the restriction enzyme would cut up the viral

972
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:26,530
DNA first

973
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:28,360
but every once in awhile

974
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:30,480
the marseillaise would get there first

975
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,790
and protect the viruses DNA

976
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,450
that becomes an immune virus

977
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,370
because it can be cut by the enzyme anymore

978
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,820
and if i take that on again on strain b

979
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:46,410
it will now produce artifacts because he was mentally

980
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:50,030
and i brought again on strain b

981
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:55,410
forgot downstream it remains mentally because what misleading comes into the cell is not cut

982
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:59,020
and so its descendants will get level

983
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,460
but what happens if i ever wrote virus

984
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:07,290
now related virus strain a

985
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:12,120
strain it doesn't have the restriction enzyme and it doesn't have the math always

986
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,880
so the progeny phage to grow strain a

987
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:18,220
we are now fully

988
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,210
there are no longer protected

989
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:25,890
the protection that the virus has is the protection that comes from this methylation enzyme

990
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,060
it's not the sequence of DNA

991
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:32,060
it's the attachment of methyl groups and so it turns out that if you ever

992
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:35,240
pass this virus through strain a

993
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:38,130
passage through strain a

994
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,470
the resulting DNA

995
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,620
is on mandolin

996
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:51,160
and now

997
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,110
it can be cut

998
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:57,130
and it can be cut

999
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:02,790
well this explain the weird results of glory

1000
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:05,510
that somehow bacteria

1001
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:11,060
had a complex defense mechanism of the restriction enzyme and cognate monopolies

1002
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,650
the restriction enzyme would cut the sequence chromosome would be protected by manipulating that site

1003
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:21,200
and usually works fine occasionally of bacterial virus would get methylated it would be protected

1004
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,620
as long as it continues to go through strains that have this restriction appellation system

1005
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:31,170
that was now the shaggy dog story took a couple of decades to work out

1006
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:36,570
and eventually led to the nobel prizes for the discovery of restriction enzymes there extremely

1007
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:38,490
important because

1008
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:43,590
although bacteria do this to protect themselves they have also given us the perfect tool

1009
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,460
to now

1010
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:48,540
with the same equation we started with

1011
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,960
what is the point

1012
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:55,400
the point of having done all this was because now

1013
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:58,400
the left hand side is

1014
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:04,240
exactly the derivative of something and the left hand side is should be the derivative

1015
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:11,050
of well it should be the derivative of one plus cosine x times y all

1016
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:21,500
now projected that in fact the case is 1 was cosine x y prime plus

1017
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:25,160
minus sign x the derivative of this flight times Y.

1018
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:32,700
if you have a lot in looking at the equation to save yourself this is

1019
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:36,990
the derivative of that maybe I'll just check right away to see if it's the

1020
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:41,430
derivative of one plus cosine x i know you would have say that on

1021
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:47,660
well you know that gradient of clever anything like that you do it

1022
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:52,800
you can follow your nose and it's just I want to give you a positive

1023
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:59,700
experience in solving linear equations not to negative anyway so we got to this point

1024
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:04,510
so this is to actually now we're ready to solve the equation which is of

1025
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:12,950
the solution now will be 1 plus cosine X times Y is equal to x

1026
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:18,200
squared plus the constant and so why is equal to

1027
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:26,320
x squared divided by the x squared plus the constant divided by 1 plus cosine

1028
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:34,640
X I suppose I'm giving you initial to an initial condition which I didn't but

1029
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:40,720
I suppose the initial conditions so that y 0 1 where 1 for instance then

1030
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:45,920
the solution would be so this therefore I'm throwing it at the end just to

1031
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,340
make it a little bit more a problem how I put then I can evaluate

1032
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:55,500
the constant or by using the initial condition what would it be this would be

1033
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:59,720
on the left hand side 1 on the right hand side would be C over

1034
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:04,970
2 so I would get 1 equals C over 2 is that correct cosine of

1035
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:08,460
0 is 1 so that the down below therefore

1036
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:14,840
C is equal to 2 and that would wouldn't complete solution will be x squared

1037
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:32,950
plus 2 over 1 plus cosine x now let's see what you can do this

1038
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:39,430
in general of course get a general formula and of occasion to use that next

1039
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:45,650
week but for now why don't we concentrate on the most interesting case namely that

1040
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:50,900
of the linear equation with constant coefficients that is so let's look at the linear

1041
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:56,450
equation with constant coefficients because that's the 1 that most closely models the conduction and

1042
01:04:56,450 --> 01:05:14,380
diffusion equations so I'm interested in instances of the problem all probably its most of

1043
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:19,300
the most important case is the 1 where P is a constant because of its

1044
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:23,570
applications that and many of the other the bank account for example all of those

1045
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:28,060
would use a constant coefficient so but how is the thing I don't work well

1046
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,910
I'll use the

1047
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:36,340
cooling let's let's use the temperature model for example the generative model the equation will

1048
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,860
be the

1049
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:47,650
is equal to now notice on the right hand side is the common error but

1050
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:54,900
you don't put t you have to put KATE because that's what says you if

1051
01:05:54,900 --> 01:06:00,110
you think you you won't have any trouble units have to be compatible on both

1052
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:05,030
sides of the differential equation and therefore whatever the units were for capital k t

1053
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:10,570
I have the same units on the right hand side which indicates I cannot have

1054
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:15,740
T on the left of the differential equation and just T on the right and

1055
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:20,740
extract the units to be compatible with that's not possible so that's a good way

1056
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:23,840
so now first of all let me show you that for baseline

1057
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:27,240
if you estimate the parameters of the time

1058
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:30,340
you see that as you would expect to alpha that you get is actually pretty

1059
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:34,590
close to zero is very concentrated around which is reassuring

1060
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:39,930
if indicates that we know that there should be a social influence subsequent that says

1061
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,130
that the thing

1062
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:44,840
for the

1063
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:47,280
influence models

1064
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:53,880
so this is the data generated using the influence model the variety of of parameters

1065
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,630
they're all for the estimate

1066
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:01,200
and all for the estimate after which shuffle the time spent as you can see

1067
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,570
here in this graph are very different so there cost this here

1068
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:12,130
estimated of us after the first of all the dots are estimated from before the

1069
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:17,420
and as you see there are many different so there is no significant difference at

1070
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:21,570
the shuttle and this is also the distribution so if you look we're all we're

1071
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:22,380
all the

1072
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:23,510
the fact that he

1073
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:26,590
new simulation and the distribution is going to be very

1074
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:32,380
which is also reassuring saying that the influence the data that we actually

1075
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:35,680
generated using one

1076
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:39,380
if you're on this test actually is going to

1077
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,900
decided influences like factor

1078
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:46,700
for correlation model also

1079
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:50,240
it has to be working very well again this is essentially the same

1080
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:57,530
we crosses corresponding to reshuffle of after shuffling about corresponding to

1081
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:59,200
alpha before sampling

1082
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:03,420
and as you see that they are very close to each other in fact crossed

1083
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:06,010
and to a slightly higher

1084
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:08,320
and the distributions are also very close to each other

1085
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,260
so that's basically saying that essentially that's it

1086
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:17,050
confirmation of the theoretical justification that if you do the reshuffling the estimate that you

1087
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:21,900
get is not to be very different from those original

1088
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:25,320
and finally this is the data for their

1089
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,860
in influence model again

1090
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:34,320
you all you have reverse the direction of all edges remembered that there are something

1091
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:38,320
like twenty eight percent of the edges are directed to neutral

1092
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:42,380
the reverse the direction of all edges and re estimate alpha

1093
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,610
in the new graph

1094
01:08:43,630 --> 01:08:49,280
and again you see the estimates that we get a much lower than the original

1095
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,070
and that's also

1096
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:56,430
so that's a civil defense we don't have many theoretical justification but this is actually

1097
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,530
one of the tests that are used in the

1098
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:03,550
and that's confirming the fact that this is going to

1099
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:07,150
this is essentially showing that there is this model that you know

1100
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,820
actually generated based on

1101
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:15,030
and this is not the distribution of the

1102
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:20,800
same thing for the correlation model here i'm shown in different graph

1103
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:23,880
this is the of estimator of a

1104
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:28,930
when the edges are this is that many of islanders on not and

1105
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:33,240
things are very close to their why complex life is that

1106
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:36,780
after after the edge so that's not

1107
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:40,380
and the distributions are also very close

1108
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:48,380
the result of the happened

1109
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:51,780
know that for data so really tagging data

1110
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:56,180
and they said that they wanted to observed that there is considerable social correlation so

1111
01:09:56,180 --> 01:10:00,710
if you measured itself parameter and make your data you see that of something between

1112
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:03,160
one and two was significant

1113
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:04,470
but in fact

1114
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:07,340
when you run this shuffle we see that

1115
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:11,950
you get something that's very very close to the wire that's life so alpha estimate

1116
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:15,510
is not going to change very much if you just reshuffled

1117
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:20,420
time stamp of all actions and the distribution there is essentially remained the same as

1118
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:24,430
well so that's that's an indication that even though we have

1119
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:29,400
considerable social relations in this talk this not from employers

1120
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:34,430
and in fact likely to achieve result of also indicating the same so if you

1121
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:38,400
reverse the direction of all edges again you're going to get this semester of

1122
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:39,740
and knowledge

1123
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:43,180
the distribution of almost the same

1124
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,860
what we did here

1125
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:52,510
was that we defined two models or correlation

1126
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:55,070
one of the social correlation one

1127
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:58,780
i had an element of social influence and one did not have the element of

1128
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:00,180
social influence

1129
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:03,720
the objective was to tell the difference between these two two models

1130
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,700
and developed statistical tests to distinguish between the two

1131
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:13,050
for one of the tests we had theoretical justification showing that

1132
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:16,300
if you're on the test and one of the two models actually is going to

1133
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:17,760
say that this is not

1134
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:23,090
and also we dont simulation football has

1135
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:30,300
four large number of data generated randomly and simulations are also suggesting that this walking

1136
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:34,930
and then there on the test on flickr data set and the conclusion was that

1137
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,400
despite the fact that we see considerable correlation

1138
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:45,010
this correlation cannot be attributed to social influence and that's an important conclusion because usually

1139
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:48,720
what you see in the papers that explicitly or implicitly

1140
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:49,630
one day

1141
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:54,490
draw the graphs and they show that there is some level of correlation

1142
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:59,970
what they conclude is that people are influencing each other and with this thing is

1143
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:03,760
that this is not necessarily the case could be that because

1144
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:10,900
because if you're on the outside valuable that were not observed these correlation

1145
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,130
but i can't

1146
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:18,730
on the twenty first of august right ten kilograms per hectare

1147
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:19,910
take bait

1148
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:24,900
there's the b then xpj what if

1149
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:26,980
what i received

1150
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,790
didn't see that treatment xpj will be zero so just an indication binary flag to

1151
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:36,670
treatment that we get

1152
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:40,910
and so we can say that's his part one part two part three part four

1153
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:41,970
part five

1154
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:46,400
in that case the five will be one

1155
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:48,500
XP sixty one e

1156
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:55,780
seventy one sixty eight people all the expertise so xp twenty seven what you want

1157
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,160
somewhere down here

1158
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:00,160
and in getting there

1159
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,260
to some extent

1160
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:07,930
because that's just crucial to what we're doing here so the fact that can use

1161
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:10,460
that encoding

1162
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:14,730
the same thing with the treatment

1163
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:16,790
so that's

1164
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,790
by an indicator for whether or not

1165
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,480
true but what has treatments a and so on but that's all industry so

1166
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,480
measures the things we can do is about things that we can control the about

1167
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,150
the treatment we apply

1168
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:34,210
it is about the block so

1169
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,910
beta two

1170
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,600
x two j

1171
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:39,130
it is that

1172
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:41,890
two j is

1173
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:47,390
one if we want to worry about a piece of land two

1174
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,400
if we plot jason that this one

1175
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:54,150
some examples

1176
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,270
so for example

1177
01:13:56,300 --> 01:14:00,830
here's what to put to is in what to so we have one for that

1178
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,580
one but not freezing block three

1179
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:06,220
so don't want to have a set

1180
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:15,800
when you look at this system so has always has the at the sun city

1181
01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:19,810
and so we normal variation as before

1182
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,490
when you look at this that

1183
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:27,160
of the financial to think that you need

1184
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:31,960
a b to a and b to one but what you actually do think of

1185
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,620
beta zero is the baseline for

1186
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:41,140
if quite the first treatment treatment i

1187
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,150
so that's

1188
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:48,540
what we think of as a baseline observations here

1189
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:51,040
what want

1190
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,410
that's what we expect to get there

1191
01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:00,740
is a baseline that compared to other cities so there's adjustments relative to this

1192
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,020
what's that

1193
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,420
to what we would find out what the model so should get out of that

1194
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:06,740
particular plot

1195
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:15,230
we have to specify the model we have too many parameters without estimating because you

1196
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:20,050
can just change one and changes to compensate

1197
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:24,520
so if we go

1198
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:26,200
with the model

1199
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:29,040
and what what's

1200
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:36,060
and that's fine because this is the key issue here though is

1201
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:42,010
does a change in treatment who different treatments does it make a difference to the

1202
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:46,480
and looking at the table is fairly obvious that does so that we want to

1203
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:52,170
know will specifically how does it very well dressed up like questions the global question

1204
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:55,670
because changing to produce attention to yield

1205
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:58,820
the point about this is this

1206
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:01,600
it didn't make it to make a difference

1207
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:03,610
changing the treatments then

1208
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:07,260
all beaches can be zero

1209
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:08,880
so this is zero

1210
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:11,390
that will be saying

1211
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,890
it doesn't make any difference

1212
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:17,450
which treatment applied to the plot

1213
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:20,210
the average is what is an average of this

1214
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:22,450
give enough detail

1215
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:25,570
it's useful to have the average velocity

1216
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:28,840
it is useful to have the average acceleration

1217
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,280
which you can find by

1218
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,860
it similar differences

1219
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,280
but before you even do that

1220
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,090
i want to define for you

1221
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:38,740
an important concept

1222
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,860
which is the velocity

1223
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:43,450
at a given time

1224
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:44,890
so this is the

1225
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:49,020
the central idea of calculus i'm hoping that if you learn calculus

1226
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:54,990
you learn about derivatives and so on by looking at x

1227
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,260
so i will remind you again this is not a course in calculus i don't

1228
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:00,190
have to do with many details

1229
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:02,020
i would rather famous picture

1230
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,370
of some particle moving

1231
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:06,860
and it's here at time t

1232
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:09,550
at some value of x

1233
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:11,180
a little later

1234
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,650
but this time t plus delta t

1235
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:17,750
the devotees understand always what is small

1236
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:19,310
an interval of time

1237
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,920
infinitesimal interval of time market zero

1238
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:26,330
during that time the particles gone from here

1239
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:30,540
that is explicit delta x

1240
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:33,440
and the average velocity in that interval

1241
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,250
is delta x

1242
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:37,980
he invented the the graphically

1243
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,690
this guy is delta x

1244
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,670
this guy is delta t

1245
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:48,710
delta x o delta t is the ratio

1246
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:51,080
so in countless what you want to do

1247
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:54,630
is to get the notion of the velocity right now

1248
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:59,540
we all have intuitive notion of velocity right now any driving in your car

1249
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:03,980
immediately uses sixty that have lost velocity at the

1250
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,690
it's very interesting because velocity seems to require

1251
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:10,020
two different times to define it

1252
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,880
initial time in the final time

1253
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:14,630
and yet you want to talk with the velocity right now

1254
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:18,580
is the whole triumph of countless is not that by looking at the

1255
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,080
position now

1256
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,230
the position slightly later

1257
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:23,980
take the ratio

1258
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:28,440
and bringing later as close as possible right now we define quantity

1259
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,940
that we can say is the velocity at distance

1260
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:35,580
so b of t

1261
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:39,670
it is the limit

1262
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:41,040
delta t

1263
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:42,420
because zero

1264
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,770
delta x o delta t

1265
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:47,860
and we use the symbol

1266
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,190
sixty four

1267
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:56,440
so technically if you ask what is the velocity stand for

1268
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,960
it stands for

1269
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:00,500
let me drop

1270
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,040
general situations

1271
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:05,630
the article goes from here to to here

1272
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:07,480
the vector delta t

1273
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,980
and how well you can see in this figure here

1274
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:13,310
is the slope of of the straight line connecting these two points

1275
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:18,960
and that's the points come closer and closer straight line will become had to occur

1276
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:22,480
well as the have any part of the curve is handed to the curve

1277
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,480
the point

1278
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,380
the standard of the data this angle

1279
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:27,730
if they

1280
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:35,310
then delta xn where delta t by trigonometry stand data

1281
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:39,690
OK once you can take one derivatives you can take any number derivatives and the

1282
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,310
of the velocity

1283
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:45,250
it's called the acceleration

1284
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:48,150
and we write it as the second derivative

1285
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:55,190
i'm hoping you guys are comfortable with the notion of taking one or two

1286
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:57,420
a number of

1287
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:02,360
the only the first two derivatives happening

1288
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:04,830
this was the last the second was is acceleration

1289
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:10,500
i was never given a name

1290
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:13,270
and i don't know why i think the main reason is that there are no

1291
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:16,170
equations that involve the derivative

1292
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:20,900
because i a is this fellow here

1293
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,170
and nothing else

1294
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:23,790
is given an independently

1295
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,480
course you can take a function that take derivatives

1296
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:29,100
any number of times

1297
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:31,460
so you're supposed to know

1298
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,580
for example if x of t

1299
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,310
is due to the end

1300
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,920
you're supposed to know

1301
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:43,920
and to the u n minus one

1302
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:49,500
it was no derivatives of simple functions like science and course

1303
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,190
if you don't know that then

1304
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:53,650
course you have to work harder than other people

1305
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:54,860
you know that

1306
01:20:54,980 --> 01:21:01,020
that may be enough for quite some time

1307
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,000
OK so

1308
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:04,080
what i have said so far is

1309
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:06,860
moving in time

1310
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:08,540
from point to point

1311
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:11,730
can be represented by a graph expresses t

1312
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:15,420
any point on the ground you can take the derivative which will be handed to

1313
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:16,540
the kernel

1314
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,560
at each point

1315
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:22,810
and numerical value will be what you can call the instantaneous velocity at that point

1316
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:24,980
and you can take the derivative of the evidence

1317
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,790
and call it the acceleration

1318
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:30,650
so we going to specialize

1319
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:31,860
two of the

1320
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,330
the limit the class of problems

1321
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:36,880
in the rest of this class

1322
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,770
limited class of problems

1323
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:40,330
is one in which

1324
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,900
the acceleration

1325
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:51,170
it is just a constant

1326
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:52,310
that not

1327
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:56,170
most general thing but i sure you guys have some idea why get interested in

1328
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:59,310
that anybody know why that's too big

1329
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:02,210
so much time is spent on that yes

1330
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:05,230
but mean

1331
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:10,230
the most famous example is when things fall on the surface of the earth

1332
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:12,790
we all have the same acceleration

1333
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:16,130
and the acceleration that's most common

1334
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:17,690
it's called g

1335
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:19,440
the main point eight

1336
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:20,960
i mean per

1337
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:24,330
second square

1338
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,400
so that's a very difficult problem

1339
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:31,150
following the surface of the earth you're describing the problem constant acceleration that's why there's

1340
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:32,790
a lot of emphasis on

1341
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:37,670
sharpening your feet by doing this class problem

1342
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:40,250
the question we can ask is the following

1343
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,880
if i tell you

1344
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:45,060
the article is a constant acceleration

1345
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,630
can you tell me

1346
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:52,460
what the position x is

1347
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:56,290
normally i would give you function and tell you to take any number derivative activities

1348
01:22:56,290 --> 01:22:58,400
this is the backwards problem

1349
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,650
you're you're only given the particle is acceleration a

1350
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,330
and you asked to find out

1351
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:06,210
what is six

1352
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:07,610
what's your job

1353
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:08,440
is too

1354
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:10,860
if function

1355
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,440
well second derivative

1356
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,360
is it

1357
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,290
and this is called

1358
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:20,170
integration with the opposite differenciation

1359
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:23,650
integration is just guessing

1360
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:28,420
integration is not in algorithm that process like differences i like to be a function

1361
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,860
you know how to take the derivative change the independent variable

1362
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:35,270
by the change in the function take the ratio and that's the of

1363
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:37,150
the opposite is being asked here

1364
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:40,210
i tell you something about the second derivative of a function

1365
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:42,540
and ask you what is the function

1366
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:45,020
the way we do that is we guess

1367
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,960
and the guessing has been going on for

1368
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,960
three hundred years so we sort of know how to guess

1369
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:53,730
so let me think aloud and ask however guess in this problem

1370
01:23:53,790 --> 01:23:56,830
i would say OK this guy wants me to find the function

1371
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:58,170
all the theta

1372
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:02,170
of the negative log of p of

1373
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:06,950
next parameterized by theta

1374
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:08,360
as to vanish

1375
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:10,480
from this it follows

1376
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:11,630
i get that

1377
01:24:11,650 --> 01:24:15,230
by the way i need to correct myself on

1378
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:18,610
two things that i said ronnie before

1379
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,960
so one was regarding a convex function

1380
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:24,540
that obviously

1381
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,670
it there is no guarantee

1382
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:31,750
that the minimum value is actually attained on the context the main of a convex

1383
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:34,090
function simple example would be

1384
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:39,100
if i have got a convex function one breaks exist in the domain between

1385
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:43,050
it is in the main between one infinity so in that case a function is

1386
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:48,170
convex they will be in the form and exists there's no local minimum but i

1387
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:50,190
have no guarantee that the

1388
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,490
many of the

1389
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,800
the thing is actually minimum

1390
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:08,440
you know that

1391
01:25:19,220 --> 01:25:26,590
that's the one thing thing is that the cumulants of the moment generating function

1392
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:31,130
somebody asked whether they're just related by taking digs

1393
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:34,750
eight or eight to one of those functions to get the other one well that's

1394
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,210
not quite

1395
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:38,190
two other but

1396
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:42,280
that's said well the cumulant generating function is actually give is actually the log partition

1397
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:48,050
so if you wanted to get a cumulant generating function

1398
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,570
too quickly

1399
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:51,850
review this

1400
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:53,060
the notion of

1401
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:54,940
generating function theory

1402
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,420
what you would have is

1403
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,910
in g

1404
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,090
of data

1405
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:04,880
just defined as the integral

1406
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,000
p of x

1407
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,180
and to

1408
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:13,230
i x with theta

1409
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:19,150
just i can define some function like so

1410
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:20,890
and then

1411
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:22,470
d theta

1412
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:29,650
at the location theta equals zero

1413
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:30,760
it is

1414
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:32,540
the expected value

1415
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,880
of all things

1416
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:38,380
and the way you could see this quite easily

1417
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:40,460
that well

1418
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:48,050
of data that expression is the expected value of so to say

1419
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:52,410
o point to in but that has to be taken with a grain of salt

1420
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:56,430
because if this survey then you just get the teens of in order to can

1421
01:26:56,430 --> 01:27:01,780
be rather big beast where you can see this by looking at the tel expansion

1422
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:06,040
of of the exponential which is of course nothing else but

1423
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:08,900
well five x

1424
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:10,460
course data

1425
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,150
two in

1426
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,490
however in factorial

1427
01:27:14,510 --> 01:27:19,290
in going from zero to infinity so therefore if we

1428
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:21,280
look at this expression here

1429
01:27:21,290 --> 01:27:23,230
four theta equals zero

1430
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,230
it's the are

1431
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,260
and the only time that will survive

1432
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,680
it is exactly

1433
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:31,290
well for fixed to the and so to say

1434
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:39,080
yes sorry not quite transparent here so

1435
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:41,290
with this expression here

1436
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,430
all the terms

1437
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:44,910
four which

1438
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:49,560
i'm taking more derivatives do not having the exponent here that will vanish before the

1439
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:50,950
terms were

1440
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,940
n is greater than

1441
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:58,180
one of my derivatives well i will still have any theta occurring here so if

1442
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:01,720
i evaluated at the tate forcier it will vanish and the only time that will

1443
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:05,360
survive exactly that moment

1444
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:11,280
you can try and identify distributions matching the moments

1445
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:14,190
it's actually quite the popular thing to do

1446
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:20,620
there are probably considerably more elegant ways i can identify distribution and if you want

1447
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:25,760
to know more about how otherwise to identify sufficient talk to me about art

1448
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:31,730
tossing a dice so we had this issue

1449
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:33,590
now before

1450
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:36,230
i will go in lead you down

1451
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:42,600
say the garden path of maximum mass repostory estimation let's have a quick look at

1452
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:47,820
why and under which conditions actually maximum likelihood estimation

1453
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:51,020
can be a good thing to do

1454
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:56,010
so for that well let's first look at the fisher score

1455
01:28:56,020 --> 01:29:01,050
the fisher score b c suffix is defined as the log so there are two

1456
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:05,220
of the log p of express trusts by theta

1457
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:09,420
so now the voice words this tells us the influence of the observation x on

1458
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:13,460
estimating the parameters theta

1459
01:29:15,070 --> 01:29:21,890
and well obviously the expected value of this quantity vanishes

1460
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:26,070
because the expected value of this

1461
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:33,850
all p fixed produced by theta d theta of low p of theta

1462
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:38,210
now after will be the answer right arrangement it's the theta

1463
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:40,660
that expression here

1464
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:46,560
and this takes into is always one so the spanish

1465
01:29:46,610 --> 01:29:47,990
quite like magic

1466
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,370
but actually makes a lot of sense because if

1467
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:53,750
you know why

1468
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:59,380
you know the doctor such that it would favour a slightly different value of theta

1469
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:03,290
world and they would have chosen that other value of theta anyway

1470
01:30:03,290 --> 01:30:09,420
so you have machine readable descriptions about functionality

1471
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:11,500
the semantic web services basically

1472
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:13,260
the application of

1473
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:15,750
semantic web technologies

1474
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:21,070
based on ontologies applying these to web services components with the aim of trying to

1475
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:28,120
all the tasks associated with creating an application from the various components

1476
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:31,680
through reuse

1477
01:30:31,730 --> 01:30:36,250
now if you look at the research of various groups

1478
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:42,380
doing work on semantic web services and they talk about the semantic web service broker

1479
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:45,920
and in fact you've been doing some work on standardizing the architecture of this type

1480
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,000
of broker in oasis

1481
01:30:48,010 --> 01:30:51,520
and if you remember in the one of the earlier slide i showed where i

1482
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:56,770
talked about the roles in the web services you have the consumer and the provider

1483
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:59,310
these are the two main roles so

1484
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:03,120
if you have a semantic basis for this than you imagine that you have a

1485
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:07,540
client and the client has a set of desires or intentions so here's the client

1486
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:09,270
imagine they want to book a holiday

1487
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:12,890
and the client want to express this in terms so the color

1488
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,380
and temperature of the sea

1489
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:16,750
the colour and the temperature of the sky

1490
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:20,150
the colour of the sand the number of people on the beach vegetation

1491
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:25,120
a semantic broker if it had the right descriptions

1492
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:27,060
transform these two the

1493
01:31:27,070 --> 01:31:33,590
the area services to automatically find the appropriate services composed mediate if there are any

1494
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,450
and in fact

1495
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:40,690
so here we might imagine putting together web services for long-range weather forecasts

1496
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:44,670
web services web services for looking up and booking flights

1497
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:50,230
web services looking up and booking hotels

1498
01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:51,830
OK possible today

1499
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:04,380
she told the truth

1500
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:27,380
OK now uses of it's OK like coming through out there

1501
01:32:27,390 --> 01:32:29,810
it sounds like it

1502
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:37,080
so i'm going to talk primarily about l so alpha services

1503
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:44,230
before i go into the that wanted to extend slowly overview of this area of

1504
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:48,500
research just to mention that there are a lot of

1505
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:54,190
big challenges in this area and it very active research area and there's a lot

1506
01:32:54,190 --> 01:33:00,250
of presentations here this week this week the slide a few minutes that shows some

1507
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:03,830
of the activities later this week related to semantic web services

1508
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,380
anyway i think probably the

1509
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:10,550
the the core of the work that's been done today is probably in the first

1510
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:18,450
three top-level bullets having to do with developing a language for describing services

1511
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:22,130
in a much richer way than what you can do with commercial standards such as

1512
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:26,840
was don't say you want describe the preconditions and effects of services you may want

1513
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:31,940
to talk you may want to declare different kinds of policies related to how the

1514
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:37,890
service can be used commitments that are implied by offering a service or by using

1515
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:43,540
a service and reasoning about when those commitments might be fulfilled a lot of a

1516
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:49,040
lot of different challenges related to the clearing and reasoning about the quality of service

1517
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:55,690
or in other words issues such as response time and reliability of services

1518
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:57,060
during execution

1519
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:00,460
probably the most work in terms of

1520
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:08,680
logarithms has gone into discovery and selection of services which of course

1521
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:15,870
the commercial web services primarily done by human intelligence but the objective is my web

1522
01:34:15,870 --> 01:34:23,030
services is to automate that its fullest possible and composition of web services and the

1523
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:28,940
other area which has received the most attention to date mention also

1524
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:37,390
adaptation of workflow choreography there's a series of workshops on semantic web services challenge were

1525
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:41,120
that was one of the core problems has to do with adaptation

1526
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:46,640
of an existing workflow which may have been designed by humans but may need to

1527
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:51,330
adapt to changes in the environment and the focus there is to make is quick

1528
01:34:51,330 --> 01:34:57,420
and easy and as automatic as possible to enable that adaptation so anyway as you

1529
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:58,940
can see there are many other

1530
01:34:59,690 --> 01:35:04,180
important interesting challenges in this space of work

1531
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:07,030
so just go very briefly through

1532
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:14,900
the content of OWL s OWL an ontology expressed in OWL DL

1533
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:18,300
man draws on many

1534
01:35:18,310 --> 01:35:20,680
previous bodies of work

1535
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,330
as you can see here

1536
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:30,700
it takes advantage of the language layers that you've heard about earlier today was this

1537
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:33,110
it's expressed primarily in l

1538
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:40,030
but it also allows for the use of this world to express things like preconditions

1539
01:35:40,030 --> 01:35:49,400
and effects in particular we you may want additional or different style of expressiveness and

1540
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:53,850
so that's also about that so i breaks into three

1541
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:55,720
parts of form

1542
01:35:55,730 --> 01:36:01,420
declarative descriptions so as the profile

1543
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:02,800
we can not shell

1544
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:08,360
it is really describe what the service does there's this service model or process model

1545
01:36:08,370 --> 01:36:15,870
you describe how the service works and from the centre-right there's the grounding we describe

1546
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:21,110
how to actually access and communicate and interact operate with the service so i just

1547
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:25,560
say a few words about each of those of necessity is going to be very

1548
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:29,540
now at this point in time extremely controversial

1549
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:36,070
there's a lot of well known criticisms and attacks on freud as it is actually

1550
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:37,260
an excellent book

1551
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:40,750
on the memory works by frederick crews

1552
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:46,740
which in frederick crews is one of the strongest and most passionate critics of freud

1553
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:50,140
the problem of freud

1554
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:53,560
go like this

1555
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:56,480
there are two ways you can reject the theory

1556
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:59,260
there are two problems with the scientific theory

1557
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:04,520
one way you can reject the theory is that i could be wrong

1558
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:09,170
so suppose i have a theory that the reason why some children have autism

1559
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:13,840
a profound developmental disorder is because their mothers don't love them and

1560
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:16,750
the popular theory for many years

1561
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:21,710
possible theory it just turns out to be wrong

1562
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:25,940
but another way and so one way to attack and addresses scientific theory

1563
01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:31,940
is to view it as just to see whether or not it works

1564
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:34,960
but there is a different problem theory could have

1565
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:37,670
a theory could be sold they

1566
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:39,710
and all encompassing

1567
01:37:39,730 --> 01:37:43,730
that that it can even be tested

1568
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:46,710
and this is one of the main critics of freud

1569
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:53,070
the idea could be summed up by a quotation from the physicist wolfgang pauli and

1570
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:59,420
polly was asked his opinion about another physicist and polly said this

1571
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,820
bad guys work crap

1572
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:03,320
he's not right

1573
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:05,880
he's not even wrong

1574
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,210
and the criticism about fridays

1575
01:38:08,230 --> 01:38:10,130
is that he's not even wrong

1576
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:13,210
the issue of vagueness

1577
01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:15,590
it is summarized in the more technical way

1578
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:18,210
by the philosopher karl popper

1579
01:38:18,230 --> 01:38:19,530
who describe

1580
01:38:19,550 --> 01:38:24,380
who introduced the term of falsifiability

1581
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,760
the idea of falsifiability

1582
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:31,590
is that what distinguishes science

1583
01:38:31,610 --> 01:38:33,550
from non-science

1584
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:35,590
is the scientific predictions

1585
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,940
make strong claims about the world

1586
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:42,440
and these claims are of the sort that they could be proven wrong

1587
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:46,880
if they couldn't be proven wrong they're not interesting enough to be science so for

1588
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:52,210
example in psychology the sort of claims will be entertaining throughout the course include claims

1589
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:57,820
damage to the him the hippocampus causes failures of certain sorts of memory

1590
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:03,650
or everywhere in the world men on average one have more sexual partners than women

1591
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:09,050
or exposure to violent television tends to make children themselves more violent

1592
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:13,420
are the two other possible we'll talk about that

1593
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:14,820
but the point here is

1594
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,480
they can be falls they're interesting and i

1595
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:21,460
that they can be tested

1596
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:24,360
and as such a big literally might be wrong

1597
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:26,210
but they graduate level

1598
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:28,050
of the scientific theory

1599
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:33,260
this should be contrasted with non scientific programs and the best example of a non

1600
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:40,570
scientific program is astrology sort of problem structure of astrological predictions

1601
01:39:40,630 --> 01:39:42,840
isn't that they're wrong

1602
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:46,030
is that they can be wrong or not even when i did when i got

1603
01:39:46,030 --> 01:39:48,670
my horoscope for today

1604
01:39:48,710 --> 01:39:50,670
on the web

1605
01:39:50,690 --> 01:39:55,860
a couple of negative aspects could make it a little finicky for next few days

1606
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:58,190
ago coming watch for that

1607
01:39:58,190 --> 01:40:01,320
the presence of both mars and venus just you want to box everything in the

1608
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:06,210
ordered that structured way but keeping a piece of jade are commonly enclosed will help

1609
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:08,670
you keep in touch with your fun side

1610
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:12,150
and starting this morning about my wife will be something i can sort of in

1611
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:13,820
touch with my side

1612
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:18,210
the problem is a few days i'm going to go back to that was wrong

1613
01:40:18,230 --> 01:40:21,440
it can be wrong so it's just so think

1614
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:24,610
i got better horoscope from the onion actually

1615
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:31,250
right now the golf are not common and we have a way to police officers

1616
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:34,860
after that of the character was that the murder

1617
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:39,880
that's that's a good prediction

1618
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,980
well it turns out to be true

1619
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:47,250
i'm going to say those guys really know something

1620
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:49,710
it's falsifiable

1621
01:40:51,070 --> 01:40:53,420
arguably freud

1622
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,360
because freudian

1623
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:58,650
the theory is often so

1624
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:00,320
very inflexible

1625
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:04,690
that it can really be tested in any reliable way a big problem with this

1626
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:09,320
is a lot of freudian theories claim be validated in the course of psychoanalysis

1627
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:12,900
so when you ask people what you believe in prior they want say oh because

1628
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:17,510
of this experiment that experiment this status and that dataset was a is it's friday

1629
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:21,230
the fourteenth theory proves itself in the course of psychoanalysis

1630
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,530
the success of psychoanalysis

1631
01:41:23,570 --> 01:41:28,550
but it's unreliable i mean the problem is freud says patient you mother

1632
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:29,820
is why

1633
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,280
that makes sense

1634
01:41:32,550 --> 01:41:34,300
i right

1635
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:37,150
for the UAE mother this

1636
01:41:37,170 --> 01:41:39,070
not always to discussing

1637
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:40,300
fred says

1638
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:44,880
your anger shows his ideas painful pretty impressive and i am right

1639
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:48,210
the problem is

1640
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:51,030
the same sort of dynamic

1641
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:53,860
plays itself out even in the scientific

1642
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:55,650
the baby back and forth

1643
01:41:55,650 --> 01:42:01,490
so freud freudian psychologists putting for you what i mean is well known for his

1644
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:03,880
work will make some claims like you know

1645
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:09,300
adult personality traits are shaped by the course of psychosexual development all dreams disguise wish-fulfilment

1646
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:15,150
psychoanalysis the best treatment for mental disorders scientists respond i disagree therefore no evidence supporting

1647
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:17,420
those claims and fraud in responses

1648
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:22,030
the rejection of my shows that they are distressing to this is because i'm right

1649
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:23,760
and this is often followed

1650
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:29,070
deep psychological problem

1651
01:42:33,150 --> 01:42:35,170
now i don't want to caricature

1652
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:40,030
fraud is a lot of stories have tried and made research program of extending their

1653
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:41,940
ideas scientifically

1654
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:44,400
bringing them to robust scientific test

1655
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:52,880
but the problem is when you make specific falsifiable predictions they don't always do

1656
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:54,010
that well

1657
01:42:54,050 --> 01:42:59,210
so for instance there is no evidence that oral and anal characteristics of personality characteristics

1658
01:42:59,210 --> 01:43:01,380
i talked about above being needed

1659
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:04,760
first is being stingy relate any interesting way

1660
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,730
two winning or toilet training

1661
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:09,130
and there's been some effort cross culturally

1662
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:13,440
to go back to the question is young men as before

1663
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:18,650
looking at cross-cultural differences in toilet training and winning which are really big differences to

1664
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:21,900
see if they correspond in any interesting way

1665
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:27,320
to personality differences and there's been no good evidence supporting that similarly

1666
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:32,840
freud had some strong claims about sexuality for why some people are straight and others

1667
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:33,730
are gay

1668
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:37,710
setting but that's what we're doing this question

1669
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:49,160
i mean

1670
01:43:49,170 --> 01:43:55,450
OK so the question was if you have a couple of hidden variables one of

1671
01:43:55,450 --> 01:43:59,000
which depends on the other one he try to estimate one and then estimate the

1672
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,030
other one

1673
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:03,570
and into a back and forth let's think about this so that in fact the

1674
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:04,810
case here

1675
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:08,510
we're assuming all of these variables are hidden

1676
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:14,250
and what what we're not doing here is estimating

1677
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:18,010
the values of the hidden variables we're not saying

1678
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:26,250
fill in a single value for the hidden variables the actual likelihood function when we

1679
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:32,350
write it out involve summing over all possible values of the hidden variables if you

1680
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:36,840
see what i mean that one approximation to that would be to fill in a

1681
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,510
single value for each of the hidden variables

1682
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:40,360
but that's

1683
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:44,680
strictly speaking an approximation to the likelihood function

1684
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:49,020
any other questions

1685
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:55,220
sorry the

1686
01:44:55,230 --> 01:44:59,270
the general procedure for learning any model

1687
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:03,800
which has parameters and hidden variables there's is a very nice in general procedure for

1688
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:06,970
learning those models and that's the algorithm and i'm sure

1689
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:14,040
most of you have heard of the algorithm but review in the following setting anyway

1690
01:45:15,930 --> 01:45:18,620
so the basic idea is the following

1691
01:45:18,630 --> 01:45:23,200
our goal is to maximize the parameter log likelihood given the observations

1692
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:29,100
and that involves the log of a sum over the hidden variables the probability of

1693
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:33,070
the observed and the hidden variables given the parameters

1694
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:37,220
the intuition behind the algorithm is the following

1695
01:45:37,330 --> 01:45:39,210
we're going to iterate

1696
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:43,440
between the following two steps

1697
01:45:43,450 --> 01:45:45,020
in the e step

1698
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:48,300
which stands for expectation

1699
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:50,200
in the east

1700
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:52,480
we try to fill in

1701
01:45:52,530 --> 01:45:56,900
the hitting or missing variables that's sort of what you suggested

1702
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:03,780
but strictly speaking we're not going to fill in the hidden variables with only a

1703
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:08,560
single setting of those hidden variables we're going to fill them in with all possible

1704
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:09,750
settings of those

1705
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,220
hidden variables

1706
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:15,250
so that's the e step

1707
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:21,260
what we do in the m step is we apply our complete data learning procedure

1708
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:22,900
to that filled in

1709
01:46:24,470 --> 01:46:27,680
so remember if we had completed the

1710
01:46:27,690 --> 01:46:30,980
procedure for learning the parameters was very very easy

1711
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:36,090
that's what i showed you before it just involves calculating certain frequencies so in this

1712
01:46:36,090 --> 01:46:39,860
m step or maximization step what we're going to do is

1713
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:46,580
apply that procedure as if those building values are actually true values

1714
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,020
for the hidden data

1715
01:46:48,030 --> 01:46:50,020
this is the wrong intuition

1716
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:53,310
for what the algorithm does and it works for

1717
01:46:53,410 --> 01:46:56,040
mixtures of gaussians are works for

1718
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:59,140
directed graphs with hidden variables as well

1719
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:03,280
questions about that

1720
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:11,220
let's do the derivation of the algorithm

1721
01:47:11,230 --> 01:47:13,430
in a slightly more formal way

1722
01:47:13,930 --> 01:47:17,110
the idea is the following

1723
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:23,020
we want to maximize this log likelihood l theta

1724
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:28,910
what we can do is we can rewrite our log likelihood

1725
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:31,900
as the lord of the sum over x

1726
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:34,790
this joint probability that we had before

1727
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:38,980
but multiply each term inside the sun

1728
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:43,250
by some distribution over the hidden variables so

1729
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:47,330
we multiply by q of x and we divide by q of x we haven't

1730
01:47:47,330 --> 01:47:51,360
done anything because we multiply all of these terms by one

1731
01:47:52,210 --> 01:47:53,840
what this distribution

1732
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:57,650
represents is

1733
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:01,240
our probability distribution over

1734
01:48:01,290 --> 01:48:04,180
field in values of the hidden variables

1735
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:06,650
so we can think of

1736
01:48:06,670 --> 01:48:07,940
what's the best

1737
01:48:07,950 --> 01:48:12,220
probability distribution with which we can fill in

1738
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:15,200
the values of the hidden variables

1739
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:16,840
that's going to be qpix

1740
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:23,930
the log likelihood is the log of the average with respect to q that's this

1741
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:27,590
of these two probabilities

1742
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:31,380
and now

1743
01:48:31,390 --> 01:48:36,100
we use the fact that the log function is a concave function

1744
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:38,150
so the log of the

1745
01:48:38,170 --> 01:48:40,640
average of something

1746
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,710
is greater than or equal to

1747
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:46,850
of the lord of that something

1748
01:48:46,870 --> 01:48:48,580
and this is simply comes

1749
01:48:48,590 --> 01:48:54,290
from the fact that the log function is concave if we drew any line

1750
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:56,680
connecting two points in the loss function

1751
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:58,320
the law of

1752
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:03,090
average of two points is always

1753
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:04,190
going to be

1754
01:49:04,210 --> 01:49:08,180
greater than or equal to the average of the log of those points

1755
01:49:08,190 --> 01:49:09,560
that holds for

1756
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:13,830
not just two points but averaging with respect to any distribution in any number of

1757
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:16,090
points on this log function

1758
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:21,700
this is called jensen's inequality and you've probably seen before but not it's very simple

1759
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:25,410
consequence of the concavity of the loss function

1760
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:28,140
so what we have now what we have is

1761
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:36,000
things the parameters we had originally

1762
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:39,100
and the distribution over the hidden variables

1763
01:49:39,130 --> 01:49:44,250
OK in this function for any distribution over the hidden variables is the lower bound

1764
01:49:44,270 --> 01:49:46,680
on the log likelihood

1765
01:49:47,470 --> 01:49:52,750
one way to derive the algorithm is simply to say

1766
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:56,810
in the e step of the algorithm we maximize

1767
01:49:56,850 --> 01:50:01,580
this is a lower bound on the log likelihood with respect to

1768
01:50:01,890 --> 01:50:05,150
the distribution over the hidden variables

1769
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:08,370
the parameters fixed

1770
01:50:08,370 --> 01:50:11,180
and i have the voltage over this resistance

1771
01:50:11,210 --> 01:50:13,090
and of course we need to

1772
01:50:13,150 --> 01:50:15,290
must be the current i

1773
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:20,610
article so you solve your problem all the questions that i asked you

1774
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:23,210
you have

1775
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:24,720
the system

1776
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:26,710
we could now

1777
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:28,460
have a slightly different

1778
01:50:30,310 --> 01:50:31,910
by point eight

1779
01:50:33,810 --> 01:50:39,000
now we have resist here which is our long

1780
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:42,840
and we have here are two

1781
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:44,750
this is going

1782
01:50:44,890 --> 01:50:46,980
this is our two

1783
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:50,700
the potential differences being is again given

1784
01:50:52,830 --> 01:50:54,260
and now i could ask ask you

1785
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:56,670
what now is the current

1786
01:50:56,710 --> 01:50:59,670
that will flow here

1787
01:50:59,690 --> 01:51:03,190
and then i can also ask you what is the current that go through one

1788
01:51:03,250 --> 01:51:04,740
this is the one

1789
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:06,180
one of the current

1790
01:51:06,190 --> 01:51:09,010
i could go through too

1791
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:10,940
and i would allow u

1792
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:11,760
to use

1793
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:15,400
on the floor

1794
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:19,980
now you say i have the potential difference from a to b

1795
01:51:19,990 --> 01:51:21,830
going this route

1796
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:25,520
potential difference is free to give

1797
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,250
must not be

1798
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:29,340
i one

1799
01:51:29,370 --> 01:51:30,950
i one

1800
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,420
that is why

1801
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:36,390
with his ograms

1802
01:51:36,450 --> 01:51:38,050
but of course you can also go

1803
01:51:38,130 --> 01:51:40,840
the well around so the saying he

1804
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:43,110
is also i two

1805
01:51:44,310 --> 01:51:48,390
and i j

1806
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:50,960
but whatever current comes in here

1807
01:51:51,870 --> 01:51:55,970
split up between these two think of it as one or

1808
01:51:56,010 --> 01:51:57,520
you cannot

1809
01:51:57,570 --> 01:51:59,320
right of charges

1810
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:02,700
the number of charges per second that flow into this juncture

1811
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:05,070
continue on and so i

1812
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:06,950
coral current

1813
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:09,800
is i one was i

1814
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:11,040
so now

1815
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:12,750
so you have all these

1816
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:15,140
gradients that you need to solve

1817
01:52:15,210 --> 01:52:16,660
for the current i

1818
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:18,070
the current i one

1819
01:52:18,090 --> 01:52:21,510
for the current i two

1820
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:24,230
you can turn it into an industry

1821
01:52:24,230 --> 01:52:26,690
you can make extremely complicated

1822
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:29,120
networks of resistors

1823
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:31,050
and if you in course

1824
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:34,950
you should love it i don't like it at all

1825
01:52:34,990 --> 01:52:38,890
so you don't have to worry about not going to get very complicated resistant that

1826
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,910
networks from me

1827
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:43,670
but in caustic you're going to see a lot of them they're going to

1828
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:53,550
throat and stuff them down your throat

1829
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:55,620
the conductivity

1830
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:59,110
office of substance goes up

1831
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:01,560
if i can increase the number

1832
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:04,810
of charge carriers

1833
01:53:04,830 --> 01:53:07,940
if we have

1834
01:53:08,010 --> 01:53:10,290
dry air

1835
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:13,750
and it is called

1836
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:15,810
then the resistivity

1837
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:19,440
of cold dry air at one atmosphere

1838
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,040
so role

1839
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:23,270
four air

1840
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:30,030
one atmosphere

1841
01:53:30,150 --> 01:53:34,970
called means temperature that we outside

1842
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,650
about four times ten to the thirteenth

1843
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:45,250
that the resistivity of

1844
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:50,010
but what is in this room maybe little

1845
01:53:50,010 --> 01:53:53,500
lower because the temperature is higher

1846
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:54,740
if i he

1847
01:53:54,740 --> 01:53:55,510
it up

1848
01:53:59,290 --> 01:54:02,540
the conductivity the committee will go up

1849
01:54:02,590 --> 01:54:04,310
resistivity will go down

1850
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,200
because now

1851
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:10,370
i created oxygen and nitrogen ions by using up here

1852
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,290
remember when we had this lightning

1853
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:13,850
step came down

1854
01:54:13,870 --> 01:54:15,460
we created channel

1855
01:54:15,470 --> 01:54:19,890
four lions and electrons have very low

1856
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:23,910
resistivity very high conductivity

1857
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:25,350
so what i want

1858
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:28,370
demonstrate to you that when i

1859
01:54:28,390 --> 01:54:31,220
create ions in this room

1860
01:54:31,270 --> 01:54:33,620
then i can actually

1861
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:37,100
make the conductivity of air up tremendous

1862
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:39,450
not only will the electrons move

1863
01:54:39,470 --> 01:54:40,660
but also

1864
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:43,660
the ions now will start to move

1865
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:46,850
and the way i'm going to do that is i'm going to port

1866
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:50,430
on the electroscope

1867
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:53,740
that is not so good

1868
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:55,350
no harm done

1869
01:54:55,370 --> 01:54:58,490
i want to put charge on the electroscope

1870
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:01,290
and you will see that

1871
01:55:01,290 --> 01:55:03,220
and i make the assumption

1872
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:05,690
it is the simplifying assumptions

1873
01:55:05,740 --> 01:55:08,430
that the magnetic field was constant

1874
01:55:08,430 --> 01:55:12,890
over the portion of the wire which was the only ten centimetres

1875
01:55:12,930 --> 01:55:15,930
so i assume you that i have length

1876
01:55:15,930 --> 01:55:18,460
which is o point one meter

1877
01:55:18,530 --> 01:55:20,470
and that in

1878
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:22,400
during in this range

1879
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:25,140
the magnetic field is constant i just want to get

1880
01:55:25,210 --> 01:55:29,140
a rough number for the force on on the wire

1881
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:31,270
so now i can integrate that

1882
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:36,360
equation very easily because i have assumed that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the

1883
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:38,010
the direction dl

1884
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:40,180
l is now in this direction

1885
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:42,420
so to sign of data is one

1886
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:44,960
you don't have to worry about that

1887
01:55:45,010 --> 01:55:51,390
and so i simply get the force on this section after section al that force

1888
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:53,930
f of the if you want to

1889
01:55:53,990 --> 01:55:56,330
is the current i

1890
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:57,570
which we have there

1891
01:55:57,630 --> 01:56:00,150
get the length l which is this link

1892
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,430
by the magnetic field

1893
01:56:03,450 --> 01:56:10,040
there are no sign i anywhere because the angles are ninety degrees

1894
01:56:10,070 --> 01:56:10,790
and so

1895
01:56:10,850 --> 01:56:12,940
i find that force

1896
01:56:13,060 --> 01:56:15,390
three hundred

1897
01:56:15,390 --> 01:56:17,900
times o point one

1898
01:56:17,930 --> 01:56:20,430
five o point two

1899
01:56:20,590 --> 01:56:23,340
of the thirty time point two

1900
01:56:23,380 --> 01:56:24,820
that is about

1901
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:30,220
six nodes

1902
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:31,890
is more than

1903
01:56:31,970 --> 01:56:34,670
the weight of one pound

1904
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:38,410
so it's not so surprising when i took this current on

1905
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:42,190
it's something all of a sudden move that while down

1906
01:56:42,230 --> 01:56:46,480
with the weighted is equivalent of a little more than the almost abandoned have actually

1907
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,270
so it's not so surprising

1908
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:51,520
that the support of

1909
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:53,960
so you see that you can

1910
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:58,160
so this qualitatively provided you make some simplifying assumptions

1911
01:56:58,190 --> 01:57:01,370
about the uniformity of the magnetic field

1912
01:57:01,410 --> 01:57:03,930
and about where the magnetic field

1913
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:08,850
is present

1914
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:12,040
i want to talk about

1915
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:15,370
you know two

1916
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:18,460
more complex

1917
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:22,930
we're about to start all these great automotive contest

1918
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:26,040
one envelope today

1919
01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:29,460
and i'm going to start to tell you slowly about the physics

1920
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:31,230
the goal is ultimately

1921
01:57:31,270 --> 01:57:32,600
to build

1922
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:35,660
a motor

1923
01:57:35,690 --> 01:57:38,230
i have a current loop

1924
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:41,600
is a current loop

1925
01:57:41,620 --> 01:57:43,560
current comes in at a

1926
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:46,850
and i'll try to make it

1927
01:57:46,890 --> 01:57:51,500
make you look at it three-dimensional which is not so easy

1928
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:57,060
this is the current out here the

1929
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:58,890
this is the current loop

1930
01:57:58,910 --> 01:58:04,020
i could go from here we go from here to here and returned here

1931
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:05,770
and we have a magnetic field

1932
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:07,870
i will assume that the magnetic field

1933
01:58:07,870 --> 01:58:09,560
constant throughout

1934
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:11,940
in this area

1935
01:58:11,990 --> 01:58:14,160
there's is the force

1936
01:58:14,210 --> 01:58:15,910
right here

1937
01:58:15,940 --> 01:58:19,290
on this line in the direction i crosby

1938
01:58:19,310 --> 01:58:23,430
it forces up

1939
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:25,560
there is a force field this why

1940
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:28,810
which is of course down magnetic field is in the same direction

1941
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:30,870
current is in the opposite direction

1942
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:32,520
so the force is down

1943
01:58:32,540 --> 01:58:37,500
if this is why it length

1944
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:40,440
why has an length a

1945
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:43,330
that forced the magnitude of the force

1946
01:58:43,370 --> 01:58:45,410
is the current through the wire

1947
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:47,080
the length of the wire

1948
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:49,710
and we feel we just the right thing

1949
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:54,290
is that the integral we just assume that the magnetic field is constant everywhere here

1950
01:58:54,350 --> 01:58:56,140
there are ninety degree angles

1951
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:58,210
so the sign of data is one

1952
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:00,870
so that's the force

1953
01:59:00,930 --> 01:59:03,330
one is the fourth he one of the force here

1954
01:59:03,390 --> 01:59:04,980
but it's zero

1955
01:59:06,310 --> 01:59:08,410
zero here

1956
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,750
it is zero here why is that

1957
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:13,580
because the cross product is zero

1958
01:59:13,670 --> 01:59:17,000
no matter how you look at it you can say dl and we even in

1959
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,690
the same direction or in opposite direction

1960
01:59:19,690 --> 01:59:22,100
you can also say the drift velocity and b

1961
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:25,730
and in the same or the opposite direction all the same thing

1962
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:29,770
there is no force here and there is no force here

1963
01:59:29,790 --> 01:59:33,660
because that equation that we had to give the magnetic force

1964
01:59:33,710 --> 01:59:37,460
become zero sign of that angle is zero

1965
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,890
so what's going to happen with this thing

1966
01:59:39,910 --> 01:59:43,390
well the user talk on this system there is no net force because this force

1967
01:59:43,390 --> 01:59:45,460
of the the same as this for

1968
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:49,850
but there is the talk which wants to rotate in counterclockwise direction

1969
01:59:49,870 --> 01:59:51,770
and the magnitude of the talk

1970
01:59:51,790 --> 01:59:53,330
this of course this fourth

1971
01:59:53,350 --> 01:59:55,060
remember from one

1972
01:59:55,100 --> 01:59:59,120
times the perpendicular distance between these two forces

1973
01:59:59,190 --> 02:00:01,460
so the magnitude of the four

1974
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:02,600
is i

1975
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:04,390
times maybe

1976
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:07,170
been at this moment in time

1977
02:00:07,230 --> 02:00:10,350
when the forces that is far apart

1978
02:00:10,410 --> 02:00:12,390
now this is going to rotate

1979
02:00:12,390 --> 02:00:15,540
and so as they rotated forces come closer

1980
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:16,770
so to talk

1981
02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:18,910
we will become less still

1982
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,060
want to rotate counterclockwise

1983
02:00:22,210 --> 02:00:23,870
there comes time

1984
02:00:23,870 --> 02:00:25,750
ninety degrees later

1985
02:00:25,790 --> 02:00:27,830
that the talk is

1986
02:00:29,620 --> 02:00:33,270
and i'll try to make you see that began in three-dimensional way

1987
02:00:33,290 --> 02:00:35,170
it's not so easy for me

1988
02:00:35,230 --> 02:00:37,160
now this is the

1989
02:00:37,210 --> 02:00:41,690
this has become the current always leaves the

1990
02:00:41,730 --> 02:00:43,850
i tried to make you see is

1991
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:47,810
like this

1992
02:00:47,910 --> 02:00:49,550
current comes in here

1993
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:53,160
we get this

1994
02:00:53,170 --> 02:00:55,750
and we get this

1995
02:00:56,160 --> 02:01:00,290
so bad in the magnetic field b has not changed

1996
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:03,350
in the same direction

1997
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:08,120
so the current comes in through a has not changed

1998
02:01:08,190 --> 02:01:10,500
the only thing is that the model is rotated

1999
02:01:10,520 --> 02:01:13,100
ninety degrees

2000
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:15,790
now i ask you what the forces are

2001
02:01:15,850 --> 02:01:18,060
you have to go i cross

2002
02:01:19,810 --> 02:01:21,560
i crosby

2003
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:24,600
if you do i crosby here i crosby

2004
02:01:24,730 --> 02:01:26,080
can force

2005
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:28,790
which is thought to

2006
02:01:29,930 --> 02:01:33,140
that forces which are in the blackboard

2007
02:01:33,330 --> 02:01:35,850
we get forces which are not

2008
02:01:35,850 --> 02:01:39,350
and you get forces which are down

2009
02:01:39,670 --> 02:01:41,980
you have some time

2010
02:01:42,060 --> 02:01:43,080
use your

2011
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:45,580
right hand and the the i crosby

2012
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:48,370
and you will see that in all these forces

2013
02:01:48,410 --> 02:01:50,310
in the direction

2014
02:01:50,310 --> 02:01:52,770
then i put them

2015
02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:53,910
so now

2016
02:01:53,910 --> 02:01:58,670
is seen in the same language that the language in which we are building ontology

2017
02:01:58,670 --> 02:02:00,810
for instance in the ontology now

2018
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:06,220
and we measured it two ontologies and we get about ontology we can import directly

2019
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:07,810
into our system

2020
02:02:07,860 --> 02:02:09,740
but it could also happen

2021
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:12,720
that in that case i mean it's not number six

2022
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:14,800
in which he

2023
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:17,780
that we merge

2024
02:02:17,790 --> 02:02:23,810
are in another language RDFS for instance and we want your ontology in now we

2025
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:29,250
want to transform after the merging process the ontology into our so after that we

2026
02:02:29,250 --> 02:02:33,290
need to go through some kind of engineering approach

2027
02:02:33,340 --> 02:02:35,420
so once we have the

2028
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:37,850
or these this morning

2029
02:02:37,870 --> 02:02:41,430
and once we would be the new model by using

2030
02:02:41,450 --> 02:02:44,730
non ontological resources ontology can

2031
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:49,650
resources we need probably in integration systems

2032
02:02:49,810 --> 02:02:55,300
the conceptualisation phase two to do some kind of trying to some taxonomy we can

2033
02:02:55,300 --> 02:03:01,830
also extend some of the taxonomies or equal to specialized some ontologies and we need

2034
02:03:01,830 --> 02:03:04,100
more convincing enough

2035
02:03:04,150 --> 02:03:11,630
once we have finished the ontology because the decision activity sometimes we need the ontology

2036
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:14,000
so indians so

2037
02:03:14,090 --> 02:03:17,300
the ontology is in english and they want the ontology and is found in the

2038
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:22,620
space so i can go through the ontology localisation process in order to to to

2039
02:03:22,630 --> 02:03:26,030
it all the ontology labors in another way

2040
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:32,840
and of course you all these activities we should carry out some kind of ontology

2041
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:36,430
support activities like knowledge acquisition

2042
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:37,830
but will be higher

2043
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:44,060
the specification and also the conceptualisation activity we should document the whole process in order

2044
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:47,210
to allow third parties to understand how

2045
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:49,080
we have built our ontology

2046
02:03:49,090 --> 02:03:55,950
we should carry out evaluation modification embodied edition of the the model that we have

2047
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:58,570
so in summary you can see here

2048
02:03:59,190 --> 02:04:02,690
eight it's ideas that we have already e

2049
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:12,280
it to fight for the ontology by means of values and re-engineering of assisting resource

2050
02:04:12,970 --> 02:04:19,530
i am going to explain what had the ontology life cycle model and what have

2051
02:04:19,530 --> 02:04:25,150
they done the ontology lifecycle so so the more the ontology life cycle model is

2052
02:04:25,150 --> 02:04:26,790
the framework that we

2053
02:04:26,810 --> 02:04:29,660
i'm going to use for building the

2054
02:04:29,670 --> 02:04:35,220
the activities that we have already identified in the ontology development process and these ideas

2055
02:04:35,220 --> 02:04:40,330
have taken by from from the software engineering community so when we talk about ontology

2056
02:04:40,330 --> 02:04:44,830
life cycle model that we're talking about following waterfall

2057
02:04:44,850 --> 02:04:49,990
for instance the life cycle more than prototyping or in spite of all OK

2058
02:04:50,010 --> 02:04:54,900
so when but we talk about the ontology lifecycle we

2059
02:04:54,930 --> 02:04:59,670
we refer to the specific sequence of activities that we

2060
02:04:59,690 --> 02:05:01,800
we will carry out when

2061
02:05:01,810 --> 02:05:07,260
we will be our article on ontology so so there

2062
02:05:07,310 --> 02:05:10,010
sometimes i in the

2063
02:05:10,050 --> 02:05:11,390
into more than

2064
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:16,440
if a use a waterfall if if i if i believe the ontology in an

2065
02:05:16,590 --> 02:05:18,450
that if a way

2066
02:05:18,460 --> 02:05:23,660
so based on that depending of the model selected i will get seven ontology lifecycle

2067
02:05:25,630 --> 02:05:32,580
so now the question is that how somebody peloponnese developers and ontology practitioners select the

2068
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:36,780
ontology life cycle model and the particular ontology life cycle for

2069
02:05:36,820 --> 02:05:40,480
i create applications for complete ontology

2070
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:45,420
so the first the first thing to do is to identify which one to use

2071
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:50,580
the second one is to select the ontology life cycle model to use the third

2072
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:54,020
one is to select for from the recommended

2073
02:05:54,060 --> 02:05:58,310
recommended that if applicable table i have already presented before

2074
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:02,510
the set of activities that you need for your application after that you need to

2075
02:06:02,510 --> 02:06:07,560
match the selected activities into the selectors ontology life cycle model in order to get

2076
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:11,380
the ontology life cycle for the user

2077
02:06:13,090 --> 02:06:14,600
the more

2078
02:06:14,610 --> 02:06:21,610
you already know that if if you know already the requirements in the ontology requirements

2079
02:06:21,610 --> 02:06:22,650
at the beginning

2080
02:06:22,780 --> 02:06:27,450
of the ontology development process so probably you can use a water for

2081
02:06:27,540 --> 02:06:33,810
life cycle more than the model incremental more or an interactive mother's

2082
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:40,570
the requirements are not unknown at the beginning of the ontology development private or if

2083
02:06:41,690 --> 02:06:49,430
can change during the project then you can go to our evolutionary prototyping life-cycle model

2084
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:58,950
you changed they ontologies requirements and these changes in the requirements could provoke some kind

2085
02:06:58,950 --> 02:07:04,230
of risk in your ontology project then probably it is more

2086
02:07:04,530 --> 02:07:06,930
it is recommended to going to the spiral

2087
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:12,180
more the results several kind of risk would be that properties became classes or you

2088
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:15,330
move from frame to the l or u

2089
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:22,930
plants use new assistant assistant resources that wasn't in that thought that at the end

2090
02:07:22,930 --> 02:07:25,670
of the the ontology building process

2091
02:07:25,700 --> 02:07:30,240
so in the end you can use this kind of ontology life cycle model decision

2092
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:36,050
tree in order to know which one is the most or the most convenient life-cycle

2093
02:07:36,050 --> 02:07:38,730
model for your application

2094
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:42,800
so there you can see that if the a new you don't want to try

2095
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:44,910
to change the

2096
02:07:44,910 --> 02:07:51,010
the ontology in a requirements you don't want to produce intermediate resource that the full

2097
02:07:51,010 --> 02:07:56,480
model would be OK but if you want to produce intermediate results in in a

2098
02:07:56,490 --> 02:07:57,880
complete manner then

2099
02:07:57,890 --> 02:08:03,220
depending on that you can use it at the forward incrementally much OK so based

2100
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:08,160
on that this kind of questions can help you to select the ontology life cycle

2101
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:11,200
model for your application

2102
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:14,230
once you know that

2103
02:08:14,250 --> 02:08:21,100
this step is to go to these tables they have recommended

2104
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:25,740
four and if applicable or table in order to select those activities but you need

2105
02:08:25,740 --> 02:08:31,040
for your application so probably if you have already been several ontologies you can go

2106
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:35,470
through the stable because of you know which one is the meaning of the different

2107
02:08:35,570 --> 02:08:40,140
article of the different activities but for

2108
02:08:41,310 --> 02:08:46,790
you ontology developers so that we don't have to to many experience in this domain

2109
02:08:46,820 --> 02:08:52,830
what we've done is to create some kind of natural languages questions that will help

2110
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:59,050
people to select an applicable activities so if as i mentioned before if you if

2111
02:08:59,050 --> 02:09:05,220
people doesn't don't dundonald what is ontology localisation one way of knowing the user needs

2112
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:08,280
to the ontology localisation is to ask him or her

2113
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:13,160
if you do you want to have the ontology in twenty different languages english spanish

2114
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:19,920
french yes then you need the ontology localisation so ontology localisation who here and it

2115
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:20,780
is and

2116
02:09:20,790 --> 02:09:25,780
non mandatory or if applicable or activity duplicate there you know to set to to

2117
02:09:25,780 --> 02:09:26,580
say OK

2118
02:09:26,670 --> 02:09:28,790
this is

2119
02:09:28,810 --> 02:09:31,460
this is a selected captivity for

2120
02:09:31,470 --> 02:09:32,710
my ontology
