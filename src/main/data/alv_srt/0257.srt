1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,110
I'd like to start with some short introduction about the place of convex optimization optimization in general and

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,530
then an overview of those three tutorials

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:18,240
so I think everyone's familiar with the standard nonlinear mathematical optimization problem

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:24,380
very optimize and only a function at zero subject to a number of constraints and

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,130
and it's clear that's a very general problem that doesn't need to be motivated because almost any

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,820
engineering design problem any estimation problem can be written in this form

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,240
now unfortunately the General optimization problem is also very untractable

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,950
so in general this problem is very difficult to solve

9
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,520
at least if you mean by minimization you really mean find the best solution

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,310
subject to the constraints

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:02,540
convex optimization is useful or important because roughly speaking the nonlinear optimization problems

12
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,120
that are tractable coincide with the ones that are convex and the boundary between the convex and

13
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,480
unconvex roughly coincides with

14
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,900
easy and difficult problems

15
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:19,710
so in general the general problem's difficult to solve and

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,740
it's also very difficult in general not always easy to recognize the problems that are

17
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,870
and so that's why one of the major topics of this lecture

18
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,040
so there's one the important exception to this

19
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,980
so a class of problems that's well-known to be tractable and also quite easy to

20
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,290
recognize and that's the linear programming problem

21
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,730
there you minimize linear function

22
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,430
subject to a set of linear inequalities

23
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,870
so that was

24
00:01:52,900 --> 00:02:00,120
so actually the study of linear programming more or less starts with or started the feel of mathematical

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:06,900
optimization in general or the study of numerical methods for optimization with dantzigs simplex method in

26
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,330
in the in the end of the

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,560
so dantzig introduced an

28
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,430
efficient method for solving linear programming problems

29
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,590
by computer

30
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,030
the applications had in mind were in logistics and operations planning but then since then

31
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,440
the applications of linear programming have

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,680
and now it's widely used in engineering and operations research also combinatorial optimization and a

33
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,000
wide variety of fields

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,650
and that's a little surprising because the problem itself it's clearly really very specialized because

35
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,340
everything is linear

36
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,610
but that hasn't stopped linear programming from becoming a very important

37
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,960
and widely used technique

38
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,000
and the reason of course is that it's easy to solve people can solve linear programming

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,610
problems of very large scale and that makes it interesting to look for applications of

40
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:09,460
linear programming exactly or with approximations and also it's makes it useful as an

41
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:14,930
subproblem or to solve subproblems in combinatorial or non-convex or

42
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:21,500
discrete optimization problems that you solve combinatorial problems by branch and bound and then every

43
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:27,060
subproblem is a linear programming problem and then the scalability of the entire method

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,110
comes from the

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,770
tractability of the linear programming problem

46
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:39,620
so for convex optimization it's more or less the same story except that this

47
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,780
it's more recent so convex optimization problem

48
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,640
been applied for maybe at last twenty

49
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,890
years or so

50
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,650
and other differences with linear programming is that it's a of course much more general because

51
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,870
you can allow the functions in the objective and the constraints to be nonlinear they

52
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,560
have to be convex so it's a very substantial extension of linear programming

53
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,090
therefore is also more difficult to recognize simple linear programming problems

54
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,920
but many of the other prop properties of linear programming also hold for convex

55
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,530
optimization so it's very tractable and we see that methods that people have developed or

56
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,540
some of some of the methods for linear programming extend very easily to

57
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,320
general nonlinear convex optimization problems

58
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,330
and it's also

59
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,510
it's used in a variety of applications but also in for non

60
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,400
convex problems as the basis of either

61
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,770
to be used in

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,450
exact global optimization problems or heuristics or

63
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,460
similar techniques

64
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:56,530
so some brief histories I mentioned linear programming at the start of the whole

65
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:02,720
development of mathematical programming then during the fifthies people extended linear programming to include an

66
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,090
quadratic objective function so the first extension they made was to replace the linear objective by quadratic

67
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,070
convex objective and that's a quadratic programming problem

68
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,650
at the end of the nineteen sixties it was sort of a maybe a smaller development it's called

69
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,950
and let's take let's take an example and I

70
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:29,900
and see how these and as an example let's take sulfur real chloride

71
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,870
so as to make it a little complicated

72
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,990
the to

73
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,470
right so don't worry about it

74
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,210
these compounds and I will tell you all you need to know we we have

75
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:46,250
accepted and how to draw and it says OK center the element with the lowest

76
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:52,410
average valence electron energy well if you look in year solvers less than chlorine which

77
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:58,630
is less than oxygen solver has the lowest average valence electron energy so

78
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,400
that's what the sulphur in the centre

79
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:09,620
right to put the sovereign is count of valence electrons well solver has 6 that's

80
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,910
the 3 s 2 3 to 4

81
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,700
on oxygen from 2 times and that's 12

82
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:24,650
because it's solvers to pass through to the for

83
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,320
and calorimeters to those

84
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:36,330
that gives us 40 and has 3 2 3 . 5 so we gotta come

85
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,990
up with

86
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,920
we have 32 electrons we have to use

87
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:47,530
OK and there's draw a single bond from each surrounding to the central atom and

88
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,730
subtract 2

89
00:06:49,750 --> 00:07:00,620
valence electrons OK and let's just put chlorine here current year options options here so

90
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:09,270
2 4 6 8 minus and that gives us 24 so we have 24 electrons

91
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,990
we have to we have to come up with an answer is OK

92
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:19,530
distribute the remaining electrons in pairs so that each atom has a place the nonbinding

93
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:24,690
pairs on peripheral 1st which the higher average valence electron energy

94
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:31,070
right well oxygen has the highest valence electron energy so

95
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:38,120
let's go and put them 1 2 3 4 5 6 here but still 1

96
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:47,300
2 3 4 5 6 here and Tokyo and last but but but the around

97
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,690
now the the chlorines glorious have set right so

98
00:07:52,690 --> 00:08:01,250
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2

99
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,480
the war

100
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:07,170
and says OK so now you got

101
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:15,360
take an electron from that solver but here's electron from that soldier put it here

102
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,750
so we have solve we got 1 2

103
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,770
3 4 5 6 7

104
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,150
so 1 2 3 4 5 6 sulfur

105
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,930
1 2 6 we have 6 we use all the electron

106
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,190
but what we have here as well

107
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,150
this chlorine has taken 1 electron from the self

108
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,350
but the oxygen has taken 2 electrons from the

109
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:54,070
this is a kind of a special but when and you might expect that option

110
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,930
has the highest average valence electron energy so it's gonna wanna stop and take these

111
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,990
and take these electrons this is called data

112
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:15,360
I want this is what it's called when when anatomist takes both electrons the bond

113
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,470
right so what have we have 1

114
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,470
we have 1 2 4

115
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:34,730
binding domains and how many bonding well 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

116
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,560
9 10 11 12

117
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:48,970
12 non bonding nonbonding 12 nonbinding domains

118
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,970
OK so this is looking pretty good we now have we got octet stability we've

119
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:02,210
got to know each each 1 is has a has an inert electronic structure

120
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:08,310
but a few things to note we notice because the sulfur and the chlorine in

121
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,710
the auction have different average valence electron energies of different electron affinities

122
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,930
this bond is going to be a little bit different than this bond we have

123
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,450
to account for that in some way because we know they don't have identical average

124
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:28,310
valence electron energy OK

125
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,760
OK let's try another

126
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:49,630
let's try something like

127
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,570
for which is what method

128
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,650
that what we know about nothing what we know is stable

129
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,120
but we also know

130
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:09,850
that is symmetric right it's symmetric

131
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,510
we know that it's not

132
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:18,710
it's polar right so those are the things that we those things that we know

133
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,750
about we also know that carbon

134
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:27,350
it is 1 s 2 2 s 2 2 s p 2

135
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,470
and we know invited we know hydrogen is and so if we look at our

136
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,670
our box

137
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:39,610
or box notation right we've got 3 states in the p orbital we got 1

138
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,470
in the in the s orbital if we apply the hunt the hunt the hunt

139
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:50,930
rule but we got a barrel down Arrow

140
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,050
but something else that we know

141
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,750
right we somehow have to take hydrogen attach at the carbons and we have to

142
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,820
make it symmetric and we have to make it not

143
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,010
we have to make non polar

144
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,630
and yet we know

145
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,580
that the shape of the shape of the s orbitals spherical

146
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:17,010
the shape of the p orbitals however not spherical it's it's asymmetric and moreover

147
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,850
this one should be easy because of this the total revenue

148
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,650
f double prime site why

149
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,870
times one times one

150
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,360
but what's there

151
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,750
but it's the y white

152
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:41,400
of this thing you see what's happening it's got a factor either constant

153
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,730
and now want i take another derivative get f double prime

154
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,880
and i had the old five from the first derivative but now the chain rule

155
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,840
for the next the river also producing and i so there's a nice query and

156
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:02,130
which is the exactly the minus one were hoping so it all

157
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,440
i really felt

158
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,660
fell apart when we used icebreaker minus one

159
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,670
so i i'm

160
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,130
i'm happy and two or three ways here one way is that we've got this

161
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,210
good list of solutions

162
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,800
except that they're getting somewhat messier

163
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,390
to describe

164
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,990
so we would really like to have a better

165
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,610
description of this specialist

166
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,650
where the function is just the power

167
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,230
and now and then the second thing i'm happy about is to have

168
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,040
begun to see

169
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,990
the magic of these of living

170
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:49,390
having this perfectly real equation but solving it by means of complex

171
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:56,950
which is just like which by the way everybody might say OK what about three-dimensional

172
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,880
UX experts pursue libraries uses equal zero well that things don't happen don't work

173
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,930
so it's really quite special to two dimensions

174
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,090
unfortunately but

175
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,050
everybody is tried but nobody is going to work

176
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,230
i i come back to this list from it just make it just to improve

177
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,650
the the

178
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,550
the looks of it

179
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,570
and how to do that

180
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,600
go to polar coordinates

181
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,120
go from x and y

182
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,910
are in state

183
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,290
because we're in the plane so we have a choice and x y is rectangular

184
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,060
are and say to you know of course is

185
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,440
polar so let's write in what is x in terms of our fate

186
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,860
just remember

187
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,170
remember this picture of polar according

188
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,800
here here we go out x

189
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,740
right we go up y and distances

190
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,160
or the and was made

191
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,240
so the point is

192
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,420
it just is given by the numbers are inside

193
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,400
as well as by the numbers x and y

194
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,620
and then x in this triangle is you were saying

195
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,720
these are times

196
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,410
cosine theta

197
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,560
and why

198
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,990
these are times something

199
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,130
in other words i can now

200
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:33,040
replace every x y are costly theta and every y by our science

201
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,990
and what i want to say is that all come out quite beautifully

202
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,470
i mean that this

203
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:43,160
br cos they this is our science this one will turn out to be

204
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,690
are squared cost two things

205
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,540
so let me put

206
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,120
race one and zero three this is a list of

207
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,660
the end cos

208
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,750
this is a list of are actually and

209
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,210
yes sign

210
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,340
and theta

211
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,160
so this is the

212
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:11,330
the ones on this list which looked like getting message here are really not in

213
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,650
polar coordinates

214
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,900
those are the

215
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,620
those are quite

216
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,340
why did why is that true

217
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,660
how do i see that OK

218
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,340
i'm economic so i should just do this experts i y to the end

219
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,020
let me just to do i'm i'm taking the real i got that list by

220
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,090
taking the real and imaginary parts of experts i y

221
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,920
but now

222
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:49,310
what's experts i y if i go into polar

223
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,310
that's the key what is experts i y polar court that's that's

224
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,600
the beautiful

225
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,380
so if you think that have come out well

226
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:04,350
and what is to come out of it are times in the i think

227
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,990
see that that's right because

228
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,380
this is the i say that is

229
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,900
this is

230
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,550
this is are

231
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,880
it the think as we said about the the i y is cos later

232
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,170
plus i size

233
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,180
sure of our cost they agree with x

234
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,900
and are assigned to a degree twice with a beautiful formula

235
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,730
so it's really just the real and imaginary parts

236
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,590
or either i think

237
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:42,300
to the and power

238
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,710
so you see how to tidy it is when the thing is i guess the

239
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,360
rule is when you're like multiplayer taking powers polar is really nice

240
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
because when you're multiplying complex numbers

241
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,290
just multiply the origin and the angles

242
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:03,260
it is that it's going to happen if i multiply are either i say the

243
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:08,830
times TV i alpha then all multiplayer and t

244
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,600
and all the exponent although they have

245
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:19,230
so all in this case whereas adding complex numbers is better over this

246
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,240
px y sus

247
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,520
multiplying is much better here in taking powers

248
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:29,400
even better still because we have articles and power

249
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,380
e to the end theme

250
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,290
and we can sure take the real part of that

251
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,810
because at all split into

252
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,070
just like this

253
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,930
now i have and say this so little split the cosine and say that and

254
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,430
science i science data and then

255
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,360
the real part will be

256
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,600
cosine part

257
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,220
so these sorry that these two

258
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,880
steps are so widely separated on the board

259
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,820
that these this pair

260
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,870
in polar coordinates is exactly the

261
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,630
so far into the board the real and imaginary parts of or the

262
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,120
so are cost

263
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,910
that's where there

264
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,120
that's a lot of what i wanted to mention

265
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,940
about explicit solution

266
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,520
we have this terrific list here

267
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,640
which is pretty nearly pretty much a complete list with its combinations or we can

268
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,650
jump and take something like this example

269
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,850
which might be appropriate for a particular geometry

270
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,580
what do i mean by particular geometry what the

271
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,660
with our knowledge of talk

272
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,670
come down

273
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,580
on knowledge of torque and angular momentum

274
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,500
we can now

275
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,680
rolling objects which roll down

276
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,400
a slow

277
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,020
for instance the following

278
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,540
i have here

279
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,340
senator or it could be sphere or for that matter

280
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,990
this angle is been

281
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,780
i prefer not to use all five because that

282
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,530
angular acceleration

283
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,530
and there's this friction coefficient with is the surface you know

284
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,490
and this

285
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,310
going to roll down

286
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,910
going to get an acceleration in this direction

287
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,740
and i will evaluate

288
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,340
the situation

289
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,380
when we have a pure role that means the object is not skating and is

290
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,090
not slipping

291
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,600
what is pure OR

292
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,980
if here

293
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,650
senator sphere

294
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,570
was israelis are

295
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,710
and i'm going to rotate it like this

296
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,350
role in this direction

297
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,010
centre got

298
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,570
called on q

299
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,320
once it has made a complete rotation

300
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,180
then the point q

301
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,850
has moved over the distance two pi r

302
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,680
we call that

303
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,260
if you're role

304
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,870
when we have pure all

305
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,070
the velocity

306
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,880
of this point q

307
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,010
and the

308
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,680
of this conference

309
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,870
you can read that this policy there

310
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,400
i had the same

311
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,520
in other words

312
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,060
exactly the same

313
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,410
it has to be

314
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,620
the conference

315
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,370
and these are conferences is always omega are this part always holds

316
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,090
but for pure

317
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,170
this holds

318
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,790
you can easily imagine

319
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,300
that if there is no friction here

320
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,610
if you object could be standing still

321
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,110
rotating like crazy

322
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,880
but you wouldn't go anywhere

323
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,260
but then we have skating and we're slipping

324
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,480
and then we don't have the pure all situation

325
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,100
if the object is getting was slipping then the friction must always be a maximum

326
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,820
if the object is impure role

327
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,010
the fiction could be substantially less

328
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,820
then the maximum friction

329
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,980
now i would like to calculate this you

330
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,980
the acceleration that the cylinder would obtain

331
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,890
when it pure rolls down that slope has mass and

332
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,500
it has length l

333
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,970
it has radius or

334
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,980
i would like you to use your intuition

335
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,220
and don't be afraid it's wrong

336
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,600
i'm going to roll down this inclined to silliness

337
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,610
they're both solid

338
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,360
they have the same as

339
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,950
they have the same length but they are very different in radii

340
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,670
good ever race between these two

341
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,570
which one will reach the bottom first

342
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,040
so i repeat the problem

343
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,940
two cylinders both solid

344
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,200
same length

345
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,220
same as

346
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,820
one has a lot is the

347
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,230
it's going to be a race going to roland on bureau

348
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,910
which one will win win real with

349
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:16,480
o things that the one with the largest radius will win

350
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,820
think the large with the smallest radius win

351
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,170
well things there will be no winner loser

352
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,380
the intuition is better than mine was we'll see how it goes

353
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,570
keep in mind what you thought was

354
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,080
and you will see it come out very shortly

355
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,630
OK let's put all the forces on this object that we know

356
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,700
this one is mg

357
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,010
and we're going to decompose that

358
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,320
in two

359
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,250
one along the slope

360
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,450
which is and g

361
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,280
sign beta

362
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,250
and one

363
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,360
perpendicular to the slope we've done that still zillions times

364
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,540
and this one was and he

365
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,580
cosine data

366
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,290
then there is right here

367
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,160
normal force

368
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:09,420
and the magnitude of the normal forces and cosine data

369
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,340
but there is no acceleration in this direction

370
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,920
and then we have

371
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,620
frictional force here

372
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,800
which i will write f of f

373
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,840
there is an anger

374
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,990
velocity at any moment in time omega which will change with time no doubt

375
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,960
and then

376
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,100
this centre point q

377
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,090
which is the centre of mass

378
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,850
it's going to

379
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,750
velocity v

380
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,110
and that we also change with time

381
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,290
and the

382
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,960
of the point q

383
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,690
which changes with time

384
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,210
of this conference because that is the condition of pure all

385
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,550
that equals omega ark

386
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,840
this is always true

387
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,050
but this is only true and pure all

388
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,990
i take the time derivative

389
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,850
the derivative of the velocity of that point q

390
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,100
it's for definition it's acceleration

391
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,940
so i get a equals only dot

392
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:13,480
times are because of our of being the angular acceleration

393
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,340
so this

394
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,410
is the condition

395
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,350
now i'm going to take to talk

396
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,920
about point q

397
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,000
when i think the talk about point q

398
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,440
on the first page

399
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,790
he has an address

400
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,000
and it's an address

401
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,520
for unicef

402
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,520
which is the united nations children's fund

403
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,830
and he starts his book

404
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:47,440
that address where you could send money right now that was very impressive put that

405
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,310
on page one of the book

406
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:54,170
because it puts the reader in moral dilemma

407
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:00,290
he points out that it's estimated that for every three dollars you to unicef

408
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,310
you can save a life

409
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,670
that's because there are people in this world who are not getting

410
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,790
medical care

411
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:14,000
there are people who are dying of diseases for which there are no known cures

412
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,230
because they don't have

413
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:21,270
the the best method which are often not even expensive but they living in such

414
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,560
so he says

415
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,870
why don't you

416
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,500
stop right now

417
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,020
and send a hundred dollars to units OK

418
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,000
and it was very impactful to start a book that way

419
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,330
because i doubt that hardly any readers

420
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,960
actually write out to check on this perhaps the unicef

421
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,600
and if you don't then you are in some sense responsible

422
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,150
for the loss of thirty lives

423
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:50,350
and so it's quite striking that helps you to reflect

424
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,000
and what makes us

425
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,870
what makes us

426
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,560
behave the way we do it by the way

427
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,870
when you go back to your computer

428
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,710
the unicef

429
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,540
and you can get one hundred dollars to unicef

430
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,730
with you can do it within the hour OK

431
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:13,460
maybe i could ask for a show of hands how many people do

432
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,710
i expect that not many of the world

433
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,230
i don't think that proves that you're bad people this is a very interesting philosophical

434
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:25,190
but what it means is that

435
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,870
there is a moral dilemma underlying all of our economic lives

436
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:38,460
and i think this moral dilemma is the same as the moral dilemma in finance

437
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:44,540
in the financial is just the people in finance are sometimes very successful

438
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:49,000
and they could give a lot more than one hundred dollars to unicef

439
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,770
the one thing that i want to emphasise in this course

440
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,710
i'll try to emphasise his

441
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,500
part of finance

442
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,960
it is actually full philanthropy

443
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,330
and so

444
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,890
the most important most successful people

445
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,290
in finance i believe and

446
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,850
giving the money away OK

447
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,000
and that means

448
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,980
you can't consume a billion dollars

449
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,440
there's no way that you can do that

450
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,460
what they end up you you can only drive one car at time right hand

451
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,040
if you have five cars

452
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,850
well i mean that's kind of

453
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,690
all right you could have five cars you you could drive a different one every

454
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,540
day but it's starting to

455
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,730
similarly ridiculous right

456
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,710
and anyway are not using them in the end up used by somebody else

457
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:45,190
i think the the outcome should be

458
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,920
and so those of you who are successful

459
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,210
really ought to give it away

460
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,330
so i'm bringing in outside speakers as part of this course

461
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,120
and i'm going to

462
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,460
among them bring in people who i think have been

463
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,020
philanthropist that that's the

464
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,150
that's the mode of thinking that

465
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,830
that is most attractive when you think about financial markets

466
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,650
so let me tell you about i have slots now for four outside speakers have

467
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,270
lined up to them

468
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,830
and then we tell you

469
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,650
about the two that have already lined up

470
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:26,170
the first one is our own david swenson

471
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,000
david swanson

472
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,690
came to

473
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,960
yale university

474
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,730
in nineteen eighty five

475
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,650
from wall street although he's yeah he was a year graduate

476
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:43,040
at that time the you know

477
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,560
the above

478
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:52,370
actually slightly under one billion dollars what what's the endowment of the endowment is defined

479
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,150
as the financial assets that yale university owns

480
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,370
yeah also has an art collection

481
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,150
which is worth many billions

482
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,870
we don't count that as part of the endowment because they will never sell it

483
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,420
and so it doesn't provide income for us and you also has

484
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,620
the physical plant like this beautiful building that we're in

485
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,100
that's not part of the endowment either the financial assets that has

486
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,940
at that time were

487
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,730
about a billion dollars

488
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,540
since then

489
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:31,020
david swinson has invested has managed investment

490
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,920
of this and that

491
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,170
it has

492
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,190
done phenomenally well so it's now

493
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,620
over twenty two billion dollars

494
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,460
that you know has in its endowment

495
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,150
and so he returned that he got

496
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,750
from nineteen ninety six to two thousand six

497
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:56,310
seventeen percent a year

498
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,080
and investment

499
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,480
last year

500
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,310
the return on the portfolio

501
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:06,390
it was twenty eight percent in one year

502
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,350
now i don't know how impressed you're you're before that it was twenty two percent

503
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,460
in one year

504
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,040
now some of this might be like

505
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,460
but i don't think it's all love because he's done this consistently for so many

506
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,170
if you look up around this campus now to see a lot of construction a

507
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:28,020
lot of things are being spruced up and improve well that's

508
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,730
you know i think david swanson has had a big hand in doing that

509
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,620
it's having the money that makes it possible

510
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,920
and so

511
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,600
you know the endowment yale is something like two million dollars per student now

512
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,420
that's just sitting there

513
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,250
as money that could be spent

514
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,920
and so

515
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,230
how did you do this one of the amazing things that it seems to have

516
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,900
something to do i think with academic

517
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,560
that being part of the university community

518
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,790
is a good thing for investing

519
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:08,390
and you can see some evidence in that in that

520
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:14,580
harvard university princeton university and and other universities have done extremely well on the endowments

521
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,560
however not quite as well as you know i think is the number one performer

522
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,810
so it is very interesting that we're able is very significant that were able to

523
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,270
get david swanson

524
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:30,290
he doesn't do a lot of public speaking that he is willing for for

525
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:33,150
young people like you who to do this

526
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,000
that's one of our outside speak you also has two books about investing

527
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,080
here's the wine glass

528
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,950
the same series is

529
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,440
that one

530
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:48,340
by the time when he got it to work with about five hundred of those

531
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:51,960
classifica article discount by the way because we were wanted to be sure that we

532
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,920
can do it for years to come

533
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,540
so here's the wine glass

534
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,020
and here is the loudspeaker

535
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:02,690
and we're going to generate sounds very close to the resonance frequency of these class

536
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,460
which we

537
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,590
i have already determined before you came in four hundred

538
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,830
eight hertz

539
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,160
good you see the glass there

540
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:16,630
and to make you see actually this wonderful motion of the class we'll struggle with

541
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,580
his lights

542
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,330
at the frequency is slightly different from the frequency

543
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,890
of the sounds of it you see

544
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,020
the glass moved

545
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,320
very slowly

546
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,560
and then we will increase the volume of the speaker

547
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,830
and then we some look if we have right of residence

548
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,460
the glass may actually break

549
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,370
i think this is the sound that you're going to hear at low volume

550
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:45,440
and i think i can on the

551
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,960
strobe light now

552
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,830
you can make it dark

553
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:56,220
and i want to warn you

554
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,670
that the sound levels

555
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:02,080
it's going to be quite high i will have to protect might use

556
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:11,000
and you actually may have to do the same i will first increase the

557
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,320
volume of the sound see where i close enough to residents

558
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,810
artists motion vectors

559
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,570
is the result

560
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,470
this trail

561
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,130
which is not exactly the same frequency as the glass

562
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,920
i can change that

563
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,520
all right

564
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,230
so we're very close to resonance

565
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,650
classes community responded to this song

566
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,040
and i will

567
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,390
some ideas

568
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,440
and slowly increases

569
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,870
sound volume

570
00:34:51,020 --> 00:35:25,610
take take you you'd do you know that it was ik ik r by or

571
00:35:25,610 --> 00:36:14,390
won't stay in d in s impaled thought in or about getting thoresen but get

572
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:30,350
in get in document d and e rhe mm

573
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:40,610
the cost less

574
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,430
i think you will probably agree with me now that

575
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:51,410
multiplying out this product you know explicitly one plus X 1 y 1 bracket one

576
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:57,150
plus a x plus 2 y 2 bracket and so on when you multiply out basically

577
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:01,290
at each bracket you have to say whether you're going to include or not include

578
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:05,630
the the explicit features either you gonna use one or you gonna use XI

579
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:15,850
YI so every combination of including or not including XI YI will occur in that

580
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:21,510
multiplying out so they'll be two the n possible products and each will correspond to

581
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:28,370
some subset of the XI YI being selected and the others being ignored and that

582
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:33,250
corresponds exactly to the sum over all of the subsets of XI of 1 up

583
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:40,930
to n up with the product of those that are selected so this now of course can

584
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,250
be evaluated very efficiently in the input space here you just gotta multiply the

585
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:52,230
corresponding feature together at one and product up so it's basically pretty much the same

586
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:57,890
as doing a an inner products a normal inner product in the input space

587
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:07,030
except that you have one extra edition for each hem feature and you multiply them together instead of adding

588
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:12,230
them together normally you would you know just sum XI YI now you're producting XI YI plus

589
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:18,810
one but clearly this is not a big overhead and you've evaluated this you know

590
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,090
exponentially large sum in a direct way

591
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:27,290
so this is this is sort of a very sort of archetypal example of the kind of

592
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:32,870
tricks that can be made in order to do these kernel evaluations in these very

593
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:40,530
complex feature spaces efficiently and you know many of them involve swapping some products so

594
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:45,590
one way  to think of this and to sort of think of these types of algorithms is

595
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:54,310
to make a graph representation of them and the way I I've drawn the graph

596
00:38:54,310 --> 00:39:02,310
that would correspond to this kernel here and what we see here is essentially the

597
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:09,370
each of the stages in the graph corresponds to one  of these elements in this

598
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:15,170
product so in this we have either one or X one plus X one

599
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,350
Y one in the next element we have one or X two Y two and

600
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:27,510
so on and then the features that we're actually summing over correspond to all the possible parts

601
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:33,890
between source and sink so the source is the first vertex sink is the last vertex so every

602
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:41,450
path through this graph corresponds to one of these features and the the evaluation

603
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:49,110
of that feature corresponds to multiplying all of the labels on that path so here you know

604
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:55,910
say we've selected one times X two Y two times X three Y three times

605
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:03,030
one  etcetera and so on so obviously now it's even clearer that the parts exactly

606
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:07,710
can be characterized by whether they go on the one path or the X one Y one

607
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:15,250
and so they're characterized by a subset of the of the features one

608
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:21,250
up to N  the subset selecting when you go in the lower arch and when you

609
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:26,470
go in the upper arch exactly every subset corresponds to one path and so there

610
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:34,670
are two N paths and and so those are the features that you're actually evaluating over and this

611
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:40,750
argument that I made here about the equivalents of these two corresponds to summing over these

612
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:49,530
features by dynamic programming method okay so that's a very simple case but we can

613
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:55,350
also do it for the polynomial case so here in the polynomial case we have

614
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,130
D vertices corresponding to the dimension the products that we're thinking so this

615
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:06,590
is the polynomial kernel dimension where you take a constant plus the inner product add them together

616
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:12,750
and then take it all to the power D and now so in this case we have archs

617
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:19,350
one for each possible thing that we could have in this bracket here so the

618
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:23,270
bracket is X one Y plus X two Y two plus R so there's a

619
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:30,170
arch for each of those possible terms in that and then there's one

620
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:38,250
step in this graph for each of the multiplications the outside multiplications D steps here and

621
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:43,710
notice in this case all of them are the same and again every path

622
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:53,710
corresponds to a one feature in the feature space and the kernel corresponds to summing all

623
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:58,650
of the possible  overall of the possible paths the products of all of the

624
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:05,110
features one that path and again this corresponds to a dynamic programming algorithm that

625
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:11,890
essentially computes the the thing step by step and it turns out it's

626
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:17,110
just a product of each of these each of these components so it's just race

627
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:25,330
to the deep R here okay so now there's a quite well known kernel called the anova kernel

628
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:33,470
which is a slightly different arises from a slightly different graph and what

629
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:38,510
this does is trying just select up to D features so the same types of

630
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:46,690
features we're selecting and so the way it's organized is that the rows correspond

631
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:51,930
to not selecting a feature so if you just move along here you

632
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:55,690
don't select the feature if you select the feature you drop down to the next

633
00:42:55,690 --> 00:43:00,390
row and what you have to do is to drop down D times to get

634
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,410
to this final vertex here so essentially  it's a bit difficult to see but

635
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:10,590
this is much longer than it's deep if you see what I mean I haven't drawn it very well but

636
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:14,930
it's sort of  long and thin and you basically have to go down D times

637
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:19,690
to reach the bottom point and  the point at which you move down corresponds

638
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:25,010
to the particular feature that you selected so you have to select D features from

639
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:31,690
among the N possible features and each path because you can never go back up

640
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:38,640
each path corresponds to selecting exactly D features and there's one path for each possible combination

641
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:43,510
of D features and so again that corresponds to the that is exactly how the anova

642
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:52,250
kernel is defined as the features being every possible combination of D features and

643
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:59,010
again you can evaluate it by a dynamic programming you basically start with the kernel at

644
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:06,190
this in this row and then evaluate over each row in succession until you

645
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:11,270
as long as the solution curve stays convex concave

646
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,410
well that's probably

647
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,880
two optimistic is probably more like this

648
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,660
so in other words in this case if the curve is convex

649
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,820
the soil oilers going to be too high

650
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:28,760
necessary to low

651
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,420
let's forty four

652
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:36,630
oilers too low if it's concave then oiler is too high

653
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,070
OK that's great

654
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,330
they just one little problem left

655
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:48,930
if we don't have a formula for the solution and we don't have a computer

656
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,230
this busy drawing picture for us

657
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,000
in which case we would need any of this anyway

658
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:57,520
how are we supposed to tell if it's convex or concave

659
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:05,740
back to calculus calculus to the rescue

660
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:14,630
one is a curve convex curve is convex if its second derivative is

661
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,640
positive because

662
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:21,740
the first to be convex means the first derivative is increasing over time

663
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:26,220
and therefore the second derivative which is the derivative of the first derivative should be

664
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,810
just the opposite here the curve the slope is

665
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:36,030
the first derivative is decreasing over time and therefore the second derivative is negative

666
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:40,010
so all we have to do is decide what the first and second what the

667
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:43,200
derivative the second derivative of this solution is

668
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,800
let's of we should probably call the solution to y of x will today

669
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:53,160
why one means the solution that started at this point so in fact probably would

670
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,570
have been better from the beginning to call that y one except there is no

671
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:03,210
why one would say that means the solution which started out at the point zero

672
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,150
so i'm still talking about the solution like that right

673
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,920
so i want to know if

674
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:14,750
this is positive the second derivative is positive at the starting point zero or negative

675
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,490
again you calculate the second derivatives do

676
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,420
and even if you don't know what the solution is explicitly and the answer is

677
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:28,160
you can do it from the differential equation itself

678
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,510
i do that well

679
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,730
easy why prime equals x squared minus y squared OK

680
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,910
that tells me how to calculate

681
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,180
why prime

682
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,900
if i know the value of x and y in other words the point zero

683
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,390
what would be the value y double prime well

684
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,060
differentiate the equation

685
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,530
two x

686
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,820
minus two y

687
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:56,390
why prime don't forget to use the chain rule

688
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,600
i want to calculate and zero one

689
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:07,570
in other words my starting point is that curve convex or concave

690
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,170
let's calculate y is zero equals one

691
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:17,520
OK what's what primers zero well i don't have to repeat that calculation using this

692
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,720
i already calculated that it was negative one

693
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,580
now the new thing is what's why double prime zero

694
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,990
well it is this

695
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,920
it's right to

696
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,240
time zero

697
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,720
minus two

698
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,930
negative y which is one

699
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,260
two times one

700
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:42,160
times y prime which is negative when you want to see we're pulling ourselves up

701
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:48,160
our own bootstraps which is impossible but it is not impossible because we're doing it

702
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:52,800
so what's the answer

703
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,240
zero here

704
00:47:55,470 --> 00:48:00,910
i've calculated without having the foggiest idea what the solution is and how it looks

705
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:05,100
i calculated that second derivative of the starting point is to

706
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:08,490
therefore my solution is convex

707
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:13,280
at the starting point and therefore the soil approximation if i don't carry it out

708
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,980
too far will be

709
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:21,710
it's convex boiler to us

710
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:31,580
now you can argue that the world would the

711
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,640
the you know

712
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,190
i it

713
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,670
so you go like this is that then

714
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,840
but then it see it catches up with them so

715
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,660
well of of course if the curve changes from convex to concave then

716
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,890
it's really impossible to make any prediction at all

717
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,580
that's the difficulty

718
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:01,090
so all this analysis is only if you stay very near by

719
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:08,060
however i wanted to show you the main purpose of in my mind was to

720
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:13,100
show you how to use the diff it's these equations how to use the differential

721
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,970
equation itself

722
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:23,850
to get information about the solutions without actually being able to calculate the solutions

723
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,160
so that's the that's how to find out something about now what i'd like to

724
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,000
talk about is

725
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,920
how do i handle

726
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:46,070
so i mean that's in now in a sense i started the year analysis

727
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,300
in other words

728
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,600
the error by definition of the area is this difference

729
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:52,750
the arabic

730
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,390
so in other words i'm asking here is the are positive

731
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:59,150
as it would be

732
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:03,090
it depends which way you measure usually take this line is that so you the

733
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,460
here would be considered positive here would be considered negative although i'm sure there's a

734
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,840
book somewhere in the world which does the opposite

735
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,340
page by just using the absolute value of the year

736
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:23,640
what's the statement that the method is producing answers which are too low

737
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,750
or two i

738
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,530
the question then is naturally

739
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:38,090
it's not the world's best method it's not as bad as it seems

740
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:44,370
it's not the world's best method because that convexity in concavity means that you automatically

741
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:45,140
and do

742
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:48,530
introducing a systematic error

743
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,840
if you can predict which way the error is going to be by just knowing

744
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,220
what the curve is convex to concave

745
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,070
it's just is that what you want i mean you want a least have a

746
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:05,390
chance of getting the right answer this is telling you you're definitely going to get

747
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:07,900
the wrong answer all it tells you is

748
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,450
and it's telling you because your answers can be too high or too low

749
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:16,030
we'd like a better chance of getting the right answer now

750
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:23,610
so the question is how do you get a better method

751
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:28,270
searches for a better man

752
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:36,340
the first method which will occur i'm sure to anyone who looks at that picture

753
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:40,710
look if if you want this yellow line to follow

754
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,840
the white one

755
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,670
the white solution more accurately

756
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:49,910
it's difficult to the thing i have always trouble explaining

757
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:53,020
maybe i've never found a good way to explain to me it seems clear what

758
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,910
it means but it doesn't help you

759
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,370
one way to put it is this you have a program which consists of zero

760
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:02,720
and one bits and you want to measure the amount of information in a algorithm

761
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,190
in the program

762
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:05,450
but you see

763
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:09,250
in a way with the old definition from the nineteen sixties the program size complexity

764
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,750
where most and bit strings need

765
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:13,750
need programs of of

766
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,260
above very close to and

767
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:20,470
in you really had three simple alphabet because in a way what you had was

768
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,990
a blank at the end of the programme saying this is what the program

769
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:28,730
but you see if you have three simple alphabet which is zero one in blind

770
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,700
you really are not using the blank

771
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,910
now if you just have it at the end of the programme you really want

772
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:36,930
about one-third you know to to use

773
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,900
all the bits you want zeros and ones to be clear likely and if you

774
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,160
have a black you should have blanked care about a third of the time

775
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,870
you see your really cheating

776
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,160
when you add a third symbol

777
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,960
so if you want to eliminate the blank have only two symbols instead of three

778
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,820
then there's the question of how you can tell when the program not when it

779
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:58,670
stops running but syntactically where the program ends

780
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:00,590
you know whether this stuff

781
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,620
and there's no problem in doing that what you have to have is you have

782
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:06,920
to have a programming language or you could say a universal turing machine

783
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:11,220
which reads a bit by bit the program and decides by itself when i read

784
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:15,100
the last bit without having to read beyond and see that it ran off the

785
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,250
end you know

786
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:19,840
you know they got a blank or the the program is that's that's all the

787
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,890
bits you know and the final condition something and you can do that

788
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:26,290
what you have to do is one of the many ways to do it and

789
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,780
one way to do it is to put the prefix in front of the programme

790
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:31,960
saying how header which is how many bits are

791
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:36,230
coming behind there are many many ways to do it there

792
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,170
infinite number of ways to make programmes of

793
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:43,650
the main thing you do is you just have to decide

794
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,430
the universal turing machine i pick

795
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:50,050
has a live program at the beginning of the prefix

796
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,190
and that parts of the limiting

797
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,320
you know because you just put a special character at the end or or if

798
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,800
you like with the parentheses balance you know where the program and

799
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:02,210
and then after that you have real binary data

800
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:03,590
and the

801
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:09,100
the prefix which is self-limiting indicates how to interpret the raw bits come afterwards

802
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:12,090
and it will have to read them bit by bit and you have to decide

803
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:15,580
by itself and in the prefix you can put any way

804
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,040
there are many possible ways of deciding when

805
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:19,930
you know how many bits the

806
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,920
as you read the bits you know there are many ways of encoding information in

807
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,480
the program

808
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,430
and all of them are equally good

809
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,700
this is the notion of a self-limiting program so when you do that

810
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,660
and the typical and the string is more than and bits

811
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,420
it is how many this will roughly you say ten plus the number of bits

812
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:43,520
you need to specify n

813
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:48,430
in in fact the exact result is that the most ambitious strings need and plus

814
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:51,180
h was order of unity

815
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:55,080
and n is the size in bits of the smallest of the program that calculates

816
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,170
the number and

817
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:00,760
and this is roughly of the order of base two logarithm of n

818
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:04,070
so this is what the number of bits you need to add to the programme

819
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:09,670
to make the programme supplementing to indicate within itself many big program

820
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,690
now this

821
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:14,430
this may look like cheating i mean it may not be clear what you need

822
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:17,320
to do this but there are a lot of reasons for doing this i mean

823
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,420
one reason for doing this is you want

824
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,910
complexity or organic information

825
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:29,670
to be so bad idea in other words you want this to be the case

826
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,070
this is the size in bits of the smallest program that calculates a pair of

827
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:36,430
objects should be bounded in size by

828
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:40,260
the the sum should be bound by the sum of the sizes of the

829
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,690
the individual smaller programs for each of the objects but i can't with the content

830
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,190
is basically do this and do that and then produces result pair

831
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,880
OK so that's a fixed number but this is not the case for nineteen sixties

832
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,690
program size complexity but with learning programs this is the case

833
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:59,450
so you get this program size complexity of this algorithmic information content it is about

834
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:02,360
it which is very natural or you could say additive

835
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,690
i mean you can combine programs

836
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:05,730
you can

837
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:09,490
you can take subroutines and just put them together concatenate bit strings and there's no

838
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,040
problem because

839
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:15,120
each of these subroutines indicates its size so you can then split up the bit

840
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,270
string into some programs without having to add this that's the idea really to be

841
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:21,100
able to build the program from somebody

842
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,130
OK so this is a key factor

843
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,660
another key fact

844
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:28,170
is that with this you can define the whole probability omega which i haven't done

845
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:32,190
yet with programs you can define it with this approach

846
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:37,040
so in my belief in the nineteen sixties definition of program size complexity is just

847
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,090
wrong or

848
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:43,740
you know it was a mistake it was it was a good first attempt

849
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,240
it was OK but i think the best thing to do is forget about it

850
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,150
completely thrown in the garbage forget about that some of the people who work in

851
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:54,460
my field do not share my view

852
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,160
and they like to for example they like lead to technical questions so there is

853
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,710
some good people now

854
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,890
what are the names right down the

855
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:07,020
in new zealand as someone

856
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,130
he is the co-author of the book

857
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,730
which is a highly technical book and one of the things they love to do

858
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:16,260
because they need problems to work on this is to compare the nineteen sixties

859
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:21,160
definition of computer program complexity with the nineteen seventy definition and

860
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:25,580
this gives you no homework is given the mathematical exercises problems to work on and

861
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:30,080
they can prove theorems but i basically considered the it's a mistake and you should

862
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:34,950
just forget about this it was a mistake to find this OK now

863
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,930
i think it's fair to say that lane eleven sort of had this idea of

864
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:40,080
self-limiting two

865
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,950
roughly at the same time that time but he did miss out on

866
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,980
this is not enough there are more correct and you have to make the theory

867
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,690
so let me tell you about

868
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:52,490
there is a notion of relative complexity

869
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:56,420
so this is the size in bits of the smallest program to calculate actually if

870
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,600
you're given y for free

871
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,920
this is an important notion in this theory that i haven't mentioned the now

872
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:06,430
now that the

873
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,000
but no i do what i said in words

874
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,940
by the way use h because h is used by shannon

875
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,330
you know in shannon information theory

876
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:20,110
and i like to use the same age but interpretation is different because

877
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,280
he's talking about ensembles and all kinds of stuff and i'm talking about the size

878
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,130
of a small bits of the smallest program so the notation is the same but

879
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:33,740
the the interpretation of different so the this relative complexity what is the right definition

880
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,080
about complexity

881
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:37,940
OK it's the first of all i will be the size in bits of the

882
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:42,140
smallest supplement program to calculate x if you're given y for free

883
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:46,320
so long

884
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,410
for his

885
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:35,430
o thing

886
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:39,080
and so on

887
01:03:53,170 --> 01:04:09,130
my that

888
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:19,980
so far

889
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:23,000
point that could be generated by the distribution

890
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:25,750
you don't see the point which is

891
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,000
in our case

892
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,300
time some cluster labels

893
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:33,420
the the data and then you change in the world

894
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,520
i'm very unlikely to be the core of the clustering but then you changed

895
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:43,280
and in such a way that

896
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:46,210
it's more likely to create

897
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:48,110
to improve

898
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:50,230
but you can actually make it worse

899
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,090
however the you'll

900
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:57,420
the probability that to improve what we already have is higher than the probably destroyed

901
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:02,900
and then you keep doing this random the too small changes to what you heard

902
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,550
o thousand pounds of

903
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,170
and then eventually you

904
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:11,380
look at

905
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:15,520
the final cycles and get a and

906
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,440
the samples the pain

907
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,920
later in the distribution and the independence of the not independent samples so you have

908
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,300
to actually take them you can take them all you have to take this to

909
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:29,170
the board but eventually to get samples from the true distribution and then you can

910
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:32,050
compute averages and do other things

911
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:37,070
and in particular it may happen if you're lucky in that you're not going to

912
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:41,520
converge and instead of going all over the place they will stay in small neighborhood

913
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:46,270
and so that will be probably closer to what they call the two

914
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:53,610
so this is this is that there are other methods of doing markov chain monte

915
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,630
carlo markov chain is that you

916
01:05:55,730 --> 01:06:00,040
changing your changes from the previous sample to the next

917
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:06,090
so not growing independence of this particular one is called gibbs sampling

918
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:07,820
i like it on the

919
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:11,130
so how do do it in the case of judicial mixtures

920
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:17,520
it is incredible but people who actually fit additional mixture state it works

921
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:20,280
actually they recover true parameters

922
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:23,550
so it's not as hopeless as you may think

923
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:26,340
so these are the power input of

924
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,710
that's good

925
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:30,520
you have to have state the state is that

926
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:33,150
the description of the current current sample data

927
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:38,210
and that is the cluster assignment for every point you have a cluster label

928
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:41,170
and for the cluster parameters

929
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:46,070
i hope this for the images rather sloppy notation because the positive labels may not

930
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:49,650
always be one two three two k that does this thing numbers

931
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:53,340
and you see why because some clusters disappeared sunglasses disappear

932
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,190
so the class label on make

933
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:58,130
i don't have

934
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:02,460
and the patient goes into space and you can think of it is very similar

935
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,190
to to the surface of the year award more of the k means algorithm one

936
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:07,270
step is to

937
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:12,710
reassigned the labels and other historians find the parameters

938
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:15,730
and then you

939
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:18,070
so yes and the labels

940
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:20,300
you think it's pointing to

941
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:25,610
and this is the point is clinical sort of all utilities cluster because you're going

942
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:27,610
to create a new

943
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:40,420
anyway with a single point or you use the cluster labels based on this

944
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,570
so before so it can go to any clustering

945
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:47,500
probably to large cluster with high probability to larger

946
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:51,210
or can we create a new cluster of

947
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:55,960
note that in this formula the

948
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,170
depends are i

949
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:05,230
the former number one equation and the probability of sampling

950
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:07,420
OK dependent i

951
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,920
here it doesn't matter which i is already

952
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,170
alright i is equal to

953
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:13,880
because sample based on

954
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,820
on the end points

955
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:22,840
when you resample the clusters

956
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:27,250
and then you will be something gives us a new cluster so if you don't

957
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:31,020
the point in already existing cluster that to create a new

958
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:32,690
so we have to sample the thing

959
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,840
from the function

960
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,860
this is from the edges

961
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,770
the second

962
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:44,500
one is that we have a new label for class

963
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,270
forty point

964
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,270
this can this can happen to be told about

965
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:51,000
it is not guaranteed

966
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,040
the will result is at least half gamma

967
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:57,690
and what does this mean in words

968
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:01,360
it's saying that when we take the max over

969
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:08,090
columns distribution it's saying that there exists a distribution over the columns or equivalently over

970
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:10,340
weak classifiers

971
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:15,620
so that you we have the mean over examples xi so that for every example

972
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:20,190
x i y i corresponding to a row of the the matrix

973
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,260
this loss will be at least half plus gamma so this loss

974
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:28,810
if we translate it based on our definition of the matrix this loss is the

975
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:33,660
when the column j is chosen according to q

976
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:38,610
of choosing weak classifier which correctly classifies that example

977
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:43,730
so what does this mean it saying that there's the distribution over weak classifiers

978
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:44,770
so that

979
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:50,540
at least half hapless gamma of those weak classifiers as weighted by the distribution q

980
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,830
correctly classify every training example

981
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:59,290
it's saying that there exists in other words there exists a weighted majority vote

982
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:01,140
of the weak classifiers

983
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:04,570
which correctly classifies all of the examples

984
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:06,430
and in fact because

985
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:11,710
aleister hapless game of them are correct that actually means that the marginal blps two

986
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:17,240
OK so summarizing this

987
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,660
but we argue here

988
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:23,320
is that the gamma weak learning assumption is equivalent to the value of the game

989
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:28,290
you know minmax equals marksman being at least the hapless gamma

990
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:33,320
and that in turn is equivalent to every example every training example being

991
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:35,690
correctly classified

992
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:38,310
with some positive margin ips

993
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:43,450
some positive margin by some weighted majority classifier

994
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,400
so it's saying that

995
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:48,390
the weak learning assumption because of game theory

996
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:53,160
not because of anything approved before but because of the fundamental results of game theory

997
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:57,330
the weak learning assumption says that boosting should in principle

998
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:01,150
the possible it should be possible for their press to be able to find this

999
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:06,590
weighted majority classifier which correctly classifies all of the training examples

1000
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:13,180
and what's more the weights the majority vote classifier not arbitrary the weights are actually

1001
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:19,230
a maxmin strategy for this game they're not arbitrary their particular yes

1002
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:30,330
close to what equilibrium OIC i

1003
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:34,640
i you yes i didn't get there you bathe that's what it's going to show

1004
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:35,330
so the

1005
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:40,000
yes so these minmax maxmin are the same as the nash equilibrium

1006
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,030
because it's a zero-sum game

1007
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:46,420
OK so

1008
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:51,740
the idea then for boosting is to try to find this maxmin strategy using the

1009
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:58,280
general algorithm designed for general games in one which has the property that it will

1010
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:02,900
find the maximum strategy by playing the game repeatedly

1011
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:07,840
OK so we can use the general repeated game-playing algorithm

1012
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:13,170
for finding this maxmin strategy and that's really what adaboost is doing

1013
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:18,800
so adaboost is actually a special case of the more general algorithm for playing repeated

1014
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:24,230
games and it has the property that it will converge to the maximum strategy

1015
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:28,750
to see how the boosting process is repeated play of this game

1016
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:34,280
so what's happening in boosting on every round booster chooses the distribution over examples

1017
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:37,320
and the weak learner chooses the weak classifiers

1018
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:43,560
and now we cluster should have high accuracy with respect to the distribution dt

1019
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:47,510
so we can view that playing this game repeatedly

1020
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:48,960
right because

1021
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:53,850
the boosters using this distribution over examples but that's the same as choosing the distribution

1022
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:57,250
over the rows of the matrix because the rows of the matrix are the same

1023
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,750
as the examples

1024
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:04,420
and the weak learner chooses the weak classifiers but that's the same as choosing the

1025
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,200
column of this matrix

1026
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:11,340
and the column can be viewed itself as a distribution over the columns the distribution

1027
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,120
which is

1028
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:14,840
pure which is concentrated on just a single

1029
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:17,520
column of the matrix

1030
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:18,960
and what's more

1031
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:24,020
finding the weak classifier with high accuracy with respect to dt is the same as

1032
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:25,710
trying to find

1033
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:32,710
weak classifier distribution qt with high loss for the row player

1034
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:36,000
which is the goal of the column player

1035
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:40,920
so the point is that the booster the weak learner really playing this game repeatedly

1036
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:43,810
and this turns out to be a special case and i can explain this part

1037
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:47,280
but this turns out to be a special case of the more general algorithm for

1038
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:52,200
playing repeated games and it can be shown in general that if you look at

1039
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:57,150
the average of the peet's that are played by this algorithm in general not just

1040
01:13:57,150 --> 01:14:01,710
for boosting but in general the average of the pcts will converge

1041
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:06,120
two an approximate minmax strategy for the game

1042
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:11,440
being played and likewise the average of the cuties converges to maximin strategy

1043
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,520
so this algorithm in general

1044
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:16,500
finds maxmin strategies and that's exactly what

1045
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:21,790
adaboost is doing which is a special case of this algorithm

1046
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:27,010
OK so to summarise this so the weak learning assumption what we've shown is that

1047
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:30,540
the weak learning assumption implies that the maximum strategy

1048
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:34,670
the rest combinations covering not certified satisfies this

1049
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,930
setting here know

1050
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:37,910
comm can compute is

1051
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:40,070
entries here then we compute

1052
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,870
the optimal coefficients and was that

1053
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,390
we can actually can't repair

1054
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,910
the combination technique same example of before

1055
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,980
ten to the minus sixty on the right

1056
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,320
the graph here before

1057
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:59,430
this graph we know that was optimised commission so this is the least square error

1058
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:00,940
which goes down all the way

1059
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,080
the function of the reason

1060
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:05,100
situated at some point

1061
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,740
so this way

1062
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:13,020
was optimise commissioning which is a bit more competition effort to compute is

1063
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:17,170
scalar product small but it's not too bad it's not

1064
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:20,260
but too much more

1065
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,960
it really does depend on the number of dimensions

1066
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,320
we can now repairs that

1067
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:29,050
and now we compare with some

1068
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:33,860
other approaches for regression using benchmarks but by some other guys

1069
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:37,010
i'm going to read it's experiments

1070
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:39,060
this is now

1071
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:45,470
they don't mind if and regression examples needed could do six he has this really

1072
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:51,340
couldn't because of too high too many dimensions or to many categorical variables

1073
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:55,770
so these are the results of all methods

1074
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:58,470
this is the best of the results in this the the ranking of our method

1075
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:59,880
and we can see

1076
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:04,170
over the mean when for cases where the best

1077
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:07,790
although these nine or ten methods two other cases we still

1078
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,750
doing quite good

1079
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,080
and even again this only a very small datasets only about eight cells

1080
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:23,160
so i was really sings that for more data it's more suited but even for

1081
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,130
the small datasets but quite

1082
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:29,650
and if you look it's

1083
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:34,200
one hundred thousand datapoints synthetic datasets

1084
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:37,230
usual friedman examples

1085
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:39,970
we can also see that we're doing

1086
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:46,070
so we compared against used the best for them on this dataset used masterly

1087
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:50,500
and we can see OK let's first look at these two that we do

1088
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:55,050
the same as as we have much less time or better than SVM

1089
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:57,680
always better than mars

1090
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,400
what's the freedman one

1091
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:04,710
this example has the status that has ten dimensions five of these are noise

1092
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:10,320
obviously we get a bit disturbed by noise could do doing better than the others

1093
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:16,230
if we constrain ourselves using only five non noise variables we can do better

1094
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:20,120
there is no

1095
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:22,300
what we're working on now

1096
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:24,170
is to find ways

1097
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:28,340
automatically detect

1098
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:31,940
this kind of studies that we've always have this

1099
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:35,460
so that's

1100
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:38,330
some of the things i will talk bit later on

1101
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:42,830
what also trying to do is use it for semi supervised learning

1102
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:48,820
that we had that anybody talk about before summer school anybody you heard about semi

1103
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:51,170
supervised learning

1104
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:56,120
so that was semisupervised learning is that

1105
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:59,140
besides using as before all the

1106
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:00,540
data points where we have

1107
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,700
data label

1108
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:06,420
also try to use the information of the unlabelled data as well

1109
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:11,690
the different different approaches to that one approach is to use it

1110
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:14,650
dramatic distribution of the data coming from

1111
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:17,150
o thing ideas for money for learning

1112
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,030
one one ejected from some

1113
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:23,480
other guises

1114
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:26,110
OK if you only answers to labelled data

1115
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,420
promising OK

1116
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,470
this is probably quite

1117
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:33,550
class boundary but if you have the unlabelled data as well

1118
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:35,280
it's much more obvious

1119
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:39,430
class but probably should for look something like this

1120
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:42,370
two groups working on that

1121
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:47,940
we essentially picked up to approach from back in you

1122
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:56,310
it was a use ideas from manifold learning

1123
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:00,660
two at the national organization come to the setting

1124
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:02,780
OK so

1125
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:07,700
very short manifold learning thirty years says that you have some

1126
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:18,550
yes you that you want to have a three-dimensional

1127
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:24,010
but you assume that the data lies on submanifold you want

1128
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,910
find some something wonderful

1129
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,310
a couple of days

1130
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:34,240
it's also known as the nonlinear dimension reduction

1131
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:39,000
manifold learning so a lot of others in the last couple of years isomap locally

1132
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,070
linear embedding depression i'm obsession

1133
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:44,890
and so on

1134
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:46,860
they essentially

1135
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,780
a similar things so the

1136
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:53,150
computer neighborhood the input space can nearest neighbors or something like that

1137
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:57,870
matrix based on

1138
01:19:57,890 --> 01:20:00,250
the the differences in this part

1139
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:03,710
how to from this neighborhood how to come to this

1140
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:09,940
matrix was which represents is these membership relations of the distances between the different points

1141
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:14,300
then make betting we have the top or bottom i values

1142
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,600
they also can be viewed as

1143
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:20,920
kernel PCA

1144
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,820
one way to

1145
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,930
use it for money for semi supervised learning

1146
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:30,290
is too

1147
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,520
the normal setting before

1148
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:35,110
well we just

1149
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:40,790
and intrinsic regulation terms which should describe the data distribution

1150
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:45,140
so this this way was also proposed by picking u

1151
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,930
and they also can show that this is again an refusing kind space

1152
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:51,590
some other works by the people japan consumed

1153
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:52,570
for example

1154
01:20:54,370 --> 01:21:00,570
but in a different way but using also manifold learning ideas

1155
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:11,690
it's essentially the same trend extrapolation german we want to

1156
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:19,270
plus you know the manifold authorization approximates

1157
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:24,600
these relations so there's a senior

1158
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:29,590
function relies of this you see these are the edge which operates on the data

1159
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:33,400
into is the graph so we take our nearest neighbour so we have to be

1160
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:39,240
the adjacency some ways of these constructs are binary distance so he

1161
01:21:40,290 --> 01:21:41,970
so you

1162
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:45,040
approximate system for this

1163
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:46,350
and then you can

1164
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:51,110
prior is the graph laplacian so if the graph laplacian which is

1165
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:54,720
he was w just some

1166
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,660
user biometrics was the sum of

1167
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:00,190
he graduated from

1168
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,110
want to possible for each

1169
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:07,600
this we no introduce into our setting

1170
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:10,040
so again we have two terms before

1171
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,290
and houses

1172
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,450
it is a regularisation to

1173
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:20,690
what is the discrete space

1174
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:24,550
make it linear equation system out of that

1175
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:34,660
well so i will continue the curvature announced kaesong of

1176
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:41,440
days in kernels because one of the ways

1177
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:42,880
you can

1178
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:50,200
and i'm the going to focus on the idea is that there is this which

1179
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,360
so here we are in the family

1180
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:56,420
you can also try to find by a disease

1181
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:03,340
just a combination so that can in some of the

1182
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:07,370
features or strings there is

1183
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:11,480
there is no way to make

1184
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:15,490
just space by making it by looking

1185
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:17,380
so fast

1186
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:23,460
example of this is feature space he's not thinking here using dictionaries which is there

1187
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:24,660
is no one

1188
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:27,260
this processing

1189
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:34,200
i also illustrate the for protein sequences so here it is kind of similar to

1190
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:38,470
to camera is actually use can use

1191
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:39,790
on the day

1192
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:48,170
we some parameters following may just space make feature film five peace

1193
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,400
you choose dictionary

1194
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:57,660
of sequences of these in the case of of data OK that you will use

1195
01:23:57,660 --> 01:24:01,050
the consequences for some reason was

1196
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:08,420
what does this article in the dictionary is a dictionary of for sequences and this

1197
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:14,640
then you should measure of similarity so you also can because the image of p

1198
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,950
and this is a new tool

1199
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:20,420
to describe what your statement is OWL

1200
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:26,250
the world is very prime so this could be sworn by using

1201
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:30,810
he is be the with suppose

1202
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:35,750
when you string fuzzy and what she really that kind of thing

1203
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:39,430
five is in the expeditionary

1204
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:42,400
or was actually that day by waltz

1205
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:48,240
that correspond to the image in your stream is there was the dictionary

1206
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:53,370
so it is natural that should because from this it has been used in different

1207
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:55,740
ways the first one

1208
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:56,440
my biography

1209
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:59,250
caucus was something called the motor control

1210
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:03,000
so the common that by committees we know that

1211
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:09,930
we we have something called lot these which typically corresponds to so many that can

1212
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:17,090
have different definitions of history and there's not many things but he is this short

1213
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:19,750
sequences that some function of the structure

1214
01:25:19,810 --> 01:25:25,320
so there are different ways of monkeys and be natural way to transform

1215
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:31,280
as protein sequences into vector is to take a database of these

1216
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:38,250
and to assist with which is present in a string of impressive scoring so you

1217
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,430
have one thousand images

1218
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:42,850
then you can check whether each of the one thousand

1219
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:47,060
is not is on is in the place on all or part of the corpus

1220
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:51,250
christi can score which was a sequence and this

1221
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,810
the sequence by the sets of scores dictionary

1222
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:58,870
which is a bit related to what you get us on

1223
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:04,100
i measure between strings is to take a dictionary

1224
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:12,930
so far away but been used pudong is taken training sets so here is that

1225
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:13,940
is the

1226
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,400
is it really so will

1227
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:23,810
a nationally prominent for a set of n sequences

1228
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:26,810
and in fact use these sequences as dictionary

1229
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:29,370
so as to indicate the rest

1230
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:34,020
of strings and you assume that for some reason you have some measure of similarity

1231
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:37,000
between strings this could be

1232
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:39,190
as mentioned earlier

1233
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:40,810
what are you

1234
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:43,820
and then you're represent each sequence

1235
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:48,850
your training sets and also to the set of tall similarities

1236
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,710
the same thing being computed for background

1237
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:55,960
so by using these we are the strings in the training set

1238
01:26:55,990 --> 01:27:01,060
OK so here for the training set as purposes easier both for training and machine

1239
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:03,980
learning libraries and it is also

1240
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:07,350
the representation use

1241
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:12,420
so it was because when you would have to classify new history that is not

1242
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:15,190
training set the history can be

1243
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:18,520
to this because you region

1244
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:20,870
princess so you can point your finger

1245
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,630
the symmetry we all

1246
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:25,830
princess and then apply much here

1247
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:32,320
so there is no longer just just mentioned because it is common useful commonly used

1248
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:35,920
sometimes called the account

1249
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:38,770
so there are some

1250
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:44,490
so different positions behind but this is using is going play with us

1251
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:49,370
visual similarity is not positive that you want to use as you and i want

1252
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:55,160
to do that just computes matrix similarities but instead of saying that he not the

1253
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:57,620
just symmetrical

1254
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:01,560
and then there can be no peace

1255
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:03,750
thank you transfer the

1256
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,730
between your toes and these deposits the

1257
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:14,000
because it is convenient to have some measure you can use it to define the

1258
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,520
vector of features

1259
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:21,250
and then use the central position make machine

1260
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:25,390
OK so these few examples of explicit

1261
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:32,820
future vision for strings and move on to to family of approaches that be more

1262
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:39,100
interesting terms of mathematics vols and interesting because they make use of

1263
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:41,980
things we have seen about the policy but you are

1264
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,450
question is supposed to be model streams how can make anything between just modelling good

1265
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:49,290
of good kernels

1266
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:57,750
so what we call in this these methods we use the world pretty models what

1267
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:58,920
i mean by a model

1268
01:28:58,930 --> 01:29:03,540
it is the sum of those in the family of distributions so typically approach the

1269
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:09,310
family of distributions p what done is assumed to be a finite dimensional vector of

1270
01:29:10,330 --> 01:29:15,730
and for instance of the features on then you use for and by the way

1271
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:18,490
is already become models that we saw now

1272
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:24,800
i think statistical models so here we assume that someone has been able to design

1273
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:26,440
a probability model

1274
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:32,430
bans on any parameters we call that benefit parameters and the question is can we

1275
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:34,120
use the model

1276
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:35,730
to make it clear

1277
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:42,460
so this singles but not to mention the markov models full strings in committees when

1278
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:47,290
you focus on RNA processing there's something called stochastic on the graphs that have been

1279
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:48,310
used a lot

1280
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:51,500
and which also for ontology can use tools

1281
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,960
two to make better

1282
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:56,500
so what can you do when you have such a model of what is the

1283
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,600
link between these and the possibility to make the kernel

1284
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:02,290
i would describe it here three

1285
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:10,120
three can also be protocols that allow you to derive positive can from your so

1286
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:13,080
called so historically the first one

1287
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,760
which is probably the

1288
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:17,070
the most difficult

1289
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:21,660
two is it justified but which is a convenient is the official journal

1290
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:25,740
it was but i think it was the already by the nineteen ninety eight by

1291
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:27,110
jacqueline house

1292
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,880
the for

1293
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:32,980
but the thing is between i mean it just model but it is it we

1294
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:37,610
tried explicit features so it could be related to the various approaches to to mention

1295
01:30:37,610 --> 01:30:43,260
how many features anything on this three which is also when you suppose to use

1296
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:47,830
it and then you know that you can follow strings of different things

1297
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:49,210
OK so this is the right

1298
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:53,450
they want to represent a by a factor of essential

1299
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:56,200
the importance weight

1300
01:30:56,270 --> 01:31:00,490
you look at the expression of the importance weight

1301
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:06,250
so what you see here is that remember in the previous case in the second

1302
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:11,310
but something case you i was in the case where the importance sampling time and

1303
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:17,110
was importance sampling at time n minus one times this quantity

1304
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,890
because of some examples

1305
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:23,620
previously according

1306
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:32,230
to the weighted sum of weighted empirical measure the new particle approximately distributed

1307
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:37,310
according to p x one given y one so i don't need to have this

1308
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:38,810
tell me more

1309
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:43,300
and this is simply from the fact because if you sample at time n minus

1310
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:49,560
one then you particle approximately distributed according to the target was stereo ten minus one

1311
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:54,610
so in the explosion of the weight you don't have the weight importance sampling weight

1312
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:55,980
at time n minus one

1313
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:58,730
any more just have to compute these k

1314
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:02,920
you we normalize the guy on the

1315
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:04,820
some again

1316
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:08,550
so very very simple algorithm

1317
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:10,770
any question at this stage

1318
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:14,820
OK so

1319
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:19,960
so what is possible

1320
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:27,320
so this is a graph where trying to illustrate the second but importance sampling resampling

1321
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:31,000
o particles in right

1322
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:35,570
i assume you start time

1323
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:39,010
instead of time on the document to the court of

1324
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:41,590
so at times are all your examples today

1325
01:32:41,610 --> 01:32:43,070
you sample

1326
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:51,480
articles OK so this is x not one x two x three x four c

1327
01:32:56,170 --> 01:33:00,480
that time when you've got the poles of salvation y one k

1328
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:04,280
and the idea of salvation while

1329
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:09,340
he's basically you're going to put in the case where essentially e

1330
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:14,220
x is close to y then g of y given x is large so for

1331
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:18,990
example you could be in the case where y is equal to explore some gaussian

1332
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:26,210
noise so that essentially the g of y given x is gaussian mean x y

1333
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:27,870
and z one

1334
01:33:29,310 --> 01:33:33,230
you've got to particles at time one OK

1335
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:36,300
and they all have wait

1336
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:39,230
so one two three four

1337
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,770
on you sample

1338
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:42,820
from the

1339
01:33:42,850 --> 01:33:47,030
distribution of these particles OK i'm basically

1340
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:49,140
the bigger the size of the dot

1341
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:55,570
the most likely you're going to get many offsprings OK so in these cases where

1342
01:33:55,980 --> 01:34:00,350
you not very lucky say on despite the fact that these particle as it doesn't

1343
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:03,510
have to we evaluate your we sampled two

1344
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:04,840
o springs

1345
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:09,220
in this dislocation these particles as wonka p

1346
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:14,420
this because has what he here OK

1347
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:19,340
if you evaluate NASA this is the resampled particles

1348
01:34:19,370 --> 01:34:24,240
now you evaluate essentially the likelihood of this new

1349
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:30,250
OK so basically this one because it's very close to the salvation

1350
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:31,580
it doesn't very

1351
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,620
essentially a potential

1352
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:38,300
so so this thing i weight whereas those guy that kind of a region of

1353
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:41,800
low quality mass so they have lower

1354
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:44,200
so for example four times

1355
01:34:44,210 --> 01:34:46,420
from the empirical measure of

1356
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:49,500
of these four particles

1357
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,880
we this guy being

1358
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:56,360
large weight this once more like this one which is one small weight you resample

1359
01:34:56,380 --> 01:35:00,140
and that's that you're one small quite unlucky because this guy

1360
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:04,980
as tools supporting this one despite having a low weight as one as bring on

1361
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:06,660
this one as is well offspring

1362
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:12,500
OK so despite the fact that this algorithm is doing quite but actually not because

1363
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:17,750
it doesn't always on william good original space still don't really you don't you don't

1364
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,630
lose talk

1365
01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:23,590
of the of the white regions so policy full OK so these guys going to

1366
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:28,450
very lightweight this one no lo and at this stage it eventually always something is

1367
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:34,610
doing something quite sensible each every three copies into i probability mass this one makes

1368
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:37,910
it situated at the very simple reason so

1369
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:39,390
you move from

1370
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:43,140
if you look at your weight it you essentially all close you are from the

1371
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:47,750
tallest on you if you in the white region you have a chance to have

1372
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:50,560
multiple copies otherwise you die

1373
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:52,990
this very simple

1374
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:55,800
so i'm going to forget about that

1375
01:35:55,810 --> 01:35:57,830
what if could mention

1376
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:03,270
is that in practice you're not need to at each iteration the only time you

1377
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:09,150
need to resamples is when the effective sample size is getting below a given threshold

1378
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:10,590
OK so

1379
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:13,220
be able to borrow information

1380
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,290
across users i need

1381
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:18,840
that singular vectors be spread because if they are not spread

1382
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,330
there's nothing i can do

1383
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:25,000
we need to be be able to see all the entries in that column or

1384
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:26,390
in that row

1385
01:36:26,410 --> 01:36:30,620
so for example if you look at the netflix database they are actually few users

1386
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:32,700
that are completely orthogonal

1387
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:36,440
to everybody else and there are few movies are completely outside the body for example

1388
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:38,400
that napoleon dynamite

1389
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:41,220
it's a good example of the movie that is orthogonal because people don't know what

1390
01:36:41,220 --> 01:36:44,420
to think of it so you have this problem

1391
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,500
you have people who really like movies and the like it and all the others

1392
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:49,240
on what you think

1393
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:52,100
OK so to kind of

1394
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,610
make this notion a bits

1395
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:04,170
we can kind of introduce the notion of coherence which is a very simple notion

1396
01:37:04,170 --> 01:37:09,130
so you give me a subspace of rn of dimension are which is presented here

1397
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:13,100
we're gonna look at PU which is the projection onto is that subspace

1398
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:18,080
and so we can define the coherence of the subspace of is the canonical basis

1399
01:37:18,330 --> 01:37:21,550
as i'm taking the inner product the

1400
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:25,950
canonical basis i project them onto the space and i'm looking at the size of

1401
01:37:25,950 --> 01:37:27,000
this projection

1402
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:31,180
and i'm just going to renormalize this by the dimension of the ambient space divided

1403
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:33,840
by the space of our

1404
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:37,690
OK so that's essentially the definition of the coherence of you and we have again

1405
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:43,170
like yesterday was the coherence in compressed sensing we have two extreme cases the maximum

1406
01:37:43,170 --> 01:37:48,210
value of the coherence is achieved when you contains one of these basis vectors in

1407
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:50,810
which case the projection is one in which case

1408
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:53,950
the coherence is an overall

1409
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:55,890
the other extreme case

1410
01:37:55,910 --> 01:38:01,910
it is one in this subspace i can find an orthonormal basis such that the

1411
01:38:01,930 --> 01:38:05,330
the basis elements extremely spread out

1412
01:38:06,350 --> 01:38:10,500
and so if i can find the basis of that subspace such that this is

1413
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:13,390
the maximum entry of the vector UK

1414
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:16,540
is of size one of his code and since they have to the l two

1415
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:17,930
norm has to be one

1416
01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:19,770
then in that case the coherence

1417
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:22,250
is minimum and is equal to one

1418
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:26,190
so when we see that when you is aligned with the basis vectors coherence is

1419
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:30,870
and when you is kind of orthogonal to this kind of basis vectors then the

1420
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:32,410
coherence is low

1421
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:35,870
and if you take a random plane if you select the plane at random of

1422
01:38:35,870 --> 01:38:40,660
dimension are then with very high probability is the coherence will be very low it

1423
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:43,580
will be actually order one

1424
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:45,270
OK alright so

1425
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:48,160
so the first result i want to present is what can we do and what

1426
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:51,500
can we do not do so what is information theoretically possible

1427
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:55,580
so give me a matrix i'm going to introduce mu not which is the maximum

1428
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:59,660
between the coherence of the column space in the row space and we've seen that

1429
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:02,770
is the columns case centre was based on highly coherent

1430
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:03,710
we is

1431
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:07,890
the basis vectors then matrix completion is not possible

1432
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:11,390
and the first result completely formalized these results

1433
01:39:11,390 --> 01:39:13,430
this intuition it said that

1434
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:19,500
no method whatsoever can complete matrices on less as the number of samples that you

1435
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:23,730
get to see is greater than the coherence

1436
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:27,390
times the number of degrees of freedom which is the dimension time the rank

1437
01:39:27,410 --> 01:39:29,270
times the luck factor

1438
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:34,190
OK so this is telling you where e is the fundamental limits of recovery said

1439
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:38,250
it depends on the number of degrees of freedom we've seen that matrix of rank

1440
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:42,080
r depends on about two times and times of degrees of freedom and so what

1441
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:46,800
this thing says if you take a number of measurements which is ignoring log factors

1442
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:51,600
smaller than coherence time number of degrees of freedom there's nothing you can do

1443
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:55,270
you can now complete the matrix

1444
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:57,890
OK so we're going to be interested in

1445
01:39:57,910 --> 01:39:59,980
matrices with low coherence

1446
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,020
such that the coherence order one so roughly speaking would be interested in matrices who

1447
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:08,460
principal components are spread

1448
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:12,230
and this log n factor comes in from

1449
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:15,460
comes from the coupon collector problem it's to q

1450
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:19,250
all right so

1451
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:25,410
roughly speaking is the coherence is one order one then no method whatsoever can succeed

1452
01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:28,350
if unless the number of samples exceeds

1453
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:31,730
the degrees of freedom times logan

1454
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:33,770
OK so now

1455
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:36,480
i want to show you kind of the positive result now

1456
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:39,080
so we see and what we cannot do and then what is it that we

1457
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:40,450
can do

1458
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:44,660
so i see very few entries that's a point one percent of the entries of

1459
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:50,390
the large matrix i'm going to try to guess the rest by nuclear norm minimisation

1460
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:51,330
and so

1461
01:40:51,350 --> 01:40:55,580
we cannot just assumes what assume what we've

1462
01:40:56,290 --> 01:41:00,730
what we've talked about we can assume that the singular vectors of the unknown matrix

1463
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:02,270
m are spread

1464
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:05,960
that is that their are top magnitude is of size one of the square root

1465
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:10,390
of the respective dimensions and we can assume that the rank is small of order

1466
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:15,560
now i'm getting two psi show you a set of size and that i selected

1467
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:16,660
at random

1468
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,930
you'd like to get the rest how do you do it

1469
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:22,890
you minimize defined as matrix that is consistent with what you've seen

1470
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:24,930
the has minimum nuclear norm

1471
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:29,750
again the results we have we stand is this

1472
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:34,230
it said that surprisingly these works and his works extremely well

1473
01:41:34,290 --> 01:41:37,890
and the price the result is is that first of all the minimizer to this

1474
01:41:37,890 --> 01:41:39,850
optimisation problem is unique

1475
01:41:39,870 --> 01:41:42,450
and will be exactly equal to

1476
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:44,460
the matrix that you're interested in

1477
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:48,330
with very high probability as long as the number of samples

1478
01:41:48,350 --> 01:41:53,450
these figures and the dimension of the matrix ten logan square so i'm showing you

1479
01:41:53,450 --> 01:41:56,830
cannot do since the rank is of order one you cannot do better than n

1480
01:41:56,850 --> 01:42:00,480
log n and all what loses compared to this

1481
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:05,500
optimal result is perhaps a lot factors that may be we've been sloppy and we

1482
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:06,640
can improve

1483
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:10,500
and so what he says is as soon as matrix recovery is possible by any

1484
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:16,180
method whatsoever it is possible by semidefinite programming

1485
01:42:16,850 --> 01:42:20,350
now the problem there is the probability of success because of course we have to

1486
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:26,540
account for his adversarial sampling sets so here i set the probability of failure arbitrary

1487
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:27,810
two n minus

1488
01:42:27,810 --> 01:42:31,500
one of n q this could become one of and to the one hundred if

1489
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,730
you wanted to

1490
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:37,540
provided that in the constant you multiply by one hundred so if you want to

1491
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:41,520
probability of essentially one or and to the one hundred and you need to see

1492
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,850
a hundred times and logan square examples

1493
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:49,660
OK so

1494
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:52,180
interestingly this is connected with is

1495
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:54,290
lots of

1496
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:56,080
the graph problems

1497
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:59,560
so it is connected with the coupon collector problems i think it's a bit of

1498
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:02,390
a simple connection now i'll skip it

1499
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:06,370
let me show you something more interesting so

1500
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:08,950
our results cover lots of stuff

1501
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:13,930
there are no in graph theory and i'll just present one results

1502
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:16,480
if you give me a rank one matrix

1503
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:18,480
it is known

1504
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,280
because i could never grown a mustache

1505
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:23,150
this is like eight days growth

1506
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:26,800
so i'm glad i'm not edwardian have

1507
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:31,620
and as i mentioned already that

1508
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:38,210
this debate is really about computing numbers and really mad mathematical statistics is is the world

1509
01:43:38,610 --> 01:43:39,730
we are interested in it

1510
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:45,060
so machine learning and probability with probability coming into machine learning where the world is

1511
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:48,010
an uncertain place for example i got up today

1512
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:50,570
expecting to sit quietly in the audience

1513
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:56,880
six thousand lectures and you know things happen things change and you need to deal with them

1514
01:43:57,850 --> 01:44:00,950
so epidemic uncertainty is one type of uncertainty

1515
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:03,810
so this uncertainty arising through lack of knowledge

1516
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:08,070
so what colour socks is that person wearing so what colour socks and my wearing

1517
01:44:09,530 --> 01:44:10,050
thank you

1518
01:44:12,260 --> 01:44:16,280
normally works better in england when you're giving lectures in the middle of winter

1519
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:25,490
and then aleatoric uncertainties uncertainty arising through an underlying stochastic system so if i if

1520
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:26,670
i take a sheet a paper hear

1521
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:28,920
and i drop it where will fall

1522
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:30,560
well i could do it

1523
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:34,110
similar way many many times and i wouldn't be able to say

1524
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:39,760
now there two broad categories of uncertainty and here's the really this the right way

1525
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,520
to think about these uncertainties right

1526
01:44:43,870 --> 01:44:45,730
two ways watching a football match right

1527
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:46,990
you watch it live

1528
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:50,060
and that's aleatoric uncertainty

1529
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:52,840
the other one is you can't watch it live

1530
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:54,980
because your work something new

1531
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:58,250
on your video recorder or you all

1532
01:44:58,650 --> 01:44:59,890
sky plus box or whatever

1533
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:03,600
and then you come back later orders on really early in the morning and you

1534
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,000
play as if it was like

1535
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:07,850
now as far as you're concerned

1536
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:10,800
if you don't know the result is a bit spoiled it somewhat

1537
01:45:11,570 --> 01:45:12,220
they want you know

1538
01:45:12,730 --> 01:45:16,130
but as long as you can maintain illusion that you don't know the result the

1539
01:45:16,170 --> 01:45:19,670
uncertainty is the same there is an actual difference and this difference

1540
01:45:20,630 --> 01:45:24,220
it was brought home to me when i was doing this with rugby england versus france

1541
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:26,150
in the world cup the

1542
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,500
semi-final i think it was

1543
01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:30,070
i tried to forget about it

1544
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:35,920
ah we had a really good and quarterfinals it was i think you get the

1545
01:45:35,930 --> 01:45:37,590
semi-final we had an excellent run to the

1546
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:41,650
the team is rubbish but they decide to be france the were looking good and

1547
01:45:41,650 --> 01:45:44,490
i started watching the game and they would just appalling

1548
01:45:45,030 --> 01:45:48,210
and they were down by a certain number of points and i thought i can't

1549
01:45:48,230 --> 01:45:50,300
you know i'm gonna go and check what the final score was

1550
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:54,640
so i left and went and looked obviously you can't do that's a trick you're

1551
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:58,550
watching it live but i was watching recorded so i do not watch a recorded

1552
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:02,640
and that's epistemic uncertainty because i can always go and find out the result is

1553
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:04,050
no i just don't know it

1554
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:05,990
with aleatoric is

1555
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:09,930
the result is on now this is a little overlapping here which is the

1556
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,590
why does this thing drop in

1557
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,600
different ways every time i drop it

1558
01:46:15,230 --> 01:46:20,070
it i assume it's slightly different initial conditions chaos theory

1559
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,950
very small variations in initial conditions

1560
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,590
even in the deterministic system so actually

1561
01:46:27,310 --> 01:46:32,950
ali or i think pretty much unless you get down to the quantum level i understand quantum mechanics

1562
01:46:33,650 --> 01:46:37,730
enough to make a claim about them but let's ignore quantum levels let's just assume

1563
01:46:37,730 --> 01:46:39,540
that this is chaos causing these things

1564
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:46,590
all aleatoric uncertainty in some senses epistemic uncertainty if you knew precisely the initial conditions

1565
01:46:46,590 --> 01:46:49,080
with which i'm dropping it and the state and everything

1566
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:52,410
in the room then we would be able to compute without would land

1567
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:56,250
such small variations effectively make this

1568
01:46:57,810 --> 01:46:59,400
noise aleatoric uncertainty

1569
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:05,460
so le plus this is called the places indeterminism

1570
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:09,540
like the origin have been like awful to take the origin away

1571
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:11,620
why is that

1572
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:14,880
so i need the origin there because

1573
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:18,850
i have to be allowed if i had these other factors

1574
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:22,400
i have to be allowed to multiply three two

1575
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:24,550
this was three two

1576
01:47:24,610 --> 01:47:27,220
by anything by any scalars

1577
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,930
including zero

1578
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:33,280
i'm going to be allowed to multiply by zero and and and and the result

1579
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:37,170
is going to be there i can do without point

1580
01:47:37,220 --> 01:47:40,110
and i have to be able to add three two

1581
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:40,920
o two

1582
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:44,760
then the opposite guy minus three minus two

1583
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:48,290
and if i have those back to the origin

1584
01:47:48,290 --> 01:47:52,930
no way i can do without the origin every vector space has got the zero

1585
01:47:55,390 --> 01:47:58,110
OK that's an easy vector space

1586
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:01,600
because we have a natural picture of it

1587
01:48:01,610 --> 01:48:09,500
OK is similarly easy is our three

1588
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:13,690
this would be all me go up here

1589
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:16,850
this would be

1590
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:20,400
r three would be all

1591
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:24,050
three-dimensional vectors social vectors

1592
01:48:27,580 --> 01:48:33,370
real come home

1593
01:48:34,130 --> 01:48:38,000
let me just just to be sure

1594
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:40,220
we're together

1595
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:44,160
let me take the vector three two zero

1596
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:53,340
is that a vector in r two or r three

1597
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:56,650
definitely is or three

1598
01:48:57,590 --> 01:49:02,040
it's got three components one of them happens to be zero but that's perfectly OK

1599
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:07,380
so that's a vector in r three

1600
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:13,190
we don't we don't mix up the i mean keep these vectors straight and keep

1601
01:49:13,190 --> 01:49:16,350
our hands straight so what's already

1602
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:19,140
are and

1603
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:21,200
so this is our

1604
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:22,670
big example

1605
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:29,780
it's all vectors with and components and i'm making these time things column vectors

1606
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:33,570
can i can i try to follow that convention

1607
01:49:33,610 --> 01:49:37,990
there will be column vectors and their component should be real

1608
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,740
real numbers

1609
01:49:40,790 --> 01:49:45,940
later will need complex numbers and complex factors but much later

1610
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:50,530
OK so that the vector space

1611
01:49:51,110 --> 01:49:57,340
let's see what the what do i have to tell you about vector spaces

1612
01:49:57,380 --> 01:50:02,820
i said the most important thing which is that we can add

1613
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:06,150
any two of these and we still in r two

1614
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:09,490
we can multiply by any number and we're still in our two

1615
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:12,800
you can take any combination and we're still in our two

1616
01:50:12,810 --> 01:50:15,520
and same goes for rn

1617
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:20,330
honesty requires me to mention that this

1618
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:22,760
these operations are adding

1619
01:50:22,810 --> 01:50:26,250
and multiplying have to obey

1620
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:30,410
a few rules like we can just arbitrarily say OK

1621
01:50:30,470 --> 01:50:32,600
the sum of three two and pi

1622
01:50:33,110 --> 01:50:34,700
it is zero zero

1623
01:50:34,740 --> 01:50:35,600
it's not

1624
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:39,240
the sum of three two

1625
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:44,350
and minus three two is zero zero so all i'm not going to be the

1626
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:46,360
book actually

1627
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:49,130
with the eight rules

1628
01:50:49,170 --> 01:50:53,770
that the addition and multiplication have to satisfy but they do

1629
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:59,530
they certainly satisfy in rn and usually it's not those a rules that are in

1630
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:06,140
what's what's what the question is

1631
01:51:06,150 --> 01:51:10,930
and we do that those additions and we stay in this space let me show

1632
01:51:11,970 --> 01:51:14,660
a case where you can't

1633
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:18,030
so suppose this is this is going to be not

1634
01:51:18,030 --> 01:51:22,220
a vector space

1635
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:30,350
suppose i take the x y plane so those are two that is of vectors

1636
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:32,570
now suppose i just take

1637
01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:35,030
part of it

1638
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:36,780
just this

1639
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:40,250
just is what this is one corner

1640
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:43,950
of the vector space

1641
01:51:44,010 --> 01:51:47,500
all the vectors with positive

1642
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:52,150
or at least not negative component

1643
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,810
can i add those

1644
01:51:57,860 --> 01:52:00,190
if i had a vector with

1645
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:01,970
like two three two

1646
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:04,160
another factor like five six

1647
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:06,490
i'm still up in this quarter

1648
01:52:06,490 --> 01:52:08,660
no problem with adding

1649
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:11,100
but there's a problem with

1650
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:16,810
multiplying by scalars because there's a lot of scalars that will

1651
01:52:16,850 --> 01:52:21,350
take me out of this corner points like negative one

1652
01:52:21,410 --> 01:52:27,320
if i took three two and i multiplied by minus five i'm way down here

1653
01:52:27,370 --> 01:52:31,350
so that's not a vector space because it's not

1654
01:52:31,350 --> 01:52:35,800
closed is the right word it's not closed under

1655
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:41,590
all real numbers

1656
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:48,280
so the vector space has to be closed under multiplication and addition of vectors in

1657
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:54,430
other words linear combinations it so it means

1658
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:57,420
that if i give you a few vectors

1659
01:52:57,470 --> 01:53:02,090
look here's an important here now we're getting to some really important vector spaces well

1660
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:03,370
our and

1661
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:06,530
like they are the most important

1662
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:14,780
we will be interested in some in vector spaces that are inside our

1663
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:16,970
vector spaces

1664
01:53:18,090 --> 01:53:20,260
follow the rules

1665
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:23,100
but they we don't need all

1666
01:53:23,110 --> 01:53:24,850
of c there we

1667
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:29,260
we started with our two here

1668
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:31,840
and took part of it

1669
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:34,080
and mister

1670
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:36,460
what we got was not of vector spaces

1671
01:53:36,510 --> 01:53:40,840
now tell me of vector space that is

1672
01:53:40,850 --> 01:53:43,400
part of our two

1673
01:53:43,450 --> 01:53:44,940
and is still

1674
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:49,240
we can multiply we can add and we stay

1675
01:53:50,050 --> 01:53:54,820
in this smaller vector space so it's going to be called a subspace

1676
01:53:54,830 --> 01:54:00,080
so i'm going to change this bad example to good

1677
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:05,680
so i'm going to start again with our two

1678
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:09,590
but i'm going to take an example is a vector space

1679
01:54:09,590 --> 01:54:14,430
so it will be a vector space inside are two

1680
01:54:16,110 --> 01:54:20,030
and i recall that subspace

1681
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:23,760
of our two

1682
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:28,100
OK what can i do

1683
01:54:28,110 --> 01:54:31,050
it's got something in it

1684
01:54:31,050 --> 01:54:33,800
i suppose it's got this vector in

1685
01:54:36,170 --> 01:54:37,590
if that vectors in mind

1686
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:39,520
come from the same distribution

1687
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:44,560
there you have to find so

1688
01:54:44,580 --> 01:54:49,320
a way of looking at that is dynamic is to define a timescale where

1689
01:54:49,330 --> 01:54:55,630
something is preserved and then try to find structure at that time scale

1690
01:54:55,780 --> 01:54:59,570
but you can just take these islands and apply them to the that the changes

1691
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:02,780
because they assume that comes from the same distribution

1692
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,800
if there is any distribution

1693
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:13,560
and in particular here i i believe myself and that the division should be small

1694
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:15,220
so that theoretically the

1695
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:19,010
the prime could have come from the same distribution as me so one way of

1696
01:55:19,010 --> 01:55:20,950
protecting the data is

1697
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:24,660
actually sampling from the data which replaced

1698
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:28,250
then you get the best that contains the same points but maybe if you are

1699
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:30,030
missing and if you are just a few

1700
01:55:31,230 --> 01:55:33,530
repeated one supplies

1701
01:55:33,530 --> 01:55:36,580
and that actually called bootstrap is very

1702
01:55:36,590 --> 01:55:39,440
a widely used technique is statistics

1703
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:42,920
OK so these are dissimilar

1704
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:47,410
we should suspect both because we know that one of them is wrong

1705
01:55:47,470 --> 01:55:50,620
at least one and in five people

1706
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:55,580
well if we repeat this many times and this city over and over again and

1707
01:55:55,580 --> 01:55:58,390
the two clusterings are similar then

1708
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:02,180
maybe there is reason to believe that they have found something that

1709
01:56:02,230 --> 01:56:09,680
especially the more similar only one k and also more valuable different k

1710
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:26,060
so this idea was implemented for every k

1711
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:28,370
we resample the data many times

1712
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:32,620
look how close this clustering

1713
01:56:32,630 --> 01:56:37,160
for this you have to have the distance to measure clustering to talk about this

1714
01:56:38,410 --> 01:56:42,730
and you have actually this clustering because the data descriptor may not contain

1715
01:56:42,810 --> 01:56:45,420
no it it may not be about the same number of points they have to

1716
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:48,620
take only the points that are common to the to the

1717
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:51,850
two clusterings but these are all details

1718
01:56:51,860 --> 01:57:00,060
and in fact they the experiment so that very often what happens is that

1719
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:02,790
for the UK

1720
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:07,450
all the clustering together seem to be similar whereas for other values of k that

1721
01:57:07,450 --> 01:57:11,070
is more much more variation

1722
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:17,160
there is another so this can work for any clustering method provided the hard clusters

1723
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:20,360
because we don't really know how to compare clusterings that

1724
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:27,390
another idea which works

1725
01:57:27,410 --> 01:57:29,210
and has been implemented by

1726
01:57:29,220 --> 01:57:31,920
for model based clustering is the following

1727
01:57:31,940 --> 01:57:35,010
i divided into two halves

1728
01:57:35,010 --> 01:57:36,920
and they both with the email

1729
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:40,170
so i get both the clustering and take

1730
01:57:40,180 --> 01:57:44,530
and of course you get soft clustering but you can always transform them into hard

1731
01:57:44,530 --> 01:57:47,340
plus the purpose of comparison

1732
01:57:47,350 --> 01:57:49,270
and the

1733
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:53,120
the next thing to do is to take the parameters from the second said

1734
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:56,480
and class again the first

1735
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:57,840
with that

1736
01:57:57,910 --> 01:58:02,140
that's because if you assume that data sets bold

1737
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:04,120
come from the same distribution

1738
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:06,860
the to just divided data

1739
01:58:08,260 --> 01:58:12,920
and in the true distribution of the data what that want should be very simple

1740
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:16,340
but you don't think that you compare the results of the cluster so just likely

1741
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:17,080
that two

1742
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:21,930
to be one and get another clustering of the first day that allow you to

1743
01:58:23,790 --> 01:58:29,550
if there are almost the same are similar then it means that

1744
01:58:29,550 --> 01:58:32,840
you have two independent witnesses the first the

1745
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:35,250
secondly on which you have got the same

1746
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:36,630
the same structure

1747
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:38,850
so maybe you have found this the

1748
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:46,200
and then you can repeat several times

1749
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:47,940
make sure that

1750
01:58:50,030 --> 01:58:51,150
that not

1751
01:58:51,150 --> 01:58:56,220
that's one logical system that we have this huge numbers systems infinitely many of them

1752
01:58:56,260 --> 01:59:00,830
called non-classical logic and we sort of put them on par with one another doesn't

1753
01:59:00,830 --> 01:59:02,190
seem fair does

1754
01:59:02,210 --> 01:59:03,890
one system over here

1755
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:07,190
a lot of people study in a huge mess systems is the few of us

1756
01:59:08,250 --> 01:59:09,390
that we study

1757
01:59:09,450 --> 01:59:10,750
over here

1758
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:16,760
why is that why classical logic got that positions anybody know

1759
01:59:16,820 --> 01:59:20,600
one classical logic so important what is it about classical logic

1760
01:59:20,610 --> 01:59:25,350
there's a few things

1761
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:30,420
OK here's some properties you some things classical first of all the historical reason classical

1762
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:34,670
logic was developed in

1763
01:59:34,690 --> 01:59:37,230
my whole bunch of people we respect lot

1764
01:59:37,270 --> 01:59:38,670
the ball

1765
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:40,330
george boole

1766
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:46,370
gottlob frege bertrand russell great that mathematicians and philosophers

1767
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:53,320
there's a whole bunch of results known about now because people studied it and it

1768
01:59:53,320 --> 02:00:00,350
became sort canonical the logic so historically this position but historical reasons are good now

1769
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:04,120
that they just that that's that's the way it happened to have to go to

1770
02:00:04,150 --> 02:00:10,590
some other interesting things about the mathematical property of classical logic that's very important

1771
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:14,580
anyone think of the mathematical property that of classical logic

1772
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:16,960
that makes it

1773
02:00:16,970 --> 02:00:18,350
so important

1774
02:00:19,850 --> 02:00:22,700
well almost limitless part of

1775
02:00:22,710 --> 02:00:27,670
that has embassies logic in a couple minutes the projects that is another property isn't

1776
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:29,830
in you know it's an ongoing of book

1777
02:00:29,870 --> 02:00:31,320
i was to this

1778
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:37,140
well it it was used to develop mathematics in particular set theory which was is

1779
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:40,250
the a foundation for mathematics and brilliant that

1780
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,720
it's done a brilliant job

1781
02:00:42,830 --> 02:00:46,880
OK so that's the mathematical reason was another mathematical reason

1782
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:48,970
i mean may not have heard

1783
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:54,720
its post complete

1784
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:58,890
the words and we know that means

1785
02:00:58,940 --> 02:01:01,990
OK is reason one that's the reason why you can come up with that

1786
02:01:02,010 --> 02:01:03,930
you don't know what i'm talking about

1787
02:01:05,490 --> 02:01:07,490
what happens

1788
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:09,510
so as you have

1789
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:14,220
some acts some axioms of a class for classical logic

1790
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:18,020
all right and

1791
02:01:18,190 --> 02:01:23,520
usually three axioms and rules ramsey at any length scale OK let's said

1792
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:27,590
this book accent

1793
02:01:29,710 --> 02:01:58,500
OK now these reaction scheme so it's closed and uniform substitution for variables

1794
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:01,790
OK now what happens if you have any new wax into a new axiom that

1795
02:02:01,790 --> 02:02:04,190
isn't already theorem

1796
02:02:04,210 --> 02:02:05,950
you know what happens

1797
02:02:06,050 --> 02:02:09,030
another approve this here usually

1798
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:17,110
yes we get a contradiction and what happens if cognition classical logic

1799
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:18,540
you get

1800
02:02:18,570 --> 02:02:20,240
everything it trivializes

1801
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:22,170
so there's only one

1802
02:02:22,230 --> 02:02:26,350
properly logical system that is bigger than us

1803
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:30,850
and that is the system contains every formula

1804
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:33,580
and that's not of the system

1805
02:02:33,580 --> 02:02:37,330
bob myers who was a professor here for many many years

1806
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:41,980
i still lives in canberra did come in for any of the summer school

1807
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:44,650
he sometimes does is quite a right now so

1808
02:02:46,610 --> 02:02:51,740
he's to call that logic the logic of absolute irrelevance

1809
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:56,140
so that's the but it's it's very easy for me

1810
02:02:56,170 --> 02:02:58,090
that's the axiom scheme

1811
02:03:00,530 --> 02:03:02,300
it also so people used to say

1812
02:03:02,310 --> 02:03:06,150
two will look it's very hard to prove things in relevant logic is very easy

1813
02:03:06,150 --> 02:03:10,660
to prove things classical logic is it here's logic is much easier to prove things

1814
02:03:11,590 --> 02:03:13,930
it's extremely zero proof is one line long

1815
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:19,350
so of the logical right because it gives us too much

1816
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:23,630
so i suppose the fact that classical logic post complete means that it's sort of

1817
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:26,200
at the top of the pyramid

1818
02:03:26,250 --> 02:03:29,530
there's is a lot of other logics need that

1819
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:33,840
so classical logics essentially no not always

1820
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:40,950
and this it here in australia especially the the monash university is

1821
02:03:41,050 --> 02:03:46,390
this was cumbersome and is one of the few people and his students eroticism there

1822
02:03:46,390 --> 02:03:51,150
are too few people and bob myron and john slaney in fact are among the

1823
02:03:51,150 --> 02:03:52,430
four people

1824
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:57,980
who study contra classical logic which are logics with

1825
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:02,760
axioms are rules that are in classical logic there are additional two

1826
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:07,270
but of course something from classical logic has to be rejected as well

1827
02:04:07,290 --> 02:04:10,280
but most classical most non-classical logics

1828
02:04:10,290 --> 02:04:14,100
at least the propositional level and quantifier level

1829
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:18,000
that those logical systems are

1830
02:04:18,080 --> 02:04:21,810
usually reject just reject something in classical logic one or more

1831
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:23,680
of the the

1832
02:04:23,690 --> 02:04:29,020
axioms and put in weaker axioms of some kind and so the weaker systems they

1833
02:04:29,020 --> 02:04:30,760
have fewer theorems

1834
02:04:30,770 --> 02:04:31,790
and then

1835
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:37,650
but they contain only theorems of classical logic and completeness

1836
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:41,190
gives classical logic etc
