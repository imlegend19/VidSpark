1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,630
calculator formula

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:08,130
for the plants transform of this guy if you already know the laplace transform of

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,850
now see this falls in that category because this is really needed the eighty times

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,080
one but i already know transform one so that if i can get a general

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,420
formula for this

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,980
i'll be able to get the formula for each of the eighty

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,470
as a consequence

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,350
so let's all look for the fourth postion that's really easy to see where my

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,340
doing calculations over here

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,190
so we got

11
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,080
so i want to calculate all plus from in the ATF six i'm going to

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,330
say that the integral from zero to infinity

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,310
of e the eighty

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,070
crimes f t

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,810
another is like out copy is high that's the function part of it because the

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,740
and then there's the

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,760
other parties part is called the kernel by the way but don't worry about that

18
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,590
however if you drop it in conversation

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,070
people also look at you in the

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,340
but also the idea

21
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,810
you will know the the kernel OK

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,050
i mean

23
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,380
well now what kind of formula could i be looking for

24
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,070
clearly i could only be looking for formula which expresses it in terms of

25
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,770
polar plus transform of f fifteen

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,510
but let's calculated see what we get

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,510
what would you do that they can make well obviously with thing to do is

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,690
combine the two exponentials

29
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,780
so that's going to be the integral from zero to infinity that t

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,580
now i'd like to put it

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,280
to combine the exponentials in such a way that has that still the same form

32
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,100
so i'm going to begin with a negative sign

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,730
and then see what the rest of it has to be

34
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,640
what is it going to be well

35
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,470
why is st

36
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,890
and plus eighty but i can make that minus a here and it will come

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,900
out right

38
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,780
so it's my necessity

39
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,390
plus eighty there are the two parts

40
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,180
those two factors

41
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,220
you take

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,920
so what's that

43
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,030
that's full force trans four

44
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,950
if this is the a weren't there this would be the old class transform of

45
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,070
what is it with the a there

46
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,910
it's full plos transform of f of t except

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,080
that instead of the variable as has been replaced by the variable x minus a

48
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:57,500
the second i just that

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,670
well you digest well on radio

50
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,850
because that's the answer

51
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:13,330
and the way this is most often used i had to qualify for the value

52
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,870
so if

53
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,340
if f of s

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,630
it's good for as positive of the way would be for example if i use

55
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,320
the function one here

56
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,220
finish that off

57
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,580
then after this might say

58
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,770
will be

59
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,260
this will be good when s is bigger than a

60
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,360
why is that well because

61
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,350
this is

62
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,870
this is true if

63
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,340
as my a positive

64
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,720
that's the condition

65
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,470
that's when this little plus transform is good but that simply says that should be

66
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,970
bigger than that

67
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,850
this is this does look pretty let me try to make a little prettier

68
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,830
so this is assuming

69
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,580
after this

70
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,360
is for greater than zero

71
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,010
now this is called something

72
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,550
this is called the well of

73
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,670
on the left side you multiply by an exponential

74
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,840
on the right

75
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,380
translate to shift the argument over by a so this is called

76
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,830
the exponential

77
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,660
what we called the formula

78
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,800
the thing before we talked about operators we call that the exponential shift rule

79
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,900
well the exponential shift law

80
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,680
but in fact

81
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,700
this is it in a way it disguised form of the same law

82
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,550
engineers who typically do

83
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:03,170
although work using plus transform and use operators of this is the form of the

84
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,070
exponential shift law that they would no

85
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,080
of what you can do with one you can do with the other you can

86
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,050
now use both

87
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,720
so what's the answer to each of the eighty

88
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,290
the answer is

89
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,040
i'm supposed to do

90
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,360
e the eighty times one

91
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,250
o plus transform one is one over s

92
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,290
and therefore what i do is

93
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,300
multiplied by each of the eighty

94
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,570
i change this to us

95
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,800
minus a

96
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,040
so that's the answer

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,440
but he will still we know well how about

98
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,620
size and cosine

99
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,170
well the way science and cosine is by making the observation that this formula

100
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,570
it also works with a is a complex number

101
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,530
so you can use

102
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,410
a complex number for e to the a one

103
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,630
BRI times t

104
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:17,250
o plus transform into the a plus b i times t is one over

105
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,580
mine is a plus b i

106
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,040
and again it will be for us because the

107
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,340
so let's calculate the past transform let's say

108
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,570
well i got to cover up something OK so

109
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,450
that's all plus transport

110
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,780
remember that

111
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,300
so let's calculate the laplace transform let's say sign

112
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,880
of eighty and cosine eighty what do you get for that

113
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,640
i just for a little variety we could do it by using that formula and

114
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,930
taking its real and imaginary parts of i'm going to

115
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:58,860
since some of you had so much difficulty

116
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,290
o with the

117
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,380
backwards oiler formula

118
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,530
is a good case where you could use it

119
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,700
but you want to calculate the plus transform cosine eighty

120
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,560
i'm going to write that using the back

121
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,260
i want to calculate using complex exponentials at the do it is by

122
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,140
they would be the most relevant search terms are the most relevant

123
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:29,810
bits of information for the radiologists also so this was our assumption so in the

124
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,980
the end we came up with these ranked lists of what we call are most

125
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,960
in terms of anatomy radiology and diseases for the limitations and we want to discuss

126
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,190
it with discussed with them to get their feedback

127
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,980
so we have these lists and we made all appointments around

128
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,200
all conditions are quite surprised actually

129
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,520
with our own achievement because we show our definitions our lists

130
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:04,550
so they got excited there were a lot of you i mean these terms are

131
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,690
generated you can mix them with these relations are related to each other things and

132
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,800
you can look here this resource and resource so suddenly they have lots of ideas

133
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,240
so the only they understood what we were suddenly we understood where they were so

134
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,980
we have the basis for our communication which we figured that was quite helpful

135
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:31,440
so for example one of the conditions that apparently the arteries are kind of light

136
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:36,130
spatial coordinates in our bodies so so they are able to keep track of our

137
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,910
of medical images based on the are trees like location where they are in the

138
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:46,980
image in the body so all this kind of information came out today so these

139
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,250
lists during the appointment which we really didn't have in the beginning

140
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:58,640
and this work is that has been already had with the results and these were

141
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,560
also presented in international conferences that was getting something about this query division technique

142
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,600
and work is still going on on this topic

143
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,980
next we came into the ontology identification

144
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,090
module or this up

145
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,770
such step let's take

146
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,230
well to to be a lot more complicated than we anybody in in the beginning

147
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,300
because of that information is always about three

148
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,770
perspective so we are kind of like you that the ontology

149
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,530
pre-defined for more or less fine for me because

150
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,590
four one for anatomy for idiology one for diseases but we still have to

151
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:48,010
actually says if these ontologies are appropriate for our purposes and if they are big

152
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,690
enough or if they are not so we had like certain criteria

153
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,030
the representation language to be OWL is it was pretty fine

154
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,850
it had to be comprehensive or we wanted them to be comprehensive because we didn't

155
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,090
want to make a mess important formation

156
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,800
and it is not domain experts we really could not also all there was no

157
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,950
way for us to know if these ontologies are really

158
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,170
good so we want we want by their popularity we look that they are well

159
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,650
known how many projects are using them

160
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,050
who is using them already well-documented so these are all the criteria that we also

161
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:35,940
even though the ontologies are determined we still look along this criteria two

162
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,090
to see

163
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,440
and i have the semantic formalism also to be the description logics so in the

164
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,540
end we ended up with these three ontologies

165
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,440
the list is not complete then might be others but currently we use the foundational

166
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,400
model of anatomy

167
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:57,720
four anatomical knowledge reflect the radiology lexicographer information about radiology and the NCI

168
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,640
cancer thesaurus for

169
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,290
the specific form use case

170
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:08,610
there's also be also drain these ontologies are available in two hundred nine

171
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,750
network portal which is quite good in the ontology portal for life science ontology if

172
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,310
you ever need it

173
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,900
to do any work there

174
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:25,640
and next i'm going to come to the ontology and alignment but really not going

175
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,400
to go too much into the details because this is very much

176
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,110
work in progress

177
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:36,580
but as i mentioned at some point now that we find these ontologies they need

178
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,250
to to

179
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,310
put together in a certain way

180
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,850
so that we can obtain the pieces of the puzzle

181
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,670
we can obtain the whole picture we are dealing with different types of

182
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,150
knowledge from different resources

183
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,830
so we need to integrate knowledge these different types of knowledge

184
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,840
in one picture and we need to the ontology aligned we into this problem is

185
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:09,230
ontology alignment under semantic integration task and we understand ontology alignment

186
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:16,690
the identification of it calling really cool and relationships between different types of ontology

187
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,670
that are relevant for image semantics

188
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,950
there are many approaches have about

189
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,650
people do that and most of them while some of them

190
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,410
two on me

191
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,990
on the schema level

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,570
they only managed ontologies some people not only the instances

193
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:40,820
some go with graph matching algorithms some go with NLP techniques most of them

194
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,290
use all of them together to combine their purchasing two rules seem to be the

195
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,290
most effective ones

196
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,910
and in theme and we also want to adopt a hybrid approach so we want

197
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,550
to make the best of all

198
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,740
of all the approach is possible available

199
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,750
maybe one additional thing that we want to

200
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,670
what we want to study further we want to add on top of it is

201
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:11,760
that we view ontology alignment also is an or the integration process also has contracted

202
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,610
process with the

203
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,630
user or with the radio radiologists for that matter like

204
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,000
the radiologist can

205
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:26,670
told to medical or if you like and confirm or negate and rejects

206
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,300
if b

207
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,610
proposed cooling speed or semantic relatedness

208
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,560
is good or not

209
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,160
so my life tells me that we're coming to me

210
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,980
final remark

211
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,550
let's we talked about so far

212
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:53,470
just that or we found that ontology engineering in the medical domain is

213
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,910
thanks for coming back but no one would come back

214
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:04,070
OK i didn't know what i had my first planned may not have shown but

215
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,070
i like what i was going to say

216
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,430
but i have no idea is for the second time

217
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,280
however fortunately during the coffee break

218
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,570
people might suggest and ask questions

219
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:18,000
and some issues raised so one thing i would like to say is

220
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,500
you know all of you when you work on pattern analysis in many different kinds

221
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,310
of work on pattern analysis is i've learned from this meeting

222
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,320
and all of you face the issue

223
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:32,060
in each case of weather pattern is is significant

224
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,550
or not whether experience or israel

225
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,180
this is a fundamental question which in every case you have to

226
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,250
you have to decide if you have to have an answer to that

227
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:47,580
and what i'm saying is this is a very fundamental question is so fundamental

228
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,800
the light discusses it

229
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:54,710
in his discourse on metaphysics discourse on metaphysics and sixteen eighty six

230
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,640
and it so fundamental that herman while in two books on philosophy while by the

231
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,050
way could you mention here with the dirac and in all these great physicist he

232
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,810
was besides being a wonderful mathematician he has two books on physics

233
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,620
two wonderful book from physics one called

234
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,880
round site not a on

235
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,880
on on on relativity theory

236
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,740
and another one on i think it was theory of groups and quantum mechanics

237
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,220
and so he is a pure mathematician who is respected by physicists the notion of

238
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,370
gauge invariance

239
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,870
is originally found in

240
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,430
in in work and while for example

241
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:42,270
and so he's he's a remarkable mathematicians so

242
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,600
so i'm not disagreeing with what you people are doing on the country and saying

243
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,660
this is a very fundamental questions

244
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,050
in fact it's so fundamental that the

245
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,750
lieberman violin from involves the fundamental question in way

246
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,880
in philosophy of science

247
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,630
so it's very basic issues

248
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,030
so you should feel good this problem that you face is is is is is

249
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,720
important problems

250
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,620
so i can not too

251
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,410
pre-season now i can not to bury about the price where

252
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,670
so that

253
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,230
the next question is

254
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,410
somebody came up to me and said

255
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,500
my last

256
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,190
but everything that you said isn't it come of complexity

257
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,440
i think i should answer that question so he asked me to talk about a

258
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,320
little bit about the history of this field

259
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,130
some of you may have heard of all of this under the name kolmogorov complexity

260
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,370
and you may notice that i was very careful not to use that name

261
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:50,570
i prefer to call this algorithmic information content or program size complexity

262
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,720
maybe i should give my version of the history of a little bit

263
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,940
but of course you know that everyone will have their own version

264
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,130
and in fact if you look at my book on metamap

265
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:08,060
one of the things i talk about is the controversy between newton and leibniz over

266
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,760
who invented the calculus

267
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,190
and this is a horrible thing

268
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,040
a war between philosophers title of

269
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,100
english folk and the object

270
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:25,040
i think it's better to avoid you know fighting over these things but since i

271
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,070
was asked someone was nice enough to ask me to talk a little bit about

272
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,220
the history of this

273
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,500
let me talk a little bit about the history of

274
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:37,600
this field i've back to alignment and fifty six but the modern version of these

275
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,810
really goes back to nineteen sixty

276
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,940
and the three main aims are raymond solomonoff who still alive

277
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,350
and there is an american interested in artificial intelligence and he wrote

278
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,250
a big paper or in two parts in

279
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,880
in a journal that i can recall the name

280
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,730
that this moment but anyway

281
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,200
his main interest was artificial intelligence

282
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,720
and he's still alive by the way

283
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,320
yes on period enormously long hair

284
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,230
and looks like a very interesting character

285
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,830
then there he was probably the first person to

286
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,060
talk about looking at the size of computer programs

287
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:23,430
and his main intention was induction he wanted machine learning he wanted artificial intelligence

288
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,620
and he was saying that are good way

289
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,230
a good approach would be you know this is the smallest program is the best

290
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,720
basically what he said so if you have to predict the future interested prediction

291
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,660
i'm interested in is there a theory for what we have observed up to now

292
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,080
cannot be comprehended

293
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,530
can be compressed

294
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,390
but but someone of was interested in predicting the future

295
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,160
so in his view a theory and mathematical theory of scientific theory would be a

296
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,420
computer program

297
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,420
which produces output first what you already saw and then it continues producing output and

298
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,330
that would be future observations

299
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,350
and he would say pick the

300
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,670
theory that is the simplest occam's razor

301
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,480
which would mean take the smallest computer

302
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,910
and in principle this would be a very good way

303
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,920
to do artificial intelligence except you can find the smallest computer program

304
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,530
you know but but but i think it's a very beautiful paper

305
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:23,210
of of solomonoff of now solomonoff didn't come up with the idea of a random

306
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,800
as being one that is unpredictable or incomprehensible

307
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,360
but the other two of us who

308
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,040
sort of a more independently i think i know in my case it was independent

309
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,120
came up with these ideas were basically interested in defining the notion of lot of

310
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,900
structure or lack of patterns

311
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:48,540
and the two of us were me and andrey kolmogorov who at that time was

312
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,090
i would suggest me what kind of magic which suggests me to break this network

313
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,350
into such hierarchical clustering in one intuition is that

314
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,710
these edges so what i want to to find something called

315
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,830
edge betweenness

316
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,880
when the idea that web when the betweenness of the edges the number of shortest

317
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,200
path that's

318
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,700
passing through the edge right so for example

319
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,090
if you and then once for every edge a calculate this importance or the amount

320
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:17,920
of flow

321
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:23,790
goes through it then i will be deleting these edges in the decreasing order of

322
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:29,540
their between school so to be more precise for example this edges between this forty

323
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,710
nine i because there are seven

324
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,780
nodes in this

325
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:38,050
this set the side of the network called have shortest path to seven nodes in

326
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,820
this next part of the network aldershot the spats have to go over the search

327
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,000
so forty nine short spats go over the search

328
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,680
and similarly this matches between the thirty three because the first three edges he three

329
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,050
notes here and eleven notes here and any shortest path from anyone here to anyone

330
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,320
in the rest of the network just across the search

331
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,750
so this is sort of the this one this one this one that one this

332
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,640
is sort of the edges that have the second highest betweenness and then this guy

333
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,700
here we can be left because from here

334
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,960
there is

335
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,640
either the from here to here there is a

336
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,040
this should be eleven nodes

337
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,490
the best through

338
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,420
eleven from here to any other node the shortest path first to pass here so

339
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,740
i have eleven

340
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,910
so he this is how this clustering would operate right first remove the largest the

341
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,590
largest edge and i'm getting the two clusters that i then i would go to

342
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,620
move the second highest betweenness and just now sort of getting this four clusters and

343
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,970
then this would be the right so the idea is that somehow

344
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,880
get an ordering over edges and then i'll keep removing them and the connected components

345
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,300
i get corresponds to customers

346
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,000
so just

347
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,040
here it is again the karate club that we see

348
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,430
today for the first time and this is the this is the clustering can get

349
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,880
it right or this is the dendrogram i'm getting great so when i when i

350
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,380
basically what i'm doing here and here

351
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:10,420
going bottom up and i'm heading i connect just whenever the than in order of

352
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,930
increasing between us

353
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:15,870
and then when i want to cluster i just decide on a particular court or

354
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,590
a particular speaking this and so if i got here then i get division of

355
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,960
these nodes versus those nodes and if i can't here then i for brigade division

356
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,080
of these nodes sort of the nodes versus this too

357
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,130
and here again this one

358
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,290
OK so that's one way

359
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:38,790
this is just a picture of the community the communities or clusters you find in

360
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:44,410
collaboration between physicists where every sort of every group here is

361
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,280
currently the different color and you can sort of see that it finds this then

362
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,210
groups then have you no one mentioned and is another dance group that has sort

363
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,960
of another edge and so on

364
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,840
OK so this is what the method finds

365
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,130
so what i want to create

366
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,670
show you now is how to compute the edge between the school

367
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,930
so the idea is you given we start with the network

368
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,990
we fix an old will ask how many short spats

369
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,420
from this node a flow

370
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,420
o every of these edges

371
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,160
the way we do this is to take a and sort of

372
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:22,960
order the nodes in sort of a breath first search breath first search fashion right

373
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,870
so these are all the all the nodes at distance one from a distance to

374
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:31,560
from a three from a fall from that and then when i'm doing his breath

375
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,000
first search i can just for every node i can count how many shorter spats

376
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,550
are that it is not right to where i can get it through this better

377
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,170
two final for two g there's just one shortest path to j there are three

378
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,590
like this one this one and that i think this is very easy all i

379
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,370
do is

380
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,530
i started you know he i started zero here

381
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,380
i have what counts one here and then we never go up i was i

382
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,260
just some of the number of shortest paths to my to my parents

383
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:06,010
and there are two things going on here three is two plus one nineteen sixties

384
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,530
three so i do is just sort of one breath first search

385
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,040
so this is the first step of the algorithm

386
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,880
and then once i had this

387
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:21,590
numbers these accounts associated nodes all i do now i'm sort of doing like another

388
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,490
now unlike preceding bottom up from the d

389
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,970
i read the idea is that

390
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,620
the amount of

391
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:33,670
sort of the county getting the node is one plus the sum over the parent

392
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,240
and then like splitting

393
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,340
discount based on the number of shortest paths that came to my parents so here

394
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,920
i have one last fifty fifty fifty

395
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,800
and then in this case i got so i got one short this sort of

396
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,100
i got one point five to be node in half because of the search so

397
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,830
now i have one half the they need to split

398
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,960
in the proportions of two n one so i give have here and i give

399
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,870
a one here

400
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,470
but now what disturbs me is that there is one short standard goes this way

401
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,780
what i mean this is basically

402
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,760
because there are

403
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,990
there are

404
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,260
cleveland show spence i sort of called inflection

405
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:19,090
so the idea is this gets one half because there's shortest go this way and

406
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,460
this gets one because the one shortest path and the other from the space here

407
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,540
but two shorter spans goal this guy and one gets over here so that's why

408
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,750
this is the ratio then i'm sort of i can just like world cup

409
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,710
the tree

410
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,790
and split discounts were always some sort of

411
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,990
taking the sum

412
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:42,710
taking one class whatever i have on my on my chin the edges what weight

413
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,660
i have on the edges of my children

414
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,920
and they stated that based on the

415
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,330
in the proportion

416
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,990
to my to my parents

417
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:50,920
and this way

418
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:55,660
i find the bitterness of the edges from a particular node now i produced for

419
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,630
every node

420
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,030
and i get between the scores of all the edges

421
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,840
and then i just go and remove the edges in the

422
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,990
difficult for biological molecules to be totally flat for an extended period and the helix

423
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,030
in fact something

424
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:12,380
that is frequently resorted to witness the alpha helix in the the in the protein

425
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,400
so these are turned around it turns out that each of these constitutes a base

426
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,610
and each of these base pairs is in fact

427
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,780
three point four angstroms

428
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,920
if a is three point four angstroms

429
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,800
so you have ten of the DNA helix advances three point four

430
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,860
thirty four angstroms every

431
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,110
every ten ten turns

432
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:47,190
and ten turns is roughly are i'm sorry ten base pairs is roughly one turn

433
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,280
of the alpha helix if you go up here count of ten we should start

434
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,010
again the same orientation another ten is another term another ten is another term

435
00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:00,070
in fact i'm just recalling that when i was one city eighteen seven one

436
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:06,740
nineteen sixty five and there was a physics professor who became a biologist always talked

437
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:14,720
these double helix is a double helix is any always talked about

438
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,610
the measurements of different DNA molecules that you may know

439
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,630
the term angstrom is

440
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,210
named after

441
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,030
a danish person named angstroms

442
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,840
that's why got its name

443
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,990
so whatever this professor whom i never corrected god forbid ever talk about something that

444
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,900
was ten angstroms long

445
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,920
he called these ten

446
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:42,530
and struck

447
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,530
now as you know

448
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:47,090
when you go into latin from singular to plural it's

449
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,900
o to right

450
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,760
so he pretend this was the latin word

451
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,920
what's what's a good word

452
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,260
sorry what's good what's common latin where we use

453
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,740
millennium millennium millennia

454
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,920
so he went from amsterdam thanks

455
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,550
and went on for a whole year i never said anything

456
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,950
but i know better okay anyhow

457
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:14,740
here you see the genius of watson and crick

458
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,970
and by the way thanks to mister dane as i said another roman soldiers here

459
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:20,820
we see

460
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,110
OK so

461
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:27,260
here is the genius of their discovery

462
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,320
and the elegance of it is not how complicated it is the elegance of it

463
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,340
is how simple it is

464
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,820
because information we see is encoded into strands the information is redundant

465
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,400
because we can if we know the sequence of one strand

466
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,510
we can obviously predict

467
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:49,490
the sequence and the other strand because it's a complementary sequence if we always we

468
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:53,010
realized that a is opposite TNG is opposite c

469
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,780
we can now directly the sequence in one strand which may be a c t

470
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,820
in the other strand

471
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,920
moving in the other antiparallel direction

472
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,130
the the

473
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,260
the sequence is like this

474
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,090
i don't need to know the sequence of the other strand i can be predicted

475
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:19,900
by using these rules is called rules of complementary sequence structure and that in turn

476
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:25,110
obviously has important implications if if we look at the three-dimensional structure this is more

477
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,840
of what's called the space filling models

478
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,690
this is the way my the x-ray crystallography would actually depicted we talked about space

479
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,670
filling models models before

480
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,970
one of the things we appreciate

481
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,720
it is the fact

482
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,320
the phosphate

483
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,030
are on the outside

484
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:47,760
and these spaces are in the inside because these spaces have are able also to

485
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,280
start with one another

486
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:56,440
the hydrophobic interactions importantly the basis are protected the face where they interact is protected

487
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,010
from the outside world

488
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,380
what do i mean by that well let's go back to this figure right here

489
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,070
you see the interaction faces between a and t

490
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,510
four CNG then on the outside of the helix

491
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,300
there are hidden in the middle

492
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,630
and that's important because it means that these interactions between a and c and g

493
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,110
and you can see it up here as well

494
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:21,820
biochemical chemically protected from any accidents it might happen in the outside their sheltered from

495
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:28,490
that and that's important because the information content in DNA must be held very stable

496
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:33,400
very constant if it isn't then we have real trouble like cancer and therefore the

497
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,340
whenever cell divides in copies its DNA it's three billion base pairs of DNA whenever

498
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,760
that happens the number of mistakes that are made is only three or four five

499
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,860
three billion

500
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,690
a stunning something the low rate and this DNA consider on i told you about

501
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:57,530
neanderthal DNA consider around four thirty thousand years and it's bile is chemically relatively stable

502
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:02,190
in part testimonial to the fact that this base pair in the face where the

503
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:07,710
two bases interact across one another this is shielded from

504
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,170
the outside world because it's tucked into the middle

505
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,300
this these interaction faces here this is the inside of the helix here the phosphate

506
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,590
groups of sugar phosphate groups are on the outside

507
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,320
in fact when watson and crick were

508
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,900
we're struggling with the structure double helix they were in the horse racing with a

509
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,800
man named linus pauling

510
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,740
who was really the inventor the discover the hydrogen bond pretty much

511
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,010
who actually got two nobel prizes in his lifetime

512
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:41,550
who ended his life believing that if you took kind of vitamin c

513
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,690
grams with every day never get sick

514
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,740
i don't know what he died of the probably like doctor atkins he probably died

515
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,740
an illness he was trying to ward off

516
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,240
or it might have died of kidney failure for all the

517
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,760
vitamin c was putting in this way the analysis

518
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:59,340
i digress

519
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,220
but the fact is

520
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,510
the fact is that pauling was thought that the that in fact the con was

521
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,440
constituted of triple helix with three strands

522
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,010
and the bases were facing outward

523
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,320
well of course now we can see snicker now we can laugh but at the

524
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,760
time nobody in any idea

525
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,070
now we realize it's only a double helix on the basis of facing inward and

526
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,690
of course because i

527
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,780
appalling worked with their preconceptions he was never able to figure out what's actually going

528
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,110
on even though i watson crick thought that he had the answer and was about

529
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,720
to scoop

530
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,950
implicit in what i just said is the notion

531
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:42,050
that the structure of DNA which we'll talk about later

532
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,220
allows it to be copied by e now

533
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:51,990
referring in passing and we'll get this in greater detail later the whole process of

534
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,050
because if we have genetic material

535
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:01,130
and we've created a certain sequence we we must be able to make more copies

536
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,420
of it

537
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,090
keep in mind that each one of us as i mentioned use some lectures ago

538
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,590
we start out with the fertilized egg with one human genome

539
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:16,220
and through our lifetimes we produce how many cells in your remember

540
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,650
i did mention it right

541
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,320
is there one

542
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:25,720
nevertheless story of sodium moreover the lord says if there's one soul

543
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,350
OK maybe we should be playing the odds a little bit the algorithm should not

544
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,790
be saying i'm going to assume that i'm in the worst case and and learn

545
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,900
to make sure that worst case gets covered

546
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,490
you know it it should be able to

547
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,630
well i've seen lots of states before i'm just going to take a gamble and

548
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,200
say the state is probably like some of these other states looks like it smells

549
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:53,040
all right so

550
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,690
i think that's the main thing i wanted to bring up with the song and

551
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,350
also more about that means as i go

552
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,870
so this leads i think very naturally to a bayesian perspective for two reasons one

553
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:04,830
is because it seems to be the natural solution to this kind of problem and

554
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,590
the other one is if you look at the talks from today

555
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,260
right it was like one thing after another about these bayesian models for nonparametric bayes

556
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,280
so there's really no way i could give my talk today without having to be

557
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,870
the point just it just seem natural so

558
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:22,090
so yes so obviously this what you have to go to a nonparametric or more

559
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:26,440
generally to the bayesian perspective and so what does that mean in reinforcement learning settings

560
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,070
so what are we what are priors over what we going to do with that

561
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,490
so what we're going to do

562
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:35,530
start off with the prior over possible models so if we

563
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,440
from the this this is a model based reinforcement learning perspective the thing we're trying

564
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,340
to learn thing which i get out of our data is the description of the

565
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:46,800
dynamics what's going to happen if i choose this action in the state so of

566
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,030
the space of all possible transition functions we're not gonna lay down some kind of

567
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:54,160
prior that says which ones are likely which kind of transition functions you expect and

568
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,500
which one should we do not expect and which ones are impossible

569
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:01,300
so we start off with a prior then as we actually go wandering around in

570
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,620
the world we can update that and and and say well i thought i might

571
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,750
have been in the kind of world where i could fly

572
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,260
it turns out not to be so side pushed the probability that down and put

573
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,860
the probability other things up to compensate and basically just keep poster updated with respect

574
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,030
to the actual experience in the world

575
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,330
and now that we're doing that now we have the notion of posterior we can

576
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:27,940
talk about more less likely models instead of just this models possible this bottles impossible

577
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,570
we can say this is possible but new right i really have to put much

578
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,450
energy into because it's very unlikely so i will that's a good thing but how

579
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,070
do we actually use that idea to do exploration how we actually act in the

580
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,890
world given that we've got a posterior over models

581
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,220
so there's this this is very nice notion which has been very seductive to many

582
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,560
people in the field i got drawn into this for a long time of

583
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:56,790
bayes optimal exploration like i want to solve the exploration exploitation problem with a second

584
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:01,150
i can set this mathematically and solve optimally how do we know

585
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,020
it would be better than that

586
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:10,120
so so what is that what does that mean so let me step through an

587
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,840
example of how that actually works which would be perfect models we can plan in

588
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,400
the space of posteriors right so what does that mean we have we have the

589
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,660
current posterior in with the world that we the space world that we think we

590
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,850
might be in and we know what actions we can try and for each of

591
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:27,090
those worlds we can imagine what should happen

592
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:30,100
and we can know how likely that would be because we have a distribution over

593
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,500
the world

594
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,240
and we can see how that would change the posterior

595
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:37,290
so we had to post here if i was to go right how much how

596
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,670
my my post your change

597
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,820
so i can think about that even without doing that i could just do it

598
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,930
all in my head because of the bayesian

599
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:50,590
with infinite computational resources can choose actions that truly marked so so then what so

600
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,640
we can use actually project this out a large number steps and say OK well

601
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,640
eventually you know there is some probability all died some point but let me just

602
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,220
out search out to the horizon and say

603
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,360
of all the things i could do which one is going to lead me to

604
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:09,120
the highest expected reward where the expectation is taken over not only the probabilities in

605
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,750
the model right so what's the probability that if this is the world and actually

606
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,260
in this action will be successful but also the probability distribution of models and how

607
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,940
that will evolve over time

608
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:25,100
so the thing is so beautiful about this is there's no longer any artificial distinction

609
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,180
between exploring and exploiting

610
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,570
or learning and acting really is it's all just one lovely solution to one the

611
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:35,270
one problem trying to sell which is maximizing rewards so

612
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:40,000
that's very very nice the last bullet well we can ignore that

613
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,250
now i mean it's important it is it is hideously intractable to actually do this

614
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:49,410
acceptance is some special cases like bandit problems where you have a set of actions

615
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,550
and they don't change of state but they have their own payoffs and they are

616
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,990
all independent of each other that one turned out to be solved and it's very

617
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:01,050
pretty or really short horizons like i'm going to live three steps OK what's going

618
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,320
to build the big tree it's going to be very complicated but it's only three

619
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,850
steps so it's not so bad

620
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,010
and here's one with just two steps so so let me see if i can

621
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,000
set this up

622
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,040
if we had three nodes

623
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,600
bayesian networks

624
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:26,940
we can have the same types of rocks

625
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:38,870
and these two types of graphs

626
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:42,930
they beheaded one way

627
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,200
if you observe

628
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:52,170
then this should become independent

629
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,560
and this should become usual

630
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,710
if you conditions that

631
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,720
observation conditions

632
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,440
follow can if you conditions

633
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,220
on c

634
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:10,130
so basically

635
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,910
a b

636
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:21,020
this is a e

637
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,940
it's all here

638
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,200
independent of b

639
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:30,110
you can see

640
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:37,290
eight is independent of the sea

641
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:41,480
this geographical conditional independence statements hold

642
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,600
but in this graph

643
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,920
these conditions state the art

644
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,920
instead whole using this condition the

645
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,780
eight is in the field

646
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,440
because if you want to to see you need to have

647
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:13,730
that knowledge of all these will tell you something about

648
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,180
this is a good point in this

649
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,470
related to what

650
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,780
we are going to

651
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,490
to see in

652
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,840
the well

653
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,680
in fact there is no

654
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,560
one to one relationship between

655
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,090
conditional independence

656
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:52,840
a type of the graph

657
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,970
we'll see later that there are clusters

658
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:04,540
intersection in this class

659
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:09,830
what if you want see

660
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,990
in australia this true

661
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,530
it doesn't mean that two graphs

662
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,160
i proof

663
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,200
the factories the factorizations

664
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,990
in fact

665
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:35,880
there is no one to one correspondence between factorizations

666
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,120
and what was so there is a one-to-one correspondence between

667
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,460
factorizations here conditional independence

668
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,380
well actually we have factor

669
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,920
on a c

670
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:55,280
and there's the fact that you're on the

671
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:59,750
it the fact that on a CD in the fact that the

672
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,900
the reason why these things are things

673
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,760
but he will see the

674
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,440
we cannot separate into two fact

675
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,470
in gen

676
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,880
in general this the functionality via this p of

677
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,880
c given a b and c

678
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,900
you can not assume that

679
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:25,030
you'll see that they

680
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,800
and you see

681
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,200
let's say that in general

682
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,000
this is just a function the divided the function to work

683
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,050
on the other hand

684
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,130
one these two graphs here

685
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,600
you can see that this is in fact

686
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,480
some function one

687
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,300
of the sea

688
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,050
and some function two

689
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,980
of the

690
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,140
we're function one of sea

691
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:58,600
can be for example you're a fancy times you've see

692
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,830
the function to be can be p of the

693
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,220
and these here likewise you have some

694
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,830
u one of the sea

695
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:14,020
five j two or c b

696
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,940
where g one can be p of a

697
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:19,460
p of the given name

698
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:22,200
the future can be you know you can see

699
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:30,610
and of course this corresponds the initial offensive can check has

700
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,730
i will see these things become

701
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,020
more interesting when you combine

702
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,910
these in

703
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,130
in large graphs

704
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,980
during side b

705
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,200
and you for the clear difference

706
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,960
it should just get make out of course there are the other

707
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:56,040
which is the graphs

708
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,550
o denote

709
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,470
it's not very interesting

710
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:09,300
and there is the graph the nodes

711
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:14,300
the graph has no error is is that is all the

712
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:19,130
these are the five possible graph but these guys are not very interesting because this

713
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,360
all the conditional independence statements hold

714
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,650
in this case no conditions in the first

715
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,990
so have to study much

716
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:39,940
so we said in this case the

717
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,000
OK so that's why i mentioned my

718
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,250
in the beginning

719
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,600
because the p

720
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:15,200
how are you

721
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,040
so technically

722
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,370
b that will be

723
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,180
the network

724
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,960
that the graph so

725
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,870
but there really exists

726
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,900
there will exist to given or

727
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,480
such that

728
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,470
are if you take any two nodes

729
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:37,190
you need to know

730
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,470
and you fall

731
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:39,660
the pair

732
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:42,840
the old

733
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:45,340
o two the

734
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,920
where you start has a small and

735
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:56,460
you know hundreds of millions of data points like you know every time somebody clicks

736
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,150
on an add-on

737
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,120
you know microsoft being

738
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:04,250
you know it goes into probabilistic model somewhere

739
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,250
then does inference there not using bayesian nonparametric methods for that

740
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:17,350
they want something really fast that they can paralyze and running the online streaming manner

741
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,290
this is harder to do that with this information with all about this a minute

742
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:25,920
but i remind me if i don't

743
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,020
just as a reminder

744
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,900
there are two

745
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:50,760
families that have occupied a lot of interest in adding machine learning and statistics community

746
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:53,880
and i'm going to just basically review will little bit

747
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,930
and then i will talk a little bit about some

748
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:01,960
the interesting thing is that one can do

749
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,990
within nonparametric framework and then come back to

750
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,140
some of the

751
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,920
ups and downs of the framework is well towards the

752
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:13,920
OK so here are some basic building blocks for a lot of bayesian nonparametrics

753
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:17,350
one of them is the guassian process

754
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,910
and this defines a distribution over functions

755
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:24,210
so this is a sample from

756
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,460
guassian process it's a draw from a function

757
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,220
and guess process is really

758
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,100
but most importantly we can think of it as an infinite dimensional gaussians distribution so

759
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:39,840
just like the multivariate gaussians it has the mean and covariance but now it's a

760
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,230
mean function

761
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:45,920
and the covariance function that takes two arguments

762
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:50,620
a lot of models we have unknown functions

763
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,320
and we can plug in downstream processes in those places and then we can worry

764
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,430
about whether

765
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,620
that makes sense or not as

766
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,740
a distribution over functions

767
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,610
the other

768
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:09,540
processes and study law in bayesian nonparametrics is dirichlet process this defines a distribution on

769
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,970
distributions are measure measures

770
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:16,360
so think of of it as a function this nonnegative

771
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:19,310
and it integrates to one

772
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:26,560
and again just it just like the guassian process is infinite dimensional analog of finite

773
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,590
dimensional which is the dirichlet distribution

774
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,200
so we see g

775
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,470
it is a random probability measure

776
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:36,070
is drawn from a dirichlet process

777
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,690
with base measure or monumental mean

778
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,210
g zero

779
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:44,440
and then concentration parameter alpha

780
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,160
which controls the

781
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,250
so dispersion around the mean

782
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,430
and so

783
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:58,560
these are probability distributions over infinite dimensional quantities in this case functions in this case

784
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:07,120
so i

785
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:08,590
with permission

786
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:12,690
i borrowed a few slides from peter in are

787
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:17,440
and this is a nice like to motivate why people are interested in things like

788
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,450
galaxy and processes and actually processes

789
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,880
which is this notion of coverage of priors

790
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,440
so imagine

791
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,070
you have a space of

792
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:34,610
all possible objects that you want to put probability distributions over

793
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:36,200
so for example

794
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,720
this could be

795
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:42,200
the space of all measures

796
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,150
well now

797
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,510
you know it's drawn the triangle because you know you can think of it as

798
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,430
measures on you know three

799
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,930
probability distributions over

800
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:55,910
three possible events OK

801
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,840
but i think of it as more

802
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,790
and dimensional

803
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,410
tropical like

804
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:03,330
OK so

805
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:09,160
measures are measures or measures on on functions this is a really big space OK

806
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,470
this thing in great

807
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:16,760
usually when we define the class of models in the classical parametric world

808
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,980
we restrict ourselves

809
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:21,450
to some subspace of this

810
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,070
OK so for example this could be

811
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,950
the trial here could be all functions

812
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,240
this could be

813
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,080
polynomials up to order two

814
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:33,480
all right

815
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,150
and of course

816
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:39,490
polynomials of order two

817
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:43,870
don't have good coverage in the space of functions

818
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,560
right because

819
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,840
you know there good modelling polynomials of order two

820
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,420
for any function that i think in some suitable class of functions

821
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,930
suitably large cluster functions is not the case

822
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:03,070
that there is a polynomial of order two this arbitrarily close to it

823
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:08,500
i'm not spreading probability mass over this whole space in nicest way of course i

824
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,610
can do it turns out

825
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,100
for reasons that are

826
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:16,410
a little beyond my mathematical abilities that

827
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:20,910
you know i can put a distribution on the space of all functions as way

828
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,580
too bigger space

829
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:25,070
but you can put it

830
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,750
distributions on

831
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,930
very very large subspaces of those things

832
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,150
like you know near all

833
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:35,130
continuous functions let's

834
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:40,580
so what we want is we want our prior to have good coverage

835
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,980
in the sense that means that

836
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,690
we want our models to put to sprinkle probability mass

837
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,320
near everywhere on this triangle

838
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,670
they will cover the whole triangle but there will be

839
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,660
kind of probability dust all over the place

840
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:57,940
so when when the truth

841
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,660
is somewhere

842
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:03,200
there is some probability mass near that

843
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,240
in this case

844
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,920
if you're true generating process

845
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,440
right so it's not quite as

846
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,340
you know

847
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:15,600
you might

848
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:24,210
one of the parts on the bigger blogs socializing that optimises the bound holds

849
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:29,880
he because my cost gets higher

850
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:33,770
right i have to read more like since i considering the small one i can't

851
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:37,390
overfit too much in the future so here i am really like overfitting on the

852
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:40,190
future here i can't always the future

853
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,520
and here i'm saying i am OK

854
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:49,130
because you can select a small ones so you're cost increases far higher farther and

855
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:53,430
farther and farther so this is basically equiv is what is that is that you

856
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:58,580
can decide on the block street today and tomorrow used in the well

857
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,240
so there are or the other way to look at this is that there are

858
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,010
people who are constantly in

859
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:10,270
important so there is participating in an important story is not necessarily a matter of

860
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,180
it would be this would be the case

861
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,640
but this is solution

862
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,550
can basically get too close

863
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:21,260
two two two doing well on the unknown future

864
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,310
and then the last thing i have to show

865
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,360
it is this

866
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,310
scalability right so here we have the number of blocks we select and here is

867
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:34,560
the running time in seconds and

868
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,690
this is the if we would do the exhaustive search so here we would do

869
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:40,880
the basically we would need to and what we here we go and enumerate all

870
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,460
possible subsets of particle size and this way we would get the optimal solution but

871
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:51,440
you should software be and then this is the gradient greedy algorithm which basically scales

872
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,500
quadratically right for every additional sensory place you have to sort of go and check

873
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:01,190
all other sensors why this is this optimisation where we are doing this lazy evaluations

874
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:04,670
as explained before and this scales much better so in this case we were getting

875
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:06,690
like seven hundred times speed

876
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:09,210
by using this link

877
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,440
and i should

878
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,150
they can be bent cases

879
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:21,750
right i mean that can be better so you can come up with cases where

880
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:26,500
the speeding up doesn't really speed up anything

881
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,480
right so

882
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,690
there are many cases where this so degree should be the same as as blue

883
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:35,810
but in reality it seems it's not

884
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:43,600
so the other the other data that we were testing one is this water distribution

885
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:48,600
networks OK here i have a featured picture is a real metropolitan area where we

886
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:54,170
have like twenty one thousand homes and twenty five thousand pipes connecting these homes and

887
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:56,330
this is this is how these things look

888
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:02,290
and what we did is we use some realistic simulator that sort of similar to

889
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:06,170
how the water is drained through the day and it useful information about the diameter

890
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,980
of pipes and flow and everything else and we use a cluster of fifty machines

891
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:15,520
for a month to to to simulate three point six different epidemic scenarios right epidemic

892
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,900
scenario would be that this particular time of the day of this particular node some

893
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:24,610
poisonous introduced another estimating how these spreads over the network so that's why

894
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:29,600
the the number of possible epidemics scenarios is much larger than the number of nodes

895
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,690
because the time of the day also matters and so on and that is the

896
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:37,580
water consumption is different three different times of the day also the for the action

897
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:41,330
of the flow of the water in the pipes is different for different times of

898
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:45,170
the day it as it turns out so

899
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:48,790
we have this we got a hundred fifty two data bytes of data that then

900
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,020
by exploiting some sparsity and

901
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:56,790
instead of like really optimizing the function you are optimizing the reduction so instead of

902
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:02,730
optimizing the reward optimizing the reduction in penalty so a lot of better placements get

903
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:08,100
the reduction of of zero and these users sparsity so these another because i wasn't

904
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:12,520
talking about but basically it allows us from getting four hundred fifty megabytes the sixteen

905
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,750
megabytes of data and i can

906
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:17,290
did this in main memory and everything goes

907
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:22,480
right so again the same same same type of credit card as i was showing

908
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,000
so here is the number of sensors that we select replace and is again the

909
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,630
reduction in the population affected and again this is our solution this is what

910
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:35,150
he previously thought we could be the optimal now we know the optimum is somewhere

911
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:39,630
in between blue and green so again our solution

912
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:43,560
as it as it turns out is much better than what we saw before

913
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,460
you could consider different

914
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,840
heuristic placement so again we have a number of sensors and the

915
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,190
reduction in the population affected and

916
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:01,460
for example if you if we go and side we will place

917
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:07,690
the the sensors on only the big pipes right so we sort of the nodes

918
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:12,060
or by the way i think the some of the the the weight of incoming

919
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:16,560
pipes and this is in this way we decided to present his works very badly

920
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:20,290
again if we decide and putting it on these in a single where the the

921
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:25,830
the water flows through we put them there again that works really that interesting united

922
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:29,920
the red line is the population so for every node we know what the population

923
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:35,000
that particular note and now we say OK we'll put the sensors the most populated

924
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,360
note that also works better and we are you can notice that we are optimizing

925
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:43,100
the population affected so intuitively you would think that

926
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:47,600
putting it on most populated notes should do well but it doesn't really

927
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,210
and then degree of one of just how many bytes mean that that works quite

928
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:56,980
well in the end i also surprisingly works well in this case and this is

929
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,860
how well we can do

930
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,130
and we can do much better by the

931
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:05,480
the company spreads over the network

932
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:12,060
so this is first and i think one of the last slide is this about

933
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:16,830
different how different reward functions give different placements right so for example here the reward

934
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:21,610
function is the population affected so we want to minimize the number of people affected

935
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:26,940
animals bees bumblebees birds and other in of good bayesians

936
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,860
but people now

937
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,270
it's not the species

938
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,670
it's the representation

939
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:38,690
and most of the conditional probabilities but we get the face

940
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:42,020
the same problem does not only occur in

941
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,590
medicine but also in the court

942
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:50,150
in the law the typical legal scholar has

943
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,130
even less

944
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:57,050
into action with statistical thinking than the average doctor

945
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:02,000
out of the one hundred seventy five accredited law schools in the US only want

946
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:06,590
teachers occasionally cause methodology and statistics

947
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,880
and i actually have taught at the university virginia

948
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,480
probably the only

949
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:15,070
was the lobster

950
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:19,440
and you cannot imagine how this article sharp

951
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,610
men and women how little they know

952
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:25,630
when it comes to numbers

953
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:26,710
here is

954
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,960
here is the study that we did in berlin

955
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:36,900
we professionals that means judges and professors of law and students law students with the

956
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,750
same type of problems

957
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,770
so there is

958
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,400
typically there is say a murder

959
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,800
and this DNA evidence

960
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:50,170
it's the same structure as the mammography problem have the same thing

961
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,030
and just to make it sure

962
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:55,300
when the information is in conditional probabilities

963
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,570
few professors of law understand

964
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:02,190
when the information is not all frequencies than it

965
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:07,440
goes up and the same is the case for the students and more even more

966
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,190
there has to be a guilty verdict

967
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:11,940
the law

968
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,210
and you can see

969
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,840
the guilty verdicts

970
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:19,940
depends strongly from the representation though

971
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,520
the professors of law and the judges are confused without noticing

972
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:30,460
then the more often say

973
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:31,940
there is

974
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,500
i'm important message to the courts so i've been training

975
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,500
u s federal charges

976
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:46,980
teaching them about these differences so in one of these messages is the not allow

977
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,550
single event probabilities and other confusing things in

978
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:52,460
the court

979
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,730
and some have acted on that

980
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:59,980
it is actually the first orchard simpson trial research went into the trial

981
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,690
and just illustrated for you a simple question maybe

982
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,710
you will be accused to have a

983
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,590
where the first

984
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:13,000
he good for

985
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:17,070
it was not there's no evidence against you

986
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:23,710
except for one of his DNA matches mister traces from the victim so used to

987
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:25,750
try and the charge

988
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:27,920
i have no training in statistics thing

989
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,090
so i call an expert

990
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,590
and ask

991
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:33,320
what this is actually

992
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,710
the expert says

993
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,210
the probability that these

994
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:43,320
magic chains one hundred thousand

995
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:47,230
doesn't look good for you

996
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:50,880
you would agree

997
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,770
the probability that these matches were played chains one hundred thousand

998
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:57,110
so what we teach

999
01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:03,340
judges is to recognise this is what another source of confusion in the courtroom

1000
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:07,770
when nobody notices we asked them to send these

1001
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:13,920
expert witnesses back and ask them make a frequency statement so now the expert witness

1002
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,270
comes again says

1003
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:18,940
what it means is to find out of every hundred thousand people

1004
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,650
one with match

1005
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,920
now we are in the same building

1006
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,270
three point five million so we expect thirty five

1007
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,360
that's the difference you can easily see

1008
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,960
how people are being misled be no over number of court cases where exactly that

1009
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,230
there's an unknown number

1010
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:41,420
but still needs to be discovered

1011
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,110
and here i show you

1012
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:45,300
and as an illustration of the

1013
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:49,770
what we call collective statistical illiteracy now back to help

1014
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:51,590
these are

1015
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:54,360
the german bundestag

1016
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,150
the german parliament

1017
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:58,750
has in two thousand two

1018
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:01,290
put in all

1019
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:07,690
that's according to which women aged fifty and older as a right for

1020
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:11,730
mammography screening and health insurance will pay

1021
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:16,360
and you will find in the deutsche that's the plot that's the

1022
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,400
so if i if i were here i have a whole bunch of topics available

1023
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,240
and i can generate some words i go down here i have a whole bunch

1024
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,840
of other topics available connected to other words and so on down a branching tree

1025
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,300
i'd like to find ways the branching factors what's the death

1026
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,030
and what are the topics need to know

1027
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:35,760
the document will be a path through tree

1028
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,700
and the topics along that path the want to be able to generate a document

1029
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:43,570
included sharing in many different ways in this in this thing in particularly

1030
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:47,900
molecular literally shared node entry is higher up in the tree

1031
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:50,860
so how do you do this well it's pretty straightforward to set up the chinese

1032
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,780
restaurant metaphore elaborated that

1033
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,990
you get this so

1034
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:59,110
the metaphor is that tourists arrived city for clarification seaborne

1035
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:01,320
and there are there for a certain number of nights

1036
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:04,840
and they all go to the same room restaurant that this restaurant here

1037
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:08,630
and the tables that you guys for people that

1038
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:12,220
and at the table food you it but also the no which tells you which

1039
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,420
respond to go to the next night

1040
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:18,200
right now next you go to the restaurant and the number of tables picnic table

1041
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,630
against people their tables

1042
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:24,470
and then at that table is again although tells you which respond next night and

1043
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:25,380
so on

1044
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,920
we generate a random branching tree

1045
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:31,130
and people who first details could take parameters

1046
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:36,740
and both parameters in different clusters for associated with those people

1047
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:41,720
so that's it that's sort of how you do it and you have to write

1048
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:44,170
software to this and this really work

1049
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:47,720
here's some artificial data generated data

1050
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:51,110
this is the real trees that we generated randomly

1051
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:53,630
so this is the true over here

1052
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,530
and then we generated topics and words and so on so for this and this

1053
01:04:56,530 --> 01:05:00,070
is the posterior mode of the inference procedure after it's all done

1054
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:02,240
this is the most probable tree

1055
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:05,220
and in matter is this and if you go through all these examples is pretty

1056
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:08,170
close to really does recover underlying tree

1057
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:14,090
so we apply this to some data this is from psychology danger abstract from the

1058
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:18,280
articles from psychology today over many years

1059
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:22,780
we plug in data and there really are no free parameters this algorithm finds the

1060
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:27,150
best tree find the best branching factor finds topics and does everything

1061
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:29,240
and you can see it does pretty well

1062
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:33,130
the words that are the most useful all documents in the percolate up the root

1063
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:37,170
in particular function or part of the route you have to away function words

1064
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:41,220
the especially when you go to the room very small documents

1065
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:44,780
and then the next level down here words which are useful in some areas of

1066
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:49,930
psychology and then as you go down things which are just more and more concrete

1067
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:53,320
and we did this may be the more familiar from JACM

1068
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,340
again function were partly at the top and then we got through the areas of

1069
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:58,340
computer science at the next level

1070
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,450
algorithms theory database and and so on and then you go down further you AND

1071
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,880
get more and more concrete time to work

1072
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:08,920
and this is my letter last slide

1073
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:14,380
so there are hyperparameters this was the bayesian talk there are always some hyperparameters somewhere

1074
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,340
that's always bayesian bet noir how you deal with some of these things

1075
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:22,550
in this talk at the very top of all these these things there was famine

1076
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:26,450
in the end of the day or help in order not to model

1077
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,190
how do we set

1078
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:32,610
OK well we did a paper recently which is our best proposal are probably the

1079
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:37,050
best way to do this which is to not be the empirical bayesian

1080
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:41,570
the religious bayesian answer to set hyperparameters is the always try to read over them

1081
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:45,490
in the way you do that you introduce hyper hyperparameters distribution

1082
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:48,300
after a reasonable thing to do but often hard

1083
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,150
but in this case it really is very appealing because

1084
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:56,150
jenni is infinite for object and i'm going make up for usually with that you

1085
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:58,530
say that the galaxy with some unknown me

1086
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:03,320
in nineteen something very parametric inside the whole nonparametric thing so an alternative which is

1087
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:08,700
to be empirical bayesian is is kernel density estimation estimating not only sample that in

1088
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:12,130
these pages which are flying around you put in

1089
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:16,260
we can estimate the problem and get perfectly good

1090
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:21,780
turn key higher empirical bayes method no more free parameters anywhere

1091
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,220
OK so i have five

1092
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,050
all right so that was kind of a quick run-through i know several of you

1093
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:31,780
are working on this topic already this sort of bringing

1094
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,400
coal to newcastle

1095
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:39,360
but i hope that those you who are not aware that she found interesting to

1096
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:42,690
appreciate what is to be nonparametric bayesian

1097
01:07:42,950 --> 01:07:49,550
my before the war that was going to be nonparametric bayesian nonparametric parameters

1098
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:53,420
the considering the nearest neighbour that this and they didn't have to have other conjugate

1099
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,820
priors gaussians are for

1100
01:07:55,820 --> 01:08:02,420
with increasing quite ten is asian this temperature strongly ship towards higher values

1101
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:07,260
here you see the complete phase diagram

1102
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:12,720
of the same suffix just changing the ph value of this is the non ionic

1103
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:15,990
this is the ionic system

1104
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:20,780
u which change in the existence region of the mexican

1105
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:24,430
what's the idea behind this

1106
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:29,110
when we have such system and and when for example when we said at this

1107
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:37,070
of the non ionic system here in the so ution in the isotropic so ution

1108
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:40,010
we simply change the ph value

1109
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:41,860
and then we go into the

1110
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:46,720
exactly the case in other words here we have the interesting

1111
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:53,340
the situation that we can introduce the pace transformation by modifying the ph value of

1112
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:55,570
our solution

1113
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:03,740
what do we expect when we have such a network exec and nearly order polymer

1114
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,260
as we have seen from the diagram

1115
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:11,180
we start with the pure isotropic

1116
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,680
one of the network

1117
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:15,340
we can swear the parliament network

1118
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:20,550
then we have the first transformation from the isotropic network into the exact second the

1119
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:25,630
phase and that we should again have these interaction

1120
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:31,800
between chain confirmation infrastructure here we have brought like aggregates in other words we should

1121
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:36,340
observe and elongation one direction shrinkage into the other direction

1122
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:40,360
ending up with such an organization

1123
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:45,320
when we have our exec interface and when we additionally it water in other words

1124
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,180
when we go in this direction

1125
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:54,450
we should expect that the cylinder will only swell in one dimension

1126
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:56,820
given by this slow

1127
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:59,220
but the length of the cylinder

1128
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,700
should stay constant

1129
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:02,610
in other words

1130
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:07,970
such a strong and isotropy in the swelling behavior

1131
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:11,050
jump in the dimension and then this

1132
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:15,380
two dimension as

1133
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:18,920
here are one results

1134
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:24,510
we observe this behavior we observe the anisotropy we observe such as low

1135
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:26,880
here's some of the

1136
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:31,660
which is simply due and can be explained by defects of the example of structure

1137
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:34,610
in other words highly interesting system

1138
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:37,470
well you can also

1139
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,110
the mechanics by

1140
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:46,340
variation of the water content of the creation of the

1141
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,510
here one

1142
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:55,130
nice experiments from the network if we look at the links

1143
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,180
as function of time when we have some hydrochloric acid

1144
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:07,010
huge changes in the dimension of huge large changes in the dimension parallel and perpendicular

1145
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:08,240
to the director

1146
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:11,490
which are determined by the diffusion of the system

1147
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:17,530
what can we do with such high projects for example one idea was

1148
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:21,680
an old idea originally from

1149
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:26,280
given in austria

1150
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:30,400
he said why not making bifocals

1151
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:33,510
lands from liquid crystal elastomers

1152
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:38,990
or a an optical about focus contact lens

1153
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:44,920
the optical axis of the uniaxial crystal is parallel to the surface of such

1154
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:46,320
then you have to

1155
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,820
refractive powers

1156
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:57,300
which is which can be used for example for positive people similar to these

1157
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:59,930
classes having two

1158
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,740
refractive powers

1159
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:07,110
can be done with our elastomers you

1160
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:13,820
such a high liquid crystal and has had which which is microscopically uniformly or with

1161
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:18,700
the optical axis in this direction and which is

1162
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:23,930
as these by focal optical properties i think it's the perfect solution

1163
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:30,050
unfortunately or and i should say that also industry is highly interested was highly interested

1164
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:35,510
in this topic unfortunately it's simply too expensive

1165
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:42,450
but nevertheless let me summarize so far with the second part of my lecture i

1166
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:47,650
think i could give you a very brief introduction that all these principles that are

1167
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:55,970
valid for the thermotropic liquid crystalline elastomers the interplay between chain confirmation structure also holds

1168
01:12:55,970 --> 01:13:00,610
but the convergence would be very very slow and in particular you want get a

1169
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,030
central limit theorem

1170
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:05,960
so you get this tumor which is very poor so this is something that must

1171
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:10,220
be remembered that when you pick a function g

1172
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:13,600
once again you want a function g which which has

1173
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:14,840
heavy tailed

1174
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:21,210
if is the tower to defend then you can get into trouble for functions h

1175
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:27,620
so i decided to say set of

1176
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:31,070
examples just in included that one

1177
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:35,290
right now is not in notes

1178
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:38,180
we get a very nice example and found that

1179
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,830
this is the most realistic problems

1180
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:43,750
again we have a cushy

1181
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:49,740
inferential problems we have ten observations from the cushy

1182
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,710
this ten observations

1183
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:59,110
the density while one person x minus either square and we don't see here

1184
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:04,170
we put flat prior on theta the the posterior e the likelihood

1185
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,420
this is the same thing

1186
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:12,740
approximate the posterior distribution on c to

1187
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:15,780
we want to compute the posterior expectations

1188
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:22,630
so in general multiplied with the likelihood associated with the ten observations we something which

1189
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:23,970
is very silly

1190
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:25,460
which is the

1191
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,050
new ones

1192
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,770
so we simulate

1193
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:32,660
sample of feeders from the normal

1194
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:34,230
mu one

1195
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,910
for instance we use

1196
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:41,570
one thousand

1197
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,800
generations from the normal

1198
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:47,480
new one and this graph represents

1199
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:52,330
the effect of the choice of

1200
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:54,790
OK i started by simulated

1201
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:56,430
they simulating my ten

1202
01:14:56,590 --> 01:15:01,200
cushing observation so i chose theoretical view

1203
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:03,880
and i see made ten

1204
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:04,900
co she is

1205
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,630
and i have posted distribution

1206
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:13,260
on the side the ten coaches and when i was new close to zero

1207
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:17,410
this graph represents the range

1208
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:21,110
my estimations

1209
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:27,890
five hundred applications of my importance sampling approximations and you can see that the range

1210
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:29,600
it is fairly

1211
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:32,500
restricted to new

1212
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:37,400
call one point five to two OK the you the pink

1213
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:41,070
ranges does the ninety five percent range

1214
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:43,080
but as new

1215
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,630
get away

1216
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,520
from the which is close the true value

1217
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:49,730
you can see the

1218
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:53,780
first generation degeneracy in the scope

1219
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:58,430
or in the range of of the estimation as new increases it gets larger and

1220
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:03,290
larger but worse after a while like when you is equal to

1221
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:09,930
mister nations form i five hundred applications do not even get

1222
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:11,410
to the true value

1223
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:13,720
this is that because of the normal

1224
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:19,740
one unit equal two

1225
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,420
the musical two far i have lot trouble to reach something close to zero and

1226
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:27,400
therefore his gets away

1227
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:30,790
the y axis

1228
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:35,360
is nice to their seat ahead

1229
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,450
so this is the approximation

1230
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:40,400
to the posterior expectation

1231
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:44,110
OK so why try to approximate is

1232
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,810
then to wealthy

1233
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:51,690
product from i cycle one to ten of one of the one person x on

1234
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:54,140
minus e square

1235
01:16:55,200 --> 01:17:00,420
divided by the same thing with those this year

1236
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:09,110
and because

1237
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:12,560
i feel that i cannot i cannot compute that numerically

1238
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:14,860
what they use instead

1239
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:19,720
the importance sampling estimator mary which is the song

1240
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:22,230
from one to t

1241
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:24,640
also see on

1242
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:27,450
product of one class x

1243
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,410
my last you i

1244
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:36,070
and i divide by the normal distributions therefore multiply by the

1245
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:39,850
new minus cedar i

1246
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,190
and then the numerator is the same it's e

1247
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:49,330
mu minus edi i square

1248
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,270
divided by the the product of one class xk

1249
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:54,730
minus i

1250
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,370
and those you are are i i d

1251
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,400
no more you want

1252
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:04,300
and of course as you

1253
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:07,000
increases and i see that

1254
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,150
estimated from the normal

1255
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:11,570
santa a new

1256
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:14,310
so i knew it follows from the road

1257
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,340
i get less and less point

1258
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:20,930
in the region of interest and this is the recovery

1259
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:23,040
very well if you can see he

1260
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:27,780
so this is an example of finished there was an infinite violence because of this

1261
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,660
e to the new iris it i call

1262
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:37,230
just this creates an exploring factor and this tumor is is really poor and well

1263
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:39,400
of course this is an example of that

1264
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,220
since she

1265
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:48,530
and this is

1266
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:53,050
no none reputation

1267
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:54,840
so my here

1268
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:59,480
is that a minimum of five

1269
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:05,720
i created five hundred replications of that

1270
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:08,060
and the range i obtained is given

1271
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,750
by these black

1272
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,970
that kind of inference

1273
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:17,360
is this work

1274
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:19,340
i hope

1275
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:24,020
it's like on its like

1276
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:26,120
it's blinking

1277
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:31,670
i don't think it's amplifying

1278
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:10,530
well i should tell it not to sleep can

1279
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:18,570
OK i'm going to talk about the state of

1280
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:23,010
how i see artificial intelligence and

1281
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:25,900
what i think we should do about it

1282
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:30,680
i'll start by

1283
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:34,780
i'm suggesting that it's actually an emergency

1284
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:38,540
and that sometime in the next twenty or fifty years

1285
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,010
we're going to need

1286
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:44,900
really smart machines

1287
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:46,700
because there will be

1288
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,640
enough people to do

1289
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:50,650
all the work

1290
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:55,230
as you probably know

1291
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,340
life expectancy

1292
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:05,210
of people has been increasing about one year every four

1293
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:08,280
for the last fifty odd years

1294
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:13,630
this is probably going to keep happening and

1295
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,970
maybe even speed up

1296
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:18,970
so that a person born today

1297
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:22,370
has a life expectancy of about one hundred

1298
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:25,530
whereas in nineteen fifty it was

1299
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,560
seventy five or eighty

1300
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:35,350
with luck general health will also

1301
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:38,590
improve so that

1302
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:40,250
this doesn't just mean

1303
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:42,750
more and more years of being

1304
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:47,350
more or less disabled

1305
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:51,210
but anyway at some point we're also going to

1306
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:55,250
i have to reach some kind of equilibrium in population

1307
01:21:55,620 --> 01:22:00,840
so that when people start to live for two hundred years

1308
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,660
and typically there will be

1309
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:10,130
one fifteen year-old child for each one hundred fifty year-old adult

1310
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:12,400
and that will be enough

1311
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:15,220
to supply the infrastructure and

1312
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:19,000
all the other things that we're accustomed to now now

1313
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,370
course with the industrial revolution

1314
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:23,930
the number of

1315
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:28,750
people hours to make a product started to decrease

1316
01:22:29,530 --> 01:22:33,080
in some areas it hasn't increased very much

1317
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:42,120
there's some strange kind of theory that the

1318
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:46,280
you can solve some of the problems of supporting the old people

1319
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,780
by savings

1320
01:22:47,870 --> 01:22:50,870
but as far as i can see that's meaningless

1321
01:22:50,930 --> 01:22:55,580
because having money is no use unless their workers to pay

1322
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:58,460
to do things

1323
01:22:58,530 --> 01:22:59,990
with it

1324
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:02,220
and so the idea of

1325
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:06,650
beefing up the social security fund and so forth

1326
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:11,280
so that people will have in comes in the future

1327
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,760
it's just simply a big mistake

1328
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:21,020
money is no use unless there are people who want it

1329
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:26,220
now we have a certain amount of automation

1330
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:34,230
so that lots of parts of cars are made automatically

1331
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,770
and some devices are assembled automatically

1332
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,770
a couple of years ago i was

1333
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,280
visiting the roland company in hamamatsu japan

1334
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:49,360
and where they make keyboards and plotters

1335
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:51,240
music keyboards

1336
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,650
which incidentally they don't sell in japan because

1337
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,100
yamaha is in neighbour

1338
01:23:58,030 --> 01:24:01,520
they're very polite about not competing with their neighbour

1339
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:04,260
so roland keyboards are

1340
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,140
only sold

1341
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:12,910
so they took me on the planet and there was no one there

1342
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:19,850
it was all there was also part making

1343
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:25,350
and there was nobody in the plotter factory either

1344
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,940
but at the exit

1345
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:32,700
there was a roland plotter and a

1346
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:35,960
i think with hewlett packard plotters these are

1347
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:38,460
big six foot things

1348
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:43,630
each plotter came out of the assembly line and plotted something

1349
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:46,460
and there was a person who would compare

1350
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:49,260
its plot with hewlett-packard plot

1351
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,420
and if it didn't look as good he would send it back

1352
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,330
so that was there

1353
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:57,950
quality control person

1354
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,910
and as i remember he was the only one in the place

1355
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:04,270
at the moment

1356
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,940
there aren't any machines that can fix your car like

1357
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,520
change the spark plugs or

1358
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:16,260
make even minor repairs

1359
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:17,140
and so

1360
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:21,460
so we don't have any automation for maintenance of things

1361
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,410
i suppose because maintenance means

1362
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:27,460
something happened that wasn't expected

1363
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,230
and so you need

1364
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,940
anywhere from very small two

1365
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:36,050
very large degree of resourcefulness and

1366
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,280
adaptability and so for us to understand the situation

1367
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,830
correct what's wrong

1368
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:47,640
so we don't have any automation to speak of

1369
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,840
of customized work

1370
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,950
it's it is going to be a meeting

1371
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,660
here in

1372
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:57,650
three or four weeks

1373
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:02,670
the subject of mass customization

1374
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:05,130
and mass customization

1375
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:06,920
it means how do you measure

1376
01:26:06,940 --> 01:26:11,140
clothing that will actually fit customers and that sort of thing

1377
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,770
from the manufacturing point of view

1378
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:20,090
i don't think that's a serious problem

1379
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:22,140
if you can make it suited all

1380
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:23,700
then by

1381
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:27,050
fancy programming you ought to be able to make one that

1382
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:31,170
is slightly different for each customer and so forth

1383
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:34,090
on the other hand if you terriers suit

1384
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:35,530
or shirt

1385
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,740
i don't think there's any

1386
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:41,090
machine that can so it up together yet

1387
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:44,700
how can we solve that problem

1388
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:47,530
by making machines that have

1389
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:50,150
a large degree of common sense and

1390
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:54,780
resourcefulness and great deal of knowledge about how to do things

1391
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:57,460
and fairly dextrous hands are

1392
01:26:57,470 --> 01:27:00,030
the equivalent

1393
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:05,170
but at the moment nothing like that is happening anywhere in the world

1394
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:09,460
what's more

1395
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:13,290
of course i would have to upperbound it but this is something which is the

1396
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:17,650
property of the plant

1397
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:21,380
so the

1398
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:25,990
the final term like this chaining of the log and this is all an estimate

1399
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:29,490
of the geometry but it could be a good one or bad one and you

1400
01:27:29,490 --> 01:27:32,960
don't know if you if you met but this is the best

1401
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:36,260
you can get totally different balance of different people can get the results of the

1402
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:40,240
same class because the knowledge out as

1403
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:42,150
you know how

1404
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,430
one thing that tells you that you're right is that you if you look

1405
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:51,990
for example

1406
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:56,460
the expected value of the supremum of

1407
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,420
the difference between

1408
01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:00,590
the true and empirical

1409
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:04,630
this is more or less what these bonds are trying to

1410
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:07,410
there are two

1411
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:09,170
estimate how far

1412
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:11,330
these things are deviating

1413
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:14,170
over the class

1414
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:16,080
so that that

1415
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:17,270
this quantity here

1416
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:18,440
which depends

1417
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,440
on the class

1418
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:22,170
and depends on the distribution

1419
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:26,390
we can prove that its upper and lower bounded by

1420
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:30,460
you know one is the training ground

1421
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:34,330
with some constants c one and c two here

1422
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:36,990
so what this means is that

1423
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,210
this tuning in capture the right

1424
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:42,710
at least the right rate of convergence of these two zero as n goes to

1425
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,330
so this is approved that

1426
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:48,560
this is

1427
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,750
now it's true that it depends on how well you

1428
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:59,350
compute or upper bound is covering numbers because then

1429
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:03,620
it is log and and but you still have to compute

1430
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,450
and you may have

1431
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:07,680
good or bad provides on the end

1432
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:09,600
but again you can

1433
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:14,790
in some cases you can prove that for example for VC classes

1434
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:16,200
you can prove that

1435
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:20,540
it's a good estimate or i mean

1436
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,330
it's not exactly b but

1437
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:27,200
say that covering number

1438
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:32,620
at five eps that's register epsilon is something like epsilon minus one of the

1439
01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:36,020
and this

1440
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:38,830
i mean it's not inequality is an upper bound but you can see that you

1441
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:42,890
can prove that it's an upper and lower bounds which means you have within some

1442
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:47,350
you have a good estimate of the current so

1443
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:49,020
what i'm saying is that

1444
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:53,020
all this one it is always hard to upper bound them precisely

1445
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,350
you can improve the

1446
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,600
at each step you get the right rate

1447
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:59,500
don't get the right value with

1448
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:11,520
asymptotically they are correct

1449
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,660
given the data

1450
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,600
a bayesian approach but also

1451
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:17,180
converge to the correct

1452
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:20,950
and in some sense because the priors easily overwhelmed

1453
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:22,770
and in many cases

1454
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,410
they can also talk about

1455
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:27,730
five becomes one

1456
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:28,470
and it seems like

1457
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:30,810
this is a house

1458
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:40,270
what you can prove in the vision contd

1459
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:44,160
the question if the question is

1460
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,680
in the bayesian case you can prove that

1461
01:30:46,730 --> 01:30:51,970
after why the prior is washed away have enough data then you can

1462
01:30:51,970 --> 01:30:54,990
you know you converge to the true thing no matter what your priorities

1463
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,770
and you can even get results about how fast this happens and how does this

1464
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:08,970
relate to

1465
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:10,390
yes yes yes

1466
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:11,640
for the

1467
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,680
i mean this convergence is consistency

1468
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:15,560
focus on the prior

1469
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,600
does with weight on all the functions that they that covered the entire

1470
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,750
yes i mean

1471
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:29,180
i mean depends what kind of analysis you doing the baiting is

1472
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:32,600
but one thing is not i mean you can apply all these two

1473
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:35,910
bayesian algorithm that finds

1474
01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:40,790
you have your prior you look at how fast the converges

1475
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:43,410
and you can derive the same kind of results

1476
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:48,020
you can have consistency but you cannot have rates of convergence to the true though

1477
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:51,730
right because you have an opinion here and so that the number is also body

1478
01:31:51,950 --> 01:31:53,560
big picture

1479
01:31:53,770 --> 01:31:56,830
just a lot of how you want it and i think

1480
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:01,390
you know you have to make the distinction between

1481
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:07,040
bayesian algorithms or algorithm that are based on the you know using a probabilistic prior

1482
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,310
using bayes rule to make two

1483
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:11,930
to update the prior

1484
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:14,660
so that's the bayesian algorithm but then there is

1485
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:17,160
the bayesian analysis of algorithms

1486
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:23,100
where instead of looking at the worst case scenario is you're looking at the average

1487
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:28,430
case so where everything that every statement that you make in the bayesian analysis

1488
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:29,700
it would be

1489
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:36,060
on under the expectations over the prior over sampling the function according to the prior

1490
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:40,490
but these are two different things vision algorithms can very well be analysed in that

1491
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:48,890
svms can very well be analyzed under expectation over some over some prior

1492
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,770
and the kind of result that you're being with bayesian analysis are

1493
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:56,250
that same year but they something different because

1494
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:57,680
you can't really

1495
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:00,830
i mean to tell you something on average over something

1496
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:02,890
prior sampling

1497
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:06,290
doesn't really tell you something about the problem that you're looking at

1498
01:33:07,450 --> 01:33:10,700
it's just average over a set of problems and you want see get to see

1499
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,660
just one problem

1500
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:16,390
but it mean that you can derive something from the average

1501
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:19,670
i don't know if it's a matter of choice but again it can give you

1502
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:21,250
some guidance but doesn't

1503
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:24,080
justify really something for your specific problem

1504
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,160
just like

1505
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:29,140
you know these mounds they are probabilistic in nature that there is something about the

1506
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:32,230
distribution over all possible training said that would sample

1507
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:35,870
but for this particular training set that you observe

1508
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:38,910
maybe it's true maybe it's much true maybe you're exactly in the case where the

1509
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:41,430
boundaries will finally right

1510
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:44,720
but you can circumvent that

1511
01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:49,330
you know looking at this and setting that i mentioned before the only thing where

1512
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:51,100
you don't even have this issue

1513
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:55,000
probabilistic bounds to me about

1514
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:06,910
in practice we cannot get rid of prior and we always used by your friends

1515
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:13,180
dealing with practical problem and i always wonder how much i came from the prior

1516
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,830
and how much they came from the data

1517
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:19,660
and the if the valid question again

1518
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:23,620
because hearing with very very

1519
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:34,910
OK so

1520
01:34:34,970 --> 01:34:38,450
what you did this question is perfectly fine by to you

1521
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:40,770
have your prior assumptions and

1522
01:34:40,830 --> 01:34:42,100
you have your data

1523
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,700
and of course

1524
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:47,830
so i'm going to talk a little bit about the fitting of the perceptron but

1525
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:52,160
importantly it was based on a really simple model of the neuron from nineteen forty

1526
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:58,570
three and a learning algorithm for how the neuron worked

1527
01:34:58,590 --> 01:35:03,310
now later machine learning research so has gone from that those sort of simple

1528
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:06,020
perhaps neurally inspired models

1529
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:11,670
theoretical foundations of such models such questions is their capacity to learn and i think

1530
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:15,880
a real sort of example of that is you know that nick's work on statistical

1531
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:21,250
learning theory is not part i follow but it's extremely theoretical very mathematical and it

1532
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:22,480
doesn't really care

1533
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:32,290
when learning algorithm has any basis in the brain it's just about learning algorithms

1534
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:37,840
my personal view is the machine learning benefited really greatly by incorporating on some ideas

1535
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,280
from psychology

1536
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:43,750
but not being afraid to incorporate rigorous theory so

1537
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:44,950
and i do credit

1538
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:48,630
in particular when i think about the people around before i was around and look

1539
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:53,880
at the community before i was around i don't think people like michael jordan geoff

1540
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:58,040
hinton they were in this parallel distributed processing research group

1541
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:02,740
sort of i guess in the early eighties and that was very

1542
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:04,770
i guess psychologically based

1543
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:10,790
the algorithms they came out with were inspired by thinking about how the brain works

1544
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:14,320
but what i think is very impressive so it's easy to say disable we're going

1545
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:17,770
to do something on computers and we're gonna be inspired by the brain and we're

1546
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:22,280
going to do sort of learning or you could sort of look more recent things

1547
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:28,200
like similar life for genetic algorithms all these different things inspired by evolution let's do

1548
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,600
it let's do evolution does

1549
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:33,950
i think machine learning in some sense is slightly different because

1550
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:39,350
i think it's been far less afraid of very very strong theory and very very

1551
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:43,190
strong mathematics and very open to receiving that i think a lot of the credit

1552
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:48,520
of that goes to people like michael jordan definition through early on when physicists theoretical

1553
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:51,030
physicists came in and said all

1554
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:54,710
the model you've got of the brain is actually a spin glass and you can

1555
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:59,020
do this analysis they didn't run away saying that's just theory we're interested results they

1556
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:03,500
embrace that and those people are still in the community today and i think that

1557
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:08,020
you really see that reflected in the machine learning community the diversity from people who

1558
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:11,080
are very interested in just the theory

1559
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:12,180
i have no

1560
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:17,460
concerns about whether this what humans do may not even have any concerns about whether

1561
01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:18,610
their models

1562
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:25,120
work in particular applications to people who are only interested applications have no concerns about

1563
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:30,200
whether this is how humans learn to people who are interested in humans learning

1564
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:34,330
and it basically has covered all those things i think it's very important that continues

1565
01:37:34,330 --> 01:37:38,190
to cover all those things because it benefits from that mix

1566
01:37:38,410 --> 01:37:42,520
of people in this is a lot about what i think this is the summer

1567
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:47,850
school is about is partially about remaking that connection

1568
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:54,520
one of the things happened is

1569
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:58,540
machine learning people get accused of distorting lousy statistics

1570
01:37:58,550 --> 01:38:03,570
because one of the results of this research is is is the work we did

1571
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:08,300
does work well on things are traditionally considered to be statistical applications

1572
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:15,940
machine learning i think was viewed with some skepticism by statisticians because they saw it

1573
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:18,090
as soon as sloppy statistics

1574
01:38:18,110 --> 01:38:19,950
now i'm glad to say

1575
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:28,630
modern machine learning and statistics interact to both communities benefits so if i go

1576
01:38:28,690 --> 01:38:33,830
and visits so recently we had chris holmes visits group in

1577
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:39,160
manchester he's leading bayesian statistician you know and chris simms when we're talking about their

1578
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:44,050
applications were interested we have entirely overlapping ideas we think very much the same thing

1579
01:38:44,050 --> 01:38:48,950
we use very similar models very similar techniques some of those techniques are now coming

1580
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:54,300
from the machine learning community in particular variational methods and i must admit that i

1581
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:58,830
was falling into the trap one stage thinking what is machine learning just an extension

1582
01:38:58,830 --> 01:39:00,570
of statistics

1583
01:39:00,610 --> 01:39:04,440
are we just sort of modern statistics people with

1584
01:39:04,450 --> 01:39:10,400
perhaps sexier applications in video and stuff like that and i guess i started getting

1585
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:13,780
persuaded by the argument

1586
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:17,710
i'm going to offend people maybe when i say some of the things i'll say

1587
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:23,700
that i'll continue anyway don't feel too offended if you're statisticians statistics this i didn't

1588
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:29,340
really feel counter this because to me statistics was the most boring part of all

1589
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:36,920
i remember the doing maths at the age of sixteen and statistics was

1590
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:40,800
let's some of these numbers to compute the mean OK and i can remember that

1591
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,020
the idea

1592
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:45,440
OK so this is the last little step but i have to do i to

1593
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:50,690
make sure that my function somehow has something to do with the interest

1594
01:39:50,710 --> 01:39:55,130
so how do we do learning in these things

1595
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:59,750
OK so so so now we have to do some some inference so we already

1596
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:04,050
looked at the slide this the how to do inference in in in a parametric

1597
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:12,030
and we also looked at the the bayesian inference here so again what what normally

1598
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:13,110
happens in

1599
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:18,530
in parametric models of our model is now in the nonparametric model normally happens here

1600
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:22,670
is that you put a prior on the weights that you construct the

1601
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:24,320
the posterior over the weights

1602
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:26,210
and then you

1603
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:27,550
use posterior

1604
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:30,920
two to compute the things that you are interested in it and you interested in

1605
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:32,650
making predictions

1606
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:38,000
so that's an integral over the posterior distribution or you might be introduced interested in

1607
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,460
the marginal likelihood

1608
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:41,280
much like being the the

1609
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:45,940
the product of the prior and the likelihood is the unnormalized posterior so again it's

1610
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:48,260
it's an integral over the posterior distribution

1611
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:51,980
we can also do

1612
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:55,740
we can also compute the probability of the model if we have different different sets

1613
01:40:55,740 --> 01:41:01,530
of models and indeed this is what we what we going do now the problem

1614
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:07,500
here is that for most interesting models these schools are intractable so we can't actually

1615
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:08,920
compute what's going on

1616
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:14,840
but interestingly gas process are tractable an interesting class of models we can exactly do

1617
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:15,900
those intervals

1618
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:19,360
so how does that work now firstly

1619
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:22,250
this a little bit of a problem here right because where the weights

1620
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:24,730
i just saying well we're just using

1621
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:29,000
prior over functions and then we have some data but it also tells you something

1622
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,020
about what the function is and then we're supposed to combine those those two

1623
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:37,300
but how do we apply this methodology when and

1624
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:40,730
what like where where the parameters like where the model here

1625
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:44,050
so it turns out that

1626
01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:50,250
the the right answer to that question is that the parameters in our model is

1627
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:52,670
the function itself

1628
01:41:52,730 --> 01:41:54,630
OK that sounds

1629
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:59,480
that sounds a little bit weird right but what we're doing inference over is just

1630
01:42:01,210 --> 01:42:06,380
and so if we plug into our usual framework if you just plug in every

1631
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:10,250
time saw the parameters before we just taking the function and let's see what happens

1632
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:14,860
after all we want to do inference about the function and the likelihood tells you

1633
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:19,030
something about what the function is doing in the prior to tell you something about

1634
01:42:19,110 --> 01:42:21,210
what the function is doing

1635
01:42:21,230 --> 01:42:25,630
OK so we have so so we have the same ingredients as before we just

1636
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:29,420
turn the crank on what we're supposed to be doing so so what about the

1637
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:33,460
likelihood function so we have again gauss the likelihood function

1638
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:38,860
the like function tells you what's the probability of the observed data given

1639
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:41,420
the parameters so now that would be

1640
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:46,230
and we're not modelling the input here is that the probability of the royal society

1641
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:50,730
to change notation so this is shorthand for p of the thing that says is

1642
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:55,980
the conditional probability and right the PC more everything i write down the probabilities

1643
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,940
if not a piece missing

1644
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:04,630
so so the likelihood function is the probability of the data given the parameters

1645
01:43:04,650 --> 01:43:06,090
so let's write that down

1646
01:43:06,090 --> 01:43:08,130
so the probability of the data

1647
01:43:08,130 --> 01:43:12,420
in the end we only interested in modeling output it's probably the outputs given the

1648
01:43:12,420 --> 01:43:14,420
data the data is now the function

1649
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:19,000
OK so now i condition on the function put in f f of x and

1650
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,130
what is that thing well the likelihood tells us something about if the true function

1651
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:27,610
is something then what's the probability of observing the thing that you actually observed

1652
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:32,650
and that's if the if the noise that depends on the noise assumption about the

1653
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:37,550
noise assumption is calcium that says well then that the likelihood that probability is going

1654
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:42,630
to be proportional to e to the minus the distance between the actual function and

1655
01:43:42,630 --> 01:43:44,610
the observed value

1656
01:43:44,630 --> 01:43:49,690
so that this is going to be

1657
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:54,170
so so the question was

1658
01:43:54,250 --> 01:43:56,360
the vision

1659
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,780
the the

1660
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:06,300
so so what may be maybe this is the wrong the likelihood function is the

1661
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:09,300
probability of the data given the parameters

1662
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:13,860
OK and now we we've we've now substituting the function for the parameters in the

1663
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:18,750
probability of the data is it's only the upper part that we really modelling so

1664
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,230
sorry if i if i said that wrong

1665
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:27,420
OK so something interesting happens here right because we actually only the likelihood function is

1666
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:32,340
only interested in what the function does at the locations where we have data

1667
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:37,030
right it's and it doesn't say it doesn't actually depend on what the function does

1668
01:44:37,050 --> 01:44:39,190
out here where there was no data

1669
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:40,590
right so i know

1670
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:44,820
although when we write it down it looks as though the likelihood function cares about

1671
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:48,420
what the function does everywhere that happens not to be the case but it actually

1672
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:52,800
only depends on what the function is doing at the places where we are where

1673
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,380
we made observations

1674
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:59,260
OK so the so the likelihood function actually only depends on the values of x

1675
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:03,190
at the input locations are use boldface x f

1676
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:07,650
as a vector of those of those f

1677
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:14,750
and this is just to show the shorthand notation for for gas distribution so that

1678
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:21,030
the gas in here is centered on the left and it has whatever the observation

1679
01:45:23,110 --> 01:45:24,960
the likelihood function yes

1680
01:45:25,030 --> 01:45:28,210
so what we see now do we

1681
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:31,570
the in the

1682
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,820
are three

1683
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:38,440
here just mean i just mean what the function is actually the function is unknown

1684
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:42,300
just like the parameters are unknown when we're doing inference so this is just you

1685
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:45,360
can just think of this as being sort of an an abstract notation for the

1686
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:46,840
stuff that we don't know

1687
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:49,000
we don't know what it is right

1688
01:45:49,050 --> 01:45:50,090
but we do know

1689
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:56,530
that if the places where we have observations f should be close to those observations

1690
01:45:56,550 --> 01:46:02,070
OK so now we have to put a prior on our on our parameters right

1691
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:04,090
now propositional function

1692
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:09,730
but luckily we know how to put distributions over functions right so let's put against

1693
01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:12,320
process prior on the functions so

1694
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:16,210
all prime here is the probability of the parameters given the

1695
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:18,750
OK so

1696
01:46:18,810 --> 01:46:22,350
so we'd like to do is is trying to analyse poker

1697
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:26,000
using this notion of minimax optimality and we like to see

1698
01:46:26,010 --> 01:46:27,400
you know there's a lot of different

1699
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:32,230
issues that come up in poker things like blood thing grandstands where you act like

1700
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:34,070
you have a stronger hand and you really do

1701
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:39,260
or underpinning where you actually you weaker and and you really do you might ask

1702
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:43,010
are these issues solely kind of

1703
01:46:43,030 --> 01:46:46,050
human psychology issues or are they

1704
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:48,610
so the mathematical issues

1705
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:50,760
and i think the answer is there both

1706
01:46:50,810 --> 01:46:53,980
but there weak we can analyse years at least show

1707
01:46:54,010 --> 01:46:57,610
that they are mathematical issues as well as whatever social

1708
01:46:57,690 --> 01:46:59,650
you know were sort of

1709
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:00,840
psychology issues

1710
01:47:01,450 --> 01:47:05,300
so we can take a simple game and said the are minimax optimal strategies will

1711
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:09,790
see they will in fact two bluffing and two underfitting

1712
01:47:09,830 --> 01:47:12,300
OK so here's a

1713
01:47:12,310 --> 01:47:15,650
let me just described in this game which is kind of the simplest version of

1714
01:47:15,650 --> 01:47:20,190
poker that has the kind of

1715
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:22,400
ninety with poker is that there's some

1716
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:25,680
lack of knowledge and you have what the other player and if you don't know

1717
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:29,040
exactly what the other players hand was it would be very interesting game

1718
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:34,320
so is the simplest version that's just repeat the setting this three cards

1719
01:47:34,350 --> 01:47:35,710
two players

1720
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:38,960
and the players ante and the dollar

1721
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:40,770
OK so

1722
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:45,850
how many dollars here but i have cookies

1723
01:47:46,150 --> 01:47:47,540
all right so

1724
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:50,460
god i five

1725
01:47:50,690 --> 01:47:56,050
right song with fifty cent game for each player antes and the dollar so the

1726
01:47:56,050 --> 01:47:58,040
part starts with results

1727
01:47:58,270 --> 01:47:59,980
and then

1728
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:02,570
HK one car to car

1729
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:06,400
and then if you're the player goes first

1730
01:48:07,290 --> 01:48:08,870
can the decide

1731
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:11,960
where you want that dollar pasta

1732
01:48:12,010 --> 01:48:15,990
if you decide to that dollars of course the person that even if all the

1733
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:18,020
faithful you get the part or

1734
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:19,940
they can put in

1735
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:23,770
human dollar and then so they can either they fold you get the part doesn't

1736
01:48:23,770 --> 01:48:27,550
matter where cards are if they play dollar to the house for large

1737
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:32,110
so you if you that the other player call a dollar to fall or you

1738
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:34,300
might choose not to that you might say well

1739
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:38,660
i'd rather not that and the second player gets to go the second player if

1740
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:42,470
you pass the second player can then decide well they can either pass is just

1741
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:45,830
the the anti and you just review your card

1742
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:47,150
before they can that

1743
01:48:47,170 --> 01:48:49,770
if they that bends back to you

1744
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:54,270
the first player so you can either call for years our fold and they get

1745
01:48:54,270 --> 01:48:55,530
the party

1746
01:48:55,550 --> 01:48:57,150
whatever it is you can't

1747
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:58,490
this of your

1748
01:48:58,490 --> 01:49:01,650
the mayor poker you kind make sense the very simple version

1749
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:07,430
does anybody know keep going back and forth which is just one

1750
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:12,120
you start eating cookies insectivorous OK so

1751
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:14,700
so there's the game

1752
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:20,700
and the high card wins if there's no fault there was falling whoever fold

1753
01:49:20,710 --> 01:49:25,250
max part two dollars that's not quite right that was caught on the next winningest

1754
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:29,020
and so those are positive and one of them which are the most you can

1755
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:31,240
win parameters to my

1756
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:33,960
you could when dollar twenty dollars

1757
01:49:33,970 --> 01:49:37,210
you could lose the dollar two dollars

1758
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:42,360
so there's again it so we could even play

1759
01:49:42,370 --> 01:49:43,020
you know

1760
01:49:43,030 --> 01:49:45,800
for bit but

1761
01:49:47,210 --> 01:49:49,770
we can write this matrix

1762
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:52,900
so the question how would you write is the matrix k so ution it i

1763
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:58,470
think about this because the rows are your strategy the colonies what the strategy in

1764
01:49:58,470 --> 01:49:59,770
this game

1765
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:01,970
so the strategy is

1766
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:05,710
what you're going to do

1767
01:50:05,870 --> 01:50:08,830
a complete specification program

1768
01:50:08,870 --> 01:50:13,550
a strategy arose like a program you are write computer programs to say what you

1769
01:50:13,550 --> 01:50:15,670
would do in every eventuality

1770
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:17,300
so here's an example

1771
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:21,680
OK so let me to forgiven car let's say your player and the player a

1772
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:25,870
is the first one i want to go for that so you

1773
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:30,620
you can decide

1774
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:34,320
for any given card what you're going to do so that i mean what you

1775
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:35,860
do is you pass

1776
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,030
by your phone

1777
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:39,250
if he chooses to bet

1778
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:43,590
that the possible strategies you might decide the forgiven card like two

1779
01:50:43,590 --> 01:50:45,650
i might pass but

1780
01:50:45,660 --> 01:50:47,480
the that snowfall

1781
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:51,590
or i could decide use them in the past

1782
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:54,600
but if the best thing

1783
01:50:54,650 --> 01:50:56,710
we can write such

1784
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:01,710
are right so well

1785
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:05,260
another strategy you could have forgiven card

1786
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:08,470
is you might pass

1787
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:12,980
but then called the that to be so so when you're going to advance think

1788
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:17,640
about what you're doing every eventuality you to write this down you give us two

1789
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:21,250
right this a computer program to play for you

1790
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:23,830
so you could say for any given car you want italics

1791
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:28,340
OK for this like the one and the case of the three possibility given card

1792
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:33,360
you could pass the ball with the bat the very weak strategy call past fold

1793
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:38,470
you could pass the color the that that's kind of intermediate strand you called call

1794
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:41,380
or you could that call

1795
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:45,830
and then there's nothing else to do the other player has to make a decision

1796
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:47,450
to the colony

1797
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:49,380
so reason three

1798
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:52,160
cards you can do one of these and so

1799
01:51:52,190 --> 01:51:53,600
there are

1800
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,870
about imagine movement

1801
01:51:55,870 --> 01:51:57,600
and how to control

1802
01:51:57,990 --> 01:51:59,470
BCI i

1803
01:51:59,470 --> 01:52:02,160
and how to transfer information

1804
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:04,830
i showed you

1805
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:07,080
why i discussed

1806
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:10,760
that there are some

1807
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:14,450
directions that are helping disabled

1808
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:21,010
so clinical applications i showed you want the arm is i discussed others from

1809
01:52:21,010 --> 01:52:23,430
the bombers that

1810
01:52:23,490 --> 01:52:26,930
and this the general issue of

1811
01:52:26,970 --> 01:52:29,490
human computer interaction

1812
01:52:31,430 --> 01:52:35,970
the games were some part of of the

1813
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:37,220
the story

1814
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:41,910
so so the idea is to have some signal that is not you know i

1815
01:52:41,910 --> 01:52:43,910
movement that is not

1816
01:52:43,930 --> 01:52:49,310
you know motor movement but something beyond that and you see what we can actually

1817
01:52:49,310 --> 01:52:54,280
do with it so it's an unexplored channel in the human machine interaction

1818
01:52:54,350 --> 01:52:57,280
and this we would like to explore

1819
01:52:58,390 --> 01:53:02,160
just to give you

1820
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:07,740
overview of what we want what we did so this is some something really is

1821
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:10,990
real and it is done with the with the car maker

1822
01:53:11,010 --> 01:53:21,200
i don't say who and and the goal here was the following so given that

1823
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:23,790
you're measure e g in the car

1824
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:26,060
can we actually

1825
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:28,580
find out what the workload

1826
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:31,200
to a certain driver is

1827
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:33,560
because if we would know that

1828
01:53:33,580 --> 01:53:34,760
we could

1829
01:53:34,780 --> 01:53:37,700
try to try to change the

1830
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:38,830
the driver

1831
01:53:38,850 --> 01:53:40,720
core into action

1832
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:44,510
just to make an example so if we would know that the workload is very

1833
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:48,450
four in the acoustic domain

1834
01:53:48,490 --> 01:53:51,620
we can easily get this with microphones but c

1835
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:55,490
with your brain signals some i mean even if you have loved music it might

1836
01:53:55,490 --> 01:53:59,790
not be high workload for you for you

1837
01:53:59,810 --> 01:54:04,910
in this in the sense of cognitive workload so

1838
01:54:05,490 --> 01:54:10,180
if we would have that and you navigation system starts talking to you there's no

1839
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:13,790
way you can you can really grasp what it says

1840
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:16,990
on and if you have already high workload and then you

1841
01:54:16,990 --> 01:54:19,220
might even have an accident

1842
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:21,200
so so one way is

1843
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:27,540
to use this information of of or detector and saying this too high workload here

1844
01:54:27,890 --> 01:54:30,470
let's shifted to another

1845
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:33,740
it's a visual input you

1846
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:36,390
projected onto the screen so this is

1847
01:54:36,430 --> 01:54:39,600
one of the very simple application

1848
01:54:41,450 --> 01:54:42,810
going to show it to you

1849
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:46,310
and they have to

1850
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:48,280
in this from

1851
01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:54,120
OK maybe

1852
01:54:54,240 --> 01:55:06,010
so there's an EEG trace running up there

1853
01:55:06,060 --> 01:55:10,540
and you see this several

1854
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:17,010
task the same time is the primary task driving this secondary task responding to write

1855
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:21,200
direct links which between right and left and you have to push left and right

1856
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:28,720
and then there is some some further tasks which are mental calculation

1857
01:55:28,780 --> 01:55:34,180
and listening to one two and mix of an audio book and news

1858
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:38,040
makers of these different different

1859
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:43,870
two ways of actually simulating high or low workload situation

1860
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:49,060
and so in this point in fact the

1861
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:54,390
the drivers doing some mental mental calculation task so so you can try to do

1862
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:56,910
it yourself so i give you number

1863
01:55:56,930 --> 01:55:59,850
seven hundred and fifty eight

1864
01:55:59,850 --> 01:56:02,290
and you subtract seventeen

1865
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:04,410
when you do that

1866
01:56:04,430 --> 01:56:06,410
for a while

1867
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,240
and you say

1868
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:12,580
you know you always say the numbers you're not allowed to to mumble

1869
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:17,390
and it's actually what you're driving and while you're doing all these sorts of things

1870
01:56:17,390 --> 01:56:19,020
it's quite

1871
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:21,720
tedious and so you could also

1872
01:56:21,740 --> 01:56:26,810
i have another mental calculation task which is subtracting three for example

1873
01:56:26,830 --> 01:56:29,410
and so you could distinguish between high and low

1874
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:31,850
calculation workload

1875
01:56:31,850 --> 01:56:33,810
and so if you

1876
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:36,490
you would do some kind of

1877
01:56:36,510 --> 01:56:41,100
the training set up which means that you drive the car go through some blocks

1878
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:46,780
of high and low workload of acoustic and and calculation

1879
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:53,080
and you try to to calibrate your classifiers to the individual to this particular task

1880
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:55,890
of detecting high and low workload

1881
01:56:55,910 --> 01:57:00,140
and and then you you just two and a real experiment and and see how

1882
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:01,950
good you are

1883
01:57:01,990 --> 01:57:05,990
and then

1884
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:08,830
mitigate the

1885
01:57:08,830 --> 01:57:17,680
OK so that six hundred fifty six so that was after a long period of

1886
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:21,450
calculation so

1887
01:57:21,490 --> 01:57:24,020
so you see that now the mental workload because

1888
01:57:24,040 --> 01:57:27,870
down for calculation because she has to do something

1889
01:57:27,950 --> 01:57:36,890
and you see the secondary task with the links always

1890
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:41,100
and i actually have to move to some

1891
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:42,260
o point where

1892
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:45,080
you can actually see

1893
01:57:56,910 --> 01:58:00,080
we just get the do

1894
01:58:03,490 --> 01:58:12,390
slide number video

1895
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:21,280
so this is just

1896
01:58:21,290 --> 01:58:28,640
the acoustic the story of news search certain news thing and also an audio book

1897
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:33,100
read and the subject is instructed to listen to either one to tell later on

1898
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:36,890
to what it is about so he has to fill out the form to tell

1899
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:40,970
you can so you can say what what

1900
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:45,810
we can find out

1901
01:58:45,830 --> 01:58:50,430
well i mean that it's makes it to make

1902
01:58:50,450 --> 01:58:51,950
about one of them

1903
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:01,970
i'm not sure

1904
01:59:01,970 --> 01:59:07,350
what the definition of a positive definite kernel in implies for this special case where

1905
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:10,430
you have only one point and only one crayfish

1906
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:14,960
and the problem is he already

1907
01:59:16,050 --> 01:59:17,380
in the handouts

1908
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:20,460
compute the determinant of the gram matrix

1909
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:24,480
and maybe are meant to him by saying

1910
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:27,030
since this is a positive definite matrix

1911
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:30,790
the determinant to be nonnegative

1912
01:59:30,810 --> 01:59:34,180
OK so the determinant of positive definite matrices nonnegative

1913
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:38,050
maybe many of you know this from linear algebra

1914
01:59:38,070 --> 01:59:40,910
so the determinant

1915
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:44,980
is nonnegative and for the last problem

1916
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:51,650
i'm just saying it's in it's implied by the problem

1917
01:59:51,670 --> 01:59:59,840
once you've proven three it should be relatively easy to prove for

1918
01:59:59,850 --> 02:00:01,910
OK so

1919
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:40,400
OK so there's a few herself solved also we get to the solutions now

1920
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:47,410
so again if you want you can some brownie points for the

1921
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:53,520
best student prize of this summer school is someone who would like to

1922
02:00:53,570 --> 02:00:57,200
present the solution of the second problem

1923
02:01:08,790 --> 02:01:20,770
all right

1924
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:24,400
the model

1925
02:01:47,540 --> 02:01:48,690
i mean

1926
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:10,460
it's you

1927
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:33,850
and then you

1928
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:37,540
as well

1929
02:02:37,590 --> 02:02:38,580
as well

1930
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:43,120
one of the school

1931
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:47,300
as long as go

1932
02:02:47,310 --> 02:02:48,470
and this

1933
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:53,010
is that what we

1934
02:02:54,270 --> 02:02:58,410
take your name means going through OK

1935
02:02:58,430 --> 02:03:02,110
so that's one point

1936
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:13,770
i think about was going to solve present problem number two

1937
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:30,510
so there was number three actually now we go back to number two positivity on

1938
02:03:30,510 --> 02:03:35,760
the diagonal someone who so this one

1939
02:03:45,350 --> 02:03:49,470
you can use new one

1940
02:04:15,070 --> 02:04:28,940
so just to let me know slight modification let's say

1941
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:31,550
this is true for all possible values of a

1942
02:04:31,690 --> 02:04:33,790
i'm going to have a to one

1943
02:04:33,870 --> 02:04:35,530
and then i can directly see

1944
02:04:35,540 --> 02:04:37,420
this great but

1945
02:04:37,450 --> 02:04:41,090
OK this is also i think you know what you think

1946
02:04:51,610 --> 02:04:58,020
OK so this again

1947
02:04:58,030 --> 02:05:01,970
she's using only a sum over one term so she has eight times a year

1948
02:05:01,970 --> 02:05:06,710
and then k of x and x and then with just saying since it has

1949
02:05:06,710 --> 02:05:10,770
to be nonnegative no matter what a we choose

1950
02:05:10,780 --> 02:05:15,990
by definition of a positive definite kernel that's just choose some a which is nonzero

1951
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,100
and then we can divide by a so points let's choose a one and then

1952
02:05:21,100 --> 02:05:26,890
directly we can see that k is positive or negative on the diagonal

1953
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:29,500
OK any questions about this one

1954
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:32,000
if not let's go to the last one

1955
02:05:32,250 --> 02:05:42,400
if you want to what this picture is that comes up in between it's picture

1956
02:05:42,410 --> 02:05:44,540
of the northern lights

1957
02:05:44,590 --> 02:05:47,640
and considering in the constellation of orion

1958
02:05:47,810 --> 02:05:53,670
OK so the last one vanishing diagonals so i can manage is on the diagonal

1959
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:56,340
it vanishes everywhere

1960
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:58,280
anyone want to

1961
02:05:58,290 --> 02:06:02,990
should this one

1962
02:06:04,410 --> 02:06:14,310
that's more

1963
02:06:14,330 --> 02:06:20,010
but OK so all right to use these things

1964
02:06:20,020 --> 02:06:23,210
OK i x x prime squared

1965
02:06:23,230 --> 02:06:25,650
it's smaller than

1966
02:06:25,740 --> 02:06:28,540
zero time zero

1967
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:31,830
so the square of the next prime minister

1968
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:35,930
smaller than smaller equal to zero because we also know that is larger or equal

1969
02:06:35,930 --> 02:06:38,020
to zero because of the square

1970
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:52,090
so it actually has to be able to zero

1971
02:06:52,210 --> 02:06:55,520
good morning
