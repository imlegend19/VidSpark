1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
in the

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,990
vocabulary of not an

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,480
and an implication

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:18,480
OK it's

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,060
the fundamental concept

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,020
with which we're dealing here

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,220
the notion of

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:36,550
a derivation

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,930
derivation of

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,810
a set of formulae

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:59,250
the derivation of the

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,490
from gamma is

13
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,320
by definition laying down stipulated

14
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,770
is finite

15
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,850
i one

16
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,110
two and

17
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,260
a formula

18
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,690
OK the one

19
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,880
well informed

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,380
such that

21
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,410
it's not just any finite sequence satisfy certain conditions

22
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,700
first of all

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,250
it gives is becoming specific derivation of the season to forget to include this one

24
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,250
and you try to prove you metatheorem and

25
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:54,610
you forget that is supposed to be derivation to be

26
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,930
in the sequence

27
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,300
i i

28
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,360
everyone necessary to illustrate the

29
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,720
it can be various things to everything in there is going to be justified in

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,270
some way

31
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,200
a member

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,910
of gamma

33
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,840
it's the derivation from gamma you're allowed to assume things in gamma

34
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,080
you're you're allowed those

35
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,240
an axiom of logic

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,140
tell you what that is

37
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,360
an immediate consequence

38
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,870
of formulae in

39
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:16,120
the set

40
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,400
i want

41
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,240
two a

42
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,950
i minus one that is

43
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,980
you can derive it in one step

44
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,000
from stuff this earlier in the sequence

45
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,980
the idea is you start your

46
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,720
throwing in your premises assumptions

47
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,320
you may one step inferences from that

48
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,420
extending this sequence until you get

49
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,370
o thing in deriving its

50
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,490
again kind of obviously what a derivation

51
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,470
linear derivation is

52
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,100
two things i haven't told you

53
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,910
what is an axiom of logic and what is immediate consequence

54
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:05,260
of course if you change if you take different definitions of axioms different definitions of

55
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,150
consequence you get different

56
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,080
so it's a valid derivations

57
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,610
we want to set up so that we get exactly the right classical

58
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,670
first order logic

59
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,980
there are many many ways of

60
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,980
doing that

61
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,170
formulating first order logic

62
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,120
so what's called a hilbert

63
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,520
calculus or fraga system

64
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,640
a couple of

65
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,940
logicians formulated logic like this in the early days

66
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:52,130
and i'm going to lay things down like this

67
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,670
we have infinitely many axioms

68
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,230
i'm not gonna write all

69
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,730
they are just to the all the instances of some scheme some formulas schemes

70
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,250
so the first one

71
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,620
is there any formula of the form

72
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,770
a implies b implies a

73
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,160
is an axiom

74
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,120
OK so

75
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,590
this is clearly a and b can be any

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,210
formulae here there are infinitely many different formerly plug for a and b whatever you

77
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,170
put in a is an axiom if it's about four

78
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,160
i don't speculate as to why

79
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,200
anything of that form should be thought to be logically correct

80
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,140
i just lay down that it is

81
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,750
the second one that i lay down

82
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,250
if a implies

83
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,840
b implies c

84
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,820
if a implies b as well

85
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,630
it implies c

86
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,750
another axiom scheme and again for any formula a b c in the language

87
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:33,700
and the third axiom scheme

88
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,110
if not a implies not be

89
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,690
then the

90
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,580
implies a

91
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:49,790
none of those essentially involve quantifiers

92
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,620
of course there are instances

93
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,850
formulae a and b may have quantifiers in that that's all right

94
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:03,220
but the connectives only the connectives are essentially involved

95
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,750
in the reasoning

96
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,830
there are

97
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,880
we need some axioms

98
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,020
specifically to govern

99
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,330
the notion of universality

100
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,640
and the first of these is just a little bit tricky to state

101
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,940
it's easy to see what we're after

102
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,440
but it just needs a little bit of careful formulation

103
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,090
what we're after is the idea that

104
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,360
this says

105
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,850
but some descriptions true everything

106
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,520
well is true of everything

107
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,830
then it's going to be true of any particular thing

108
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,590
so if you've got something that says for every x kx

109
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,950
you should be able to substitute any term t four x

110
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,510
and get the correct

111
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,840
piece of reasoning

112
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,040
we need some notation for substitution

113
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,340
i'm going to use the subscript superscript notation no doubt every other lecturer in the

114
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,320
summer school is going to use some of the notation

115
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,800
that's life

116
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,130
you have to cope

117
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,660
u graph that you can catch

118
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,550
so the axiom says

119
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,850
but the universal so claim for all x a

120
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,780
with any term t

121
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,980
substituted for x

122
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,220
OK so

123
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:33,920
all right that eighty four x

124
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,990
substituting for all

125
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,590
occurrences of x

126
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,510
in formula

127
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:48,300
let's do break this point i talk about

128
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,880
support vector machines

129
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:57,390
before talking about that but we can

130
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,710
OK we are making the task of classification we want to find

131
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,060
the plane the speed

132
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,830
according to the label information

133
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:15,890
you can ask ourselves which is the best optimal separating hyperplane

134
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,730
so already fisher discriminant analysis

135
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,770
according to fisher discriminant analysis the best separating hyperplane

136
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:30,230
it is the one that is obtained by maximizing the difference between the mean of

137
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,750
the two classes normalized by

138
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,310
the sum of the the covered the sum of the variances of the two class

139
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:45,100
in fisher discriminant analysis we are solving these optimisation problem and the solution is given

140
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,830
five four one

141
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,270
for support vector machine we have the best of luck

142
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:58,010
that is the one that maximizes the margin between the two classes

143
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,040
this is a pretty quite intuitive

144
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,620
the idea because the

145
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,790
the best hyperplane is the one that maximizes this ability

146
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,870
in the sense that we can maximize the top part of our this without introducing

147
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,590
any make misclassification

148
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,710
i think you know that the

149
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:26,060
o point closest to the hyperplane are usually referred to as the support vectors

150
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:32,670
and the distance from the this point from the support vector to the hyperplane

151
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,860
i put

152
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,460
it's got i've indicated with be

153
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,220
you know if we risk scale that

154
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,390
in order to be these

155
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:51,430
well we can always have scale value in order to be these events equal to

156
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,160
one divided by number of views

157
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,440
if we do that the imagine

158
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,510
given by

159
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,770
two times divided norm of w

160
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:09,230
let's see how we we can compute our similar separating hyperplane

161
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,150
we are given a training set of

162
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,440
input output b

163
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:22,120
and we want to the same time to correctly classifying to correctly classify all training

164
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,730
and the maximising the margin so to correctly

165
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,010
by find a lot training that means imposing

166
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,420
the condition that y

167
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:39,010
the for the next plus b it's great that you wouldn't the one maximize the

168
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,810
this is the expression of the is the expression for the matching

169
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,380
so you imposing to doing this so we get these

170
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:55,580
optimisation problem that is there a quadratic one

171
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,180
quadratic programming optimisation problem

172
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:06,970
four from an optimisation perspective this is pretty easy problem because we have a quadratic

173
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,630
objective function

174
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:13,970
so it means that we can find and we have a set of linear constraints

175
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,030
so it means that we can find

176
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,600
one global of more w

177
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,440
in principle we can compute the solution of this problem using any found to be

178
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,060
solved but it's something that i do not recommend because there are technique that has

179
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,560
been developed for this task

180
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:43,060
usually from the primary problem that is this one

181
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:49,490
exactly compute we typically computer this solution passing to that well

182
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,320
and this is the equivalent to do well formulation of the problem that is also

183
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,810
a QP problem

184
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,830
and this could be

185
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
he did well problem we

186
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,320
i want to find a solution that of the first

187
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,490
each for a belfast on the lagrange multipliers

188
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:16,110
and it's a phrase associated with a coarse terrain with linear constraint of the primary

189
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:23,140
problem and each is associated with training points and i have different from the zero

190
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,140
correspond to support

191
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,000
usually when computing the solution of the support vector machine we get many outside i

192
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,020
went to zero

193
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:39,350
so we have the fast solution and we only have a few support vectors

194
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,300
we should not that since we are dealing with

195
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:51,020
this problem and we are computed in the dot product between training basis on the

196
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,610
training set on the form of the product

197
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:59,650
given the problem there is no

198
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,760
from the solution of the dual problem how far you can get the solution of

199
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,580
the primal in this form

200
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,490
we get what they

201
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,200
and by the

202
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:18,650
and you should note the solution is computed only from one of the nonzero alpha

203
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,490
so only from the training points corresponding to the support vectors

204
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,940
if did finally hyperplane function is given by

205
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,670
the last four more

206
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:39,540
you should not that again like this formulation

207
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,740
of the world

208
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,700
or to the issues in function rely only on the inner product between the test

209
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,500
he made this paper which is quite nice

210
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,870
there's the paper and there is the the software as well

211
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,510
that he can do

212
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,930
both the forward and inverse

213
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,620
in this in the squared operations

214
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,620
and the same thing the same performance can get with the

215
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,740
with the

216
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,690
for the correlation

217
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,710
and this is a very important operations

218
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,750
but the compilation the convolution and correlation there are more or less

219
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,370
related to each other

220
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,520
if i'm not wrong here

221
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,110
the convolution and

222
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,920
correlation they are related by transposition of one of those

223
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,990
i think the late one

224
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,190
so you have all efficient things for

225
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,720
limitations on

226
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,980
in this case here showed four continents

227
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:47,430
here i showed you the sphere but you can you can

228
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,980
we can replace this before

229
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,590
any other group

230
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,250
because you have a representation theory

231
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,860
for all groups

232
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,580
you can construct the representations and

233
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,820
most of them if they have some geometrical meaning they would have a special function

234
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,820
that we have a regression

235
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,650
and then you can exploit it

236
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,470
so here is the

237
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,760
i think the same setup for the

238
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,620
limitations on

239
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,070
for the

240
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,670
we just form on the permutation group

241
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,990
the full performers

242
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,890
exactly the same

243
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,020
it's in a different order here

244
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:32,700
because this is the forward transform you go from the function space

245
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,570
the fourier space

246
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,680
and here is how you go back from the

247
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,930
to the

248
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,920
the function

249
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,480
and those whole holdings always representation

250
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,350
so this is a representation of one element

251
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,540
times before are transform indexed by that

252
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,570
the example right

253
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,990
other than that

254
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,700
these are

255
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,040
there are the

256
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,630
nothing important thing going

257
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,820
these representations here

258
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,650
you should have asked me this this question

259
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,650
as i said here you have many representations

260
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,850
for the same

261
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,290
how the world also some over there

262
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,590
it turns out that

263
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,920
you have written to the set

264
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,990
if you have for example four

265
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,230
s three

266
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,960
you never get much of this size

267
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,970
that is irreducible

268
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,400
you have all these

269
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,530
all of them

270
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,880
four s three you have

271
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,670
only a one-dimensional

272
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,890
two dimensional

273
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:10,330
representation and another one which is

274
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,820
so these all

275
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,530
the redoubtable representations for as

276
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:23,480
for example the that defining representation of a permutation that you probably know

277
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,080
is the metrics three about three right

278
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,460
where you

279
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,300
you have i e j here

280
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,420
and then

281
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,210
four to one here

282
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,920
zero otherwise

283
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,420
i think

284
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,740
is that correct to bear

285
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,750
o is the

286
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:13,510
well yes i want to represent for example this permutation

287
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,850
two this is not good

288
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,260
OK this should be always one

289
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,320
and you have let's say you want to flee

290
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,970
for one year

291
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,910
and one year

292
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,220
so i would flip this with this

293
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,940
I thought I would start by maybe them

294
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,920
most the outstanding example

295
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,510
the direction of linear programming

296
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:59,830
so linear programming is it's an a whole area it's linear algebra within quality that's

297
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:07,110
what it really is about and and the whole area just sprang into existence after

298
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:12,570
world war 2 or in the in the development of world war 2 but I

299
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:19,850
guess the name of most famous name in linear programming is dancing tool

300
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:25,810
created this simplex method is pretty unusual for a method to

301
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:35,600
fundamentally unchanged for such a long time that that that the 1st method suggested to

302
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:43,270
solve linear programs should turn out to have such a long life and still still

303
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:52,500
alive and with competition now from different a different class of methods but they

304
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,050
I hope you will feel that this subject is kind of fun

305
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:05,050
I'm taking linear programming well just creating an example here but as to show what

306
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:12,720
duality is about an hour and then the 2nd lecture this afternoon please sources

307
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:20,500
David part of it is possible that it's about some integer programming problems and like

308
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,890
the marriage problem married usually have an integer number of marriages and in fact this

309
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:33,920
problem is highly moral you have either 0 or 1 um marriages and and how

310
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,550
many are possible

311
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:43,580
and the network flow problem maximal flow problem cell that's the 2nd lecture this will

312
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:52,160
linear algebra as I said let let me see what are the what's the primal

313
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,540
problem the unknown is x

314
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,270
so we

315
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:03,560
minimize the cost

316
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,950
which is

317
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:13,100
C transpose that you see the linear narrative that cause depends linearly X one up

318
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,260
to X and might be the

319
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,340
as amounts

320
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,600
of different materials

321
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,930
that we have to buy

322
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:32,500
these would be the costs over the unit cost of those materials so we buy

323
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:39,840
and materials and these amounts of these costs that's our total cost what the constraints

324
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,060
the constraints of

325
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:47,260
the constraints are 1 here is the key constraint is that the vector X all

326
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,210
the components have to be non-negative

327
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,970
we can't use negative amounts of materials

328
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,440
and the other constraint is that we have to satisfy some requirements and those will

329
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,470
be expressed by a x equals the

330
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,710
so there you go

331
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,750
we that here is our friend will be appearing again

332
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,990
it now notice with em

333
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,370
with fewer equations

334
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,330
so hopefully

335
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:25,850
many solutions we're expecting lots of solutions

336
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,260
if we have

337
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,090
more unknowns than equations

338
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:35,320
but but where course looking for non-negative solutions well then the question is are there

339
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,090
and that's already a question Are there any vectors x that

340
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:46,210
some of the constraints this is called feasible if at an X that satisfy the

341
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:56,590
constraints is called feasible feasible acts and then among the feasible axis we're looking to

342
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,860
minimize the cost

343
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,410
so that use the inputs a B and C

344
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,570
and it's it's pretty straightforward you can see the type a problem that that comes

345
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:15,270
at the cost is linear constraints are linear and there's this inequality constraint OK

346
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:20,840
now that I want to talk about the dual problem

347
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,090
you need is simply

348
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,000
and so should be put to be put in quotes find

349
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:31,610
find breakpoints in that piece wise find function and this is exactly what markovitz and

350
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,770
others have been doing for the last

351
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,520
fifty three years

352
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:43,250
OK so i won't go into details because it's kind of boring just to show

353
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,130
you might look like when you when you

354
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,250
when you run the algorithm

355
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,900
so in the absence you get along the OK

356
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,920
and get the weights over here

357
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,210
so i'm just showing this picture for the you know

358
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,050
can you say yes

359
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:03,210
just showing the for the you know for the you know a OK so when

360
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,130
you start with a large number

361
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,090
so everything is equal to zero you select committee regularize lot

362
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,340
and as soon as we do sometimes that start to at some bibles

363
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,110
these ones and you see that you might have some labels might disappear from the

364
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,940
active set

365
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,320
OK so this is

366
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,300
some work to introduce you might decide at one point that you should add the

367
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:32,020
available and then decided that usually OK so it's quite aware that the variables come

368
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,050
in and out but it does happen

369
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,940
so this is why there is no

370
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,500
currently no complexity bounds for this method

371
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:44,550
because you can design examples for which all viable become in many many times

372
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:49,420
but in practice it took me ten minutes to find such an example but using

373
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,320
random matrices so it's not it's not so common

374
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,520
this is no going back to these guys inhaler president of is this is really

375
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,090
is homotopy method that you see the difference

376
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:07,280
all those first order method which are the best methods like coordinate descent so what

377
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:14,380
if you don't you don't do sparsity directly so you might be great some technicalities

378
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,340
but if you just apply them straight

379
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,110
you get the same cost per iteration which is all of times p of n

380
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,190
p the number of features and the number of variables

381
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:28,170
but if you use exact so exact mean solutions which rely on the inventing the

382
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:34,270
so which we have the precision of your mission precision usually and you see that

383
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,500
there is a strong gain from p square and four vietnam two KPN for the

384
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,420
everyone this is just one of the reasons why the l one on doesn't mean

385
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,590
it uses the fact that

386
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,050
if you stop

387
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:53,210
at only KLT bibles then you get faster solution of course if you need to

388
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,070
select all of the variables you get back to be scale and there no matter

389
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,000
magic because at the end when they called zero

390
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,050
you get by the

391
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,840
ordinary least squares and sigma DP and when k equal

392
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,730
but many case since you hope for specific you hopeful sparsity we will focus more

393
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,300
this is somewhat

394
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,270
so there are a lot of additional methods which i what i want go into

395
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,170
memory proximal methods so optimal method in the sense for the as minister of methods

396
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:28,000
have been applied to this problem and this makes some of the tasman for for

397
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,730
software from the group

398
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:33,380
so the spam software essentially implementing all of these

399
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,880
in the first place and that and it's rather efficient as you would see in

400
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,130
the light of part of the tutorial where we

401
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:44,770
unable to use that for image denoising

402
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:51,230
so i went over the convex optimisation and algorithms somebody quite late OK so now

403
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,040
let's go over the article results

404
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:59,960
so here you have to be considered as well as because life is easier with

405
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,920
the square loss

406
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,920
the main assumption we will make it that the data are generated from a certain

407
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,190
sparse w

408
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,320
w born

409
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,630
and it's supposed to be sparse to have a lot of zeros and came in

410
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,190
we can we do not k

411
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,710
the number of nonzero values for for that setting

412
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:21,540
so we have three main problems that people have been considering first the problem of

413
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,860
regular consistency

414
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,340
you want to but you had so w you had to be to estimate

415
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,300
obtained from the so

416
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,480
of all quick w had converted w ball

417
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,730
his regular consistency you have model selection consistency

418
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,900
we get the correct zeros

419
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,520
when the number of the boys increase

420
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,860
increases and also

421
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,540
something which is more political machine learning you want your estimate of two leads to

422
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,650
good predictions

423
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,110
i don't care if to estimate the goods you don't care if you're close to

424
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,630
the valuable what you want

425
00:28:54,710 --> 00:29:00,690
is prediction so which are as good as the ones obtained by the

426
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,710
so we should too many results the first one the first one is conditioned form

427
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,360
of the consistency and then the high dimensional inference

428
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,920
so we assume that the very sparse and we denote capital g

429
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,730
born j is set of zero then until about them but people also called the

430
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:24,880
support and i mean this is very nice support recovery condition for the last so

431
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,020
which is essentially say that the last labour get the correct science hence the correct

432
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,480
zeros if only that condition which is true

433
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,070
so q here is the covariance matrix

434
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:41,210
c is g complement is the set of an act of parliament bibles the ones

435
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:45,860
you want to have to remove j otherwise you want to keep on the side

436
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,190
of the bridge design of the

437
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,650
tonight including that of the ricci

438
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:56,130
so we that the common sense is for me in that

439
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:02,270
what's important is that that term is large when you have a strong correlation between

440
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:07,500
relevant and irrelevant variables and small otherwise so essentially so

441
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,670
finds the group

442
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:15,670
on the if you have low coalitions because this is a ever come back to

443
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,570
that later

444
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,440
so small small lots

445
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,460
so this has been done by many people

446
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,380
OK simultaneously

447
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,320
and then so first noted the condition depends on w and j

448
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,330
so this is of no practical value if you want to know in advance what

449
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,520
the degree to get the good that you need to know the but in advance

450
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,570
OK this is the values less but this is being sent you can optimize you

451
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:47,340
get max the maximum amount of all possible signs of the value of w

452
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,040
and you get the conditional on only depends on the

453
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,020
sparsity pattern was to use this because you don't need you you don't need you

454
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:58,540
don't know in advance you can also maximize out the there about ten

455
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:03,150
it's all about down to the given size

456
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,050
then fall back down the given size

457
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,360
then you get the condition which is of some practical significance

458
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:15,570
so it's valid in low and high dimensional settings so one goal will go too

459
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:21,000
much about that but look at high dimensions in the slide

460
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,280
and also important it does require on the web and on the magnitude on the

461
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,280
nonzero wj

462
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,860
so to be able to get good support

463
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:35,190
you need a non-zero values to be not too small you need a good

464
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,170
good guy between zero and non-zero value

465
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:42,820
so all these say that essentially the last so usually does not get the goods

466
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,280
it was OK so to me this is

467
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,150
more negative results

468
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,880
positive results

469
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,590
page reads it doesn't make more fireballs and you can see this reference for more

470
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,820
this matrix so this is just the matrix there

471
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,490
has an inverse

472
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,240
you can take the inverse

473
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,070
and you get that fish

474
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,430
so in order to have later policy

475
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,140
what you have to do is that you have to solve

476
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,300
this linear system of equations

477
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,490
you can do that

478
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:22,700
alternatively you want to find the fixed point of the operator here

479
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,360
fixed points are going to be really handy for us

480
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,640
and for that reason

481
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,050
we are going to

482
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,550
look at a very classic fixed point here and so the question is

483
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:40,160
if the fixed point for certain operator access or not

484
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,490
previous on the previous slide i or to prove that i i just said that

485
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:51,350
i just declare that the inverse of this matrix exist but doesn't exist related to

486
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,030
the u

487
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,870
always trust me

488
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,740
we should not

489
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,050
so let's let's look it

490
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,740
let's look at this

491
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,340
so in order to do this

492
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,510
we only need a few definitions

493
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:07,930
so let's take

494
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,620
OK so this is again might be as concept

495
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,240
one of space but this is just an one cleaner vector space that's complete

496
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,490
think about the euclidean space vector space is finite dimensional vector space

497
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,910
the good stuff

498
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:28,070
so the value of doing this more generally is that then you can extend the

499
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,680
theory to the large state

500
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,030
security markets

501
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:38,340
but i just think about the vector space is finite dimensional vectors good friends

502
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:44,620
and OK so we need this concept of an operator being lipschitz

503
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,030
so what's and operators to take two of these spaces to this to this linear

504
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,010
and the mapping between them so this should be something similar to this

505
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,740
doesn't have to be linear could be nonlinear

506
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,660
i have an example for nonlinear mapping system

507
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,050
and so we are going to say that this operator

508
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:12,220
is lipschitz if the following inequality satisfied

509
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,660
but this is of and that this is just the continuity property kind of right

510
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,200
so you apply the operator to

511
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,200
some vectors u and v

512
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,090
for the current samuel vectors

513
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,340
and you compute the distance between them

514
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,570
and this this should not be more than at times the distance

515
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,260
between the origin of actors

516
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:41,320
so this constrains the operator can have on the space

517
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,280
so t

518
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,620
an operator t is called a contraction operator

519
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,820
than the one it was b two so

520
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,970
talks between the same spaces

521
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,950
and is lipschitz constant is smaller than one

522
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,780
and then there is lipschitz constant is called the contraction

523
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,490
coefficient of the tree

524
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,470
and then there is this famous syrian but very easy

525
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,510
to prove theorem of one

526
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,240
let's say that if you have a contraction

527
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,590
the contraction has a unique fixed point

528
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,570
and you can find this fixed point by

529
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,340
for a simple procedure

530
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:25,720
a similar procedure and probably you are familiar with this idea from mister bono fixed

531
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,030
point theorem

532
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,340
so in american and people

533
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,590
also study this

534
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,320
contractions because

535
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,760
sometimes if you have linear equations which are too big to be solved exactly

536
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,840
it is iteration thing so

537
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:48,090
what happens here is that the simple procedure slide is you cubic in the trail

538
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,780
back to in your space

539
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,990
and you apply or operator to you got a new vector and then again you

540
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,640
apply or operator

541
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,320
you've got the new vector and users iterate this indefinitely

542
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:04,200
and the terence say is that these iteration converges to

543
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,680
the fixed point of t

544
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,660
so what's the fixed point so the fixed point of an operator is

545
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,430
in china are you knowledge is this vector

546
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:17,390
that satisfies the the activation that if you apply the operator to the back fact

547
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,930
get the same to

548
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:21,260
so the operator doesn't go anywhere

549
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,510
from that point so this is why it's called the fixed point

550
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,570
and so

551
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:34,490
this process just converges to the fixed point and what's even better is that this

552
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,370
rate of convergence is she chairman

553
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:42,860
so the distance is decreasing at the tumour rate which is really great

554
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,100
so i'm not going to

555
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:52,120
talk more about this you should really believe this is the basic stuff if you

556
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,860
are interested in the two line through

557
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,740
come to me in the brain

558
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,780
you can do that

559
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,050
five so we're going to use this

560
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,490
to consider some of the contractions that will so we see that the operators that

561
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,800
editing this article contractions

562
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,340
and this term will be will be very useful for us

563
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:26,240
so before doing that just in order to make your job offer

564
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,070
reasoning about contracts since easier

565
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,470
they are going to

566
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:37,950
to look into the second of contractions autograph of lipschitz functions so

567
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,950
these are simple

568
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,680
simple statements

569
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,180
so the first statement goes like this if you have operator

570
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,370
acting between b one and b two b

571
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:52,390
and you have another operator acting between b two and b three

572
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:56,550
so you know you remember these vector spaces

573
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,070
you go from the one

574
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,780
be t

575
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,780
and then from b two to b three

576
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,470
is it still operators

577
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,450
and and this is

578
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:13,160
one lipschitz and this is actually actions

579
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:17,640
so if you would need to guess what the composite operator does

580
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,410
that goes from b one to b three

581
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:25,240
i guess you everyone's guess would be that it's one out to lipschitz and it's

582
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,780
and the rest is standard so

583
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,710
having satisfy

584
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,550
so far and wide

585
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,110
so what

586
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,480
now the interesting part is the box diamonds

587
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:45,130
soapbox he's satisfied that will

588
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,590
all of

589
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,860
world leaders

590
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,940
related to w

591
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,630
g is true that

592
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,570
so remember there is this of possible worlds

593
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,020
currently spending it would have been and you see that

594
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,110
you can jump to all the

595
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:08,280
and box just say that it is true for all all the world that

596
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:11,900
it is accessible by car

597
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:21,390
diamond is just the dual box so damage is satisfied the action

598
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,980
the world is related to the current which is true

599
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,400
now formula is universal

600
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,210
universally true in the model

601
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,340
it is true

602
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:36,560
at every point in the world

603
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,830
it's just define

604
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:46,110
but the universe for children

605
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,410
is defined respect to all

606
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,340
and it is satisfiable

607
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,160
the moral restraints some

608
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,940
of his

609
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,490
some examples

610
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,880
that said i

611
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,360
frame which

612
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,020
and it's related so

613
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:16,020
well one is related to world war two to three and so on

614
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,370
so graphically you can just write down

615
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:29,380
this is a

616
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,970
this is the world

617
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,630
all possible

618
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,870
and then the assignment

619
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,820
says that he is

620
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:42,140
three people

621
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:47,180
and q is true in all

622
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,020
our history in not

623
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,220
and so on

624
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,600
now let's calculate some of the satisfied

625
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,540
paul diamond

626
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,650
but speed true in the world

627
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,290
and again you look at the semantics

628
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:24,150
diamond says that this is true there's such as the world in which

629
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,670
box p true

630
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,130
we're here

631
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,470
the one

632
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:35,390
there is only one subset and also we have a choice

633
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,600
this point we have to check

634
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,440
box p is true

635
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:48,030
and again the semantics of box pews tells us that

636
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,810
to prove this to be true we have to consider all possible subsets

637
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,270
and again there is only one which is

638
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,290
the true here

639
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,110
true because p nine

640
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,150
so the second example

641
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:20,270
i want to share with this formula is true

642
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,920
check to prove this we have

643
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:30,260
you have to show that

644
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,290
this is not true

645
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,930
this is true

646
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,580
and this can be true in the first world because

647
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,060
this work one

648
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,890
that means that we have to make sure that

649
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,120
box then p is not true

650
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,370
and again

651
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,050
but we have already proved that box that one

652
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,370
this means that this is also force means that

653
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:11,030
and for the rest of examples you can also

654
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,590
it's very simple registration

655
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,580
it is time

656
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,620
now validity

657
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:28,550
remember in propositional logic probability just that is true all possible side

658
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:34,240
now we have a frame

659
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,320
we have the notion of probability in the brain

660
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,560
now for liberty in the frame and this means that for every value for everyone

661
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:49,420
he feels that four and that five

662
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:54,150
we write an entails gene to say you

663
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:00,070
now we can also define validity in the class of frames so a class of

664
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,990
frames just a set of frames

665
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:07,890
what we're going to have to do is try to decide between them they're not

666
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:13,160
the only possible positions on the question of the metaphysics of the person but there

667
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:17,580
i think the two most prominent positions and definitely the one one the most worth

668
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:23,410
taking seriously properties so first possible position is this

669
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,490
a person

670
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,400
it is the combination

671
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,020
of the body

672
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,600
and something else

673
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,820
a mind

674
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,630
but the crucial thing about this person and we want to talk about is that

675
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,740
the mind is thought of as something separate from

676
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,710
and distinct from

677
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,160
the body

678
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,490
well do you have a common for it's us all

679
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:58,010
so people are people have or people consist of bodies and souls

680
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,100
the all

681
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,790
it's something as i say

682
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,030
distinct from the body to get the idea of the bodies the familiar one it's

683
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,250
it's this lump of flesh and bone and muscle you know that that that is

684
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,970
sitting here in front of you and each one of user drags around with you

685
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:19,190
this sort of thing that we can put on a scale and prod with you

686
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:23,320
know with a stick and the biologist can study

687
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,740
presumably made up of various kinds of molecules atoms and so forth right so that

688
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,430
the body

689
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,520
but on this first view

690
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,490
we also have something that's not body

691
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:42,400
something that's not a material object something is not composed of molecules and atoms it's

692
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,540
it's the soul

693
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:50,560
it's that the house of or the seat of what the basis of consciousness and

694
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,810
thinking perhaps personality

695
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:58,180
but the crucial point for this view is that the proper metaphysical understanding of the

696
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:06,300
is to think of it in non physical terms non material terms

697
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,530
that is i say is the first basic human say something more about that you

698
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:13,910
have a fair bit more about view of the next couple of weeks but first

699
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,660
let me sketch the other

700
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:18,240
basically so the first few

701
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,230
we can call the dualistic view

702
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,880
dualistic course because there's too

703
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,790
basic components

704
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,830
the body

705
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,790
and the soul and although i may occasionally slip i'm going to try to preserve

706
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:33,430
the words soul

707
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,130
when i use the word soul i'm going to

708
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,850
have in mind this dualistic view

709
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:43,840
according to which the soul is something immaterial non-physical

710
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:49,890
some other kind of the body is a material substance this all is an immaterial

711
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,040
it's do with you

712
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:59,190
the alternative view that we're going to consider is not dual list but but motorists

713
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:04,760
it says there one basic kind of thing

714
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,670
and only one basic kind of thing there are bodies

715
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,270
so what's the person

716
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:14,000
a person is just as surgeon

717
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:19,480
kind of material objects a person is just a body

718
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,460
it's a very

719
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:23,770
they insist

720
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,680
material object it's very amazing

721
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:33,980
material objects that with this second view says the person is a body that can

722
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:40,000
that most other material objects can do

723
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,000
on the

724
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,580
mona the which we'll call physical is of

725
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:50,590
because it says that the people just are these physical objects and the physical is

726
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:51,790
to view

727
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:56,140
a person is just a body that can

728
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:57,450
i fill the blank

729
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,450
you you point out the kinds of things that we can do well we can

730
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:06,290
we can think we can think we we can write poetry we can fall in

731
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:10,700
love we can be afraid we can make plans we can discover things about the

732
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,650
well according the physical is to view

733
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,430
a person is just a body that can do all of those things can reflect

734
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:27,130
can be rational can communicate can make plans can fall in love can write poetry

735
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,080
that's the

736
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:32,460
physical suicide we've got two basic positions

737
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,920
there's the dualistic view

738
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,780
people our bodies and souls

739
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:41,000
and then there's the physical view according to which

740
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,330
there are no souls there are no

741
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,700
material objects like that

742
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,360
there are only

743
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:55,640
bodies though when you've got functioning body like ourselves physical says the bodies can do

744
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,560
some pretty amazing things the kinds of things that we all know people can do

745
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,160
which is the same thing

746
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,810
he was one of the y

747
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:11,460
so here's where the x and the y get reversed

748
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,480
OK now if you don't trust this explanation

749
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,140
you can also get

750
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:21,710
get the y intercept

751
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:34,870
at some point zero into the into the equations

752
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,690
i think we plugged y equals zero and we got

753
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,790
and you could do the same thing analogous

754
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:53,140
right so i'm almost done with the with the geometry problem

755
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,430
and let's

756
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,120
let's finish it off

757
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:07,020
well let me hold on one second before i finish

758
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,640
what i'd like to say is just making one more tiny remark

759
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,210
right and this is the hardest part of calculus in my opinion

760
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,540
so the hardest part of calculus

761
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,580
we call it in one variable calculus

762
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,850
we're perfectly happy to deal with

763
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:30,370
four variables at time four five

764
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:31,460
for any number

765
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,770
in this problem i had an x y

766
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:38,080
next zero otherwise that's already for different things

767
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:40,830
various into relationships between

768
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:45,180
so of course the manipulations we do with them algebraic and when we're doing the

769
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:47,080
derivatives we just consider

770
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:51,250
one what's known as one variable calculus but really there are millions of variables floating

771
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,020
around potential

772
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:56,870
so that's what makes things complicated and that's something that you have to get used

773
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,890
there's something else which is more subtle and that i think

774
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:06,500
many people who teach the subjects were used the subject article where because they've already

775
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,450
entered into the language and are not as are so comfortable with that they don't

776
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:11,410
even notice

777
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,410
confusion there's something deliberately sloppy

778
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,690
about the way we deal with these variables

779
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:20,710
the reason is very simple

780
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,790
there are already four very here

781
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,390
i don't want to create

782
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:29,330
six names for variables or eight names for variables

783
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:32,750
and but really in this problem there were about eight

784
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,160
i just slipped from by

785
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,730
so why is that

786
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,390
well notice

787
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:43,620
that the first time that i got a formula for y zero here

788
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,330
it was

789
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:45,580
this point

790
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,480
so the formula for y zero which i plugged in

791
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,680
right here

792
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,230
from these the equation of the curve y zero equals one over x

793
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:58,190
the second time i did it

794
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:01,330
i did not use y equals one over x

795
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,680
i use this equation here

796
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:09,560
so this is not like this one already that's the wrong thing to do

797
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,250
it's an easy mistake to make it if the formulas are over word to you

798
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,830
and you're not paying attention

799
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:17,160
two where they are on the diagram

800
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,080
you see

801
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:25,230
that's why intercept the x intercept calculation there involved where this horizontal line met this

802
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:31,910
diagonal line and y equals zero represented this line here

803
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:37,640
the sloppiness is the y means two different things

804
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:43,270
and we do this constantly because it's way way more complicated not to do how

805
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:47,460
to do it it's much more convenient for us to allow ourselves the flexibility

806
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,540
to change the role that this letter plays in the middle of the

807
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,750
of the computation

808
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:58,810
and similarly later on if i'd done this by this more straightforward method for the

809
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:03,640
the y intercept i would say x equal that would have been this vertical line

810
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,350
which is x equals zero

811
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:09,100
but i didn't change the letter x when i did that

812
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,250
because that would be a waste for us

813
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:16,430
this this is this is one of the main confusions that happens if you can

814
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,500
keep yourself straight

815
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,980
a lot better off and and as i say this is

816
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,910
this is

817
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,810
this is one of the complexities

818
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:28,870
all right

819
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:36,750
so now let's finish off the problem and when we finally get this area here

820
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:39,540
so actually i'll just finish off right here

821
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,230
so the area of the triangle

822
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,960
well it's the base times the height the basis to x the height is two

823
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,460
y zero and half of that so you have two x zero

824
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:00,160
times to y zero which is two zero y zero

825
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:01,950
which is lo and behold

826
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:07,060
so the amusing thing in this case is it actually didn't matter one x one

827
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,850
y zero we get the same answer

828
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,980
every time

829
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,770
it's just an accident of the function

830
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:16,270
one over x

831
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:24,520
happens to be the function with that property

832
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:26,750
all right

833
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,930
we have some more business today

834
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,330
serious business so

835
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,750
so first of all

836
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:41,430
i want to give you a few more notation

837
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,020
these are

838
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,060
just other ways that people

839
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,810
refer to the notation the the people use to refer to derivatives

840
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:02,870
and the first one is the following we already wrote wisely that

841
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,180
and so when we write delta y

842
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,040
that means the same thing as delta

843
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,120
it's typical

844
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:15,210
we wrote

845
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,100
after prime

846
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,640
for the derivative

847
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:25,210
so this is this is so this is newton's notation for derivatives

848
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:31,930
but there are other notations and one of them is DFT

849
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,870
and another one is one idea

850
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:38,460
i mean exactly the same thing and sometimes we let the

851
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,430
function slipped down below so that becomes

852
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,330
the by the act dividing x

853
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:52,020
so these are all notations that are used for the derivative and these were initiated

854
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,710
by y

855
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:04,830
these notations are used interchangeably sometimes practically together they both turn out to be extremely

856
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:06,850
this one

857
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:09,750
o met notice this thing it

858
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:13,080
the underlying base point zero

859
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:17,730
that's one of the nuisances it doesn't give you all the information that there are

860
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,620
lots of

861
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:23,020
situations like that were

862
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:27,390
we're up people leave out some of the important information have to fill it and

863
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,120
from context

864
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,980
so that's another

865
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,330
a couple of notations

866
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:37,930
so now i have one more calculation for you

867
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:44,210
i carried out this calculation of the derivative of the

868
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,600
they think about

869
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:47,660
i have

870
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,740
connecting two points

871
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,010
and just the major

872
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:54,070
if you look at this

873
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:59,130
look at this that given by application

874
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:04,670
the john this that have

875
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,000
by point

876
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:09,400
just the distance

877
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,030
i think about the euclidean space

878
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,360
o point

879
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:19,220
three of the it into

880
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,470
and what can that comes to

881
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:23,530
to connect

882
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,850
so four

883
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:27,130
i mean

884
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:32,920
and on the right

885
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:36,410
maybe but change detection

886
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,080
so these two concepts mean i feel

887
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,450
and also the

888
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:47,060
so a cell does not change direction

889
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:49,310
it's quite going

890
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,910
in the may be

891
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,660
we used

892
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:56,730
after that

893
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:00,010
those concepts quite

894
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,810
so jewish many

895
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,440
this property

896
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,120
OK how about

897
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:11,590
y and also to concept point

898
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:14,820
the theory is that

899
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,190
it should be

900
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,120
i also

901
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,120
should be in

902
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,590
in breast cancer

903
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,620
so we think of as

904
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,980
the main idea of the

905
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:31,690
may be different

906
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:36,520
we can define on connection

907
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,450
in the matrix

908
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,160
however even the completed

909
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,650
it's something

910
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,330
and to

911
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,630
he has something in nineteen ninety

912
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,470
we have

913
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,020
and you to

914
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,240
by the way

915
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,520
and if you get

916
00:58:58,530 --> 00:58:59,750
by future

917
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,560
permission make

918
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,910
this is unique

919
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,580
from the invading criteria

920
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,940
the pulled

921
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:13,070
they won't to group area

922
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,270
we have

923
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:16,740
what's behind

924
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:21,640
that is we define a jewish

925
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,500
some of unique

926
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:27,190
one part of me and

927
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,540
all the time

928
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,540
i don't want to explain to the bad

929
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,850
in a meaningful

930
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,370
we already many

931
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:44,710
given that

932
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:48,520
to make and to high

933
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:51,030
all the time

934
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:54,170
i mean one by one

935
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,870
that nothing about only two

936
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:00,470
and you got

937
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:03,940
it's a satisfying some condition

938
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,530
heart saying he

939
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,290
also to connections to and

940
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:13,710
we to respect to minimum

941
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,390
and that we should

942
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:18,220
we have sourced

943
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,700
by one x call time to the case of many

944
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,880
so the innovation

945
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:27,780
william jones

946
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,080
so what

947
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:33,440
and a

948
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:35,150
then what

949
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:38,790
i action and jordan

950
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:41,120
OK until this very simply

951
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:46,990
the probability distributions p and q

952
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:50,920
we connected by

953
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,640
t and one nine

954
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,820
it looks very nice

955
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,360
and the even

956
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,200
you meet a court

957
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,120
the jill

958
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,650
come to me

959
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:10,170
and i have no idea what

960
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:11,740
also or

961
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:17,360
and and the context in this seventy nine

962
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,170
you also need to be explicit

963
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:24,850
and the cornish explanation yield

964
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:27,450
comes exponential connections

965
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:30,250
and to find connection

966
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:33,000
of the one

967
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:34,030
and of course

968
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,580
well defined we can context source to

969
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,510
by one

970
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:42,580
no i called one

971
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:45,190
this is he explicit connection

972
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,070
but i minus one

973
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,090
it to

974
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,770
makes predictions

975
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:53,310
and that's what i call

976
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,540
to manually

977
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:59,810
and indiana connections

978
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:03,910
hart of all my

979
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:14,860
and so you see in the process

980
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:18,420
but how important the two

981
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,820
test p

982
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,540
it is the

983
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,320
you know

984
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,570
state code

985
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:25,870
how we buy

986
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:30,170
and from that point of view to find connections

987
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:39,820
the plan for the same you have the name produced the fair comet losses

988
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:43,740
mean the case chief

989
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:48,960
i correct because the track and also

990
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:54,590
you know

991
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:58,010
and it's not just be

992
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:03,460
automatic and how have the politicians

993
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,480
although the

994
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:07,000
product called

995
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:10,530
to do

996
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:16,290
it to a

997
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:19,630
it automatically

998
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:25,440
the dual coordinate we have another thing

999
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:26,840
the OK

1000
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,710
the probability distribution function

1001
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,360
then will be true

1002
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:37,420
the distribution and the function

1003
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,480
the killer

1004
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,260
in fact

1005
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,640
and in any case

1006
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,630
well we have

1007
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,370
the divergence

1008
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:49,580
if you think about the hidden markov model at some level is a very simple

1009
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,640
kind of non IID models

1010
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:56,600
you have a sequence where the dependence is just between each object and immediately preceding

1011
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,890
and succeeding ones in the sequence k so how can we represent that in order

1012
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:01,530
to me

1013
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:06,550
well in markov models have three things we have observations

1014
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:07,850
all three types

1015
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:11,260
in times of positions in the sequence

1016
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,320
so here here they are

1017
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:15,370
now we need two predicates

1018
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:17,660
one is the state predicate

1019
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:21,080
this this but it says that at this time i'm in the states

1020
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:24,080
it has an exclamation mark to represent that each time i have to be in

1021
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,280
exactly one state no more no less

1022
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:29,300
and then also have observations

1023
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,910
but so this is the hidden state versions again what i need for this is

1024
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:33,830
the predicate

1025
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:39,990
observation of of exclamation mark time because at each timepoint i have exactly one observation

1026
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,120
being true

1027
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:46,470
take another hidden markov model which just specified by three formulas

1028
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:52,720
very short ones the first formula represents the initial probability that the probability of starting

1029
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:57,850
out in each state that not surprisingly is just a unit clause that's there's state

1030
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,870
of process zero

1031
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:02,820
so we can learn a weight for each value of s

1032
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:07,330
which corresponds which is the logo of the probability of being in that state in

1033
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:08,800
the initial time

1034
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:14,080
OK and then we're going to have a formula that represents the transition matrix of

1035
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,030
the HMM

1036
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,240
the trouble so if you inspect at time t

1037
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:22,330
the in state s prime time we're going to learn is the matrix of weights

1038
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:26,990
for every pair of states that the transition matrix of the HMM not in implication

1039
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:31,130
for the you know solving matrix problem if you want this to be exactly the

1040
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:34,970
parameters of the HMM all you need to do is use the conjunction form for

1041
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:39,600
you here so seven implication is conjunction the weights of these will be exactly the

1042
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,620
log odds

1043
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:55,740
the corresponding interest in the in the transition matrix of course we have the observation

1044
01:05:55,740 --> 01:06:01,010
matrix that says if you observe all time t state s and again both of

1045
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:04,850
these have pluses silent matrix learning which gives me

1046
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:08,490
you know the that the correlation between each observation in each state

1047
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:09,820
OK so

1048
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:14,660
when you write programs in order to me you can you know use hmms to

1049
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:18,030
your hearts content just by writing formulas like this

1050
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:21,780
each HMM is going to be very simple and i can combine them with logistic

1051
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:26,780
regression for example you could have many different attributes predicting state like this is this

1052
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:30,740
is the kind of thing that people do conditional random fields and then you will

1053
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:33,740
look discriminatively to predict the state and so forth

1054
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:37,530
and you know maybe combine this with other things and

1055
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:39,820
he an example of that

1056
01:06:48,640 --> 01:07:06,220
so this is a good point so what happens and you know i've lost of

1057
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:10,530
is that if you just to wait for for markov logic network in this way

1058
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:13,930
it is in service with the training they're not going to not going to necessarily

1059
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,390
satisfy the constraints

1060
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:18,550
what happens is that there's going to be many sets of which there are what's

1061
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:22,350
called likelihood equivalent meaning that they all fit the data equally well

1062
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:26,800
one of them is going to be the weights of the standard generative hmm so

1063
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,100
if you want you can just edit to those

1064
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:32,200
in fact we should be able to actually just one of those in our community

1065
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:37,260
can do that today but you know we intend to add to the system

1066
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:49,120
so what's going to happen is that if you train this discriminatively we're actually going

1067
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:54,410
on a conditional random field is only generative going lead

1068
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:08,350
not so

1069
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:12,530
very good question and there's two answers to so the question was there these

1070
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:14,830
that's of this region is like the to

1071
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:18,100
two making things worse by doing things in this way

1072
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,510
the answer is no

1073
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:23,820
for two reasons one is that if you just want to talk me today

1074
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:27,850
what going to be using is maxwalksat instead of

1075
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:31,320
it's actually an interesting question which i will be faster

1076
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:34,640
we haven't actually try this out but i would anticipate that for some problems which

1077
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:39,120
are will be faster but so far for some problems maxwalksat will be faster

1078
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:43,600
because the charge me you know is a polynomial time algorithm that always does that

1079
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,050
amount of work you might be able to find the optimal solution without the network

1080
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:52,600
of course if issues maxwalksat you don't guarantee that find global optimal although probably most

1081
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,080
of the time you will

1082
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:58,700
what really we want to have we don't have enough to me at this we

1083
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:03,560
want to have an exact inference algorithms such that we can do exact inference under

1084
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:04,160
the hood

1085
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,950
exact inference is what happens

1086
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:09,620
so this is not implemented yet but it will be in know the coming months

1087
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,240
and then what happens is that

1088
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:15,870
and the good if you have a system like for example this is just the

1089
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:17,540
of the existence of

1090
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:20,900
but in the

1091
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:23,330
the book is this action

1092
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,570
in this state

1093
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:35,390
well of course the world to go from to this

1094
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:44,590
you know this is great precondition this condition that have to be satisfied before this

1095
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:47,310
action to be possible

1096
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:48,510
so the

1097
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:52,710
the left hand side is the condition of the approximate formula and the right hand

1098
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:54,020
side is the

1099
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:59,340
collection of different assignments the effects so the assignments conditional

1100
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:04,990
and in this case all this some happen to be unconditional so there's no then

1101
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,310
so that's why it's so this

1102
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:13,930
sorry it's

1103
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:21,300
i had the slide you know this earlier with a set of literals

1104
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:24,860
i thought that with their contacts

1105
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:30,770
for the last one

1106
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,430
so this is the

1107
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:38,520
definition of what the definition actions and this is one example of the

1108
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:49,540
we can make this feels like wal-mart and

1109
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,950
we can define what i b

1110
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:54,270
active effects of action and events

1111
01:10:54,280 --> 01:11:00,050
and what is not something interesting because of the presence of conditional access

1112
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:02,360
conditional access is always

1113
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:06,430
at the beginning is because it was always

1114
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,430
and the conditional access are

1115
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,290
the text the

1116
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:21,910
all the action and its corresponding condition is true

1117
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:24,680
negation exceed

1118
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:26,440
this is conditional there

1119
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:32,040
and the conditions of the form phi is true in the current

1120
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:37,780
and you say that an action is executable in the state

1121
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:41,300
the precondition is true in that state

1122
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:45,260
the set of active nodes

1123
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,220
it consists so

1124
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:51,490
these requirements rules out the possibility that you have to conditional effects

1125
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:55,880
one says that it will be true and the other said there exists it will

1126
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:56,930
be false

1127
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:57,870
and the

1128
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,810
three preconditions the

1129
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,680
let's start will be true

1130
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,810
both in the same

1131
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:11,080
this is not a allowed

1132
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:16,250
and now we can define what is success of events that so the state the

1133
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:18,240
values of state variables

1134
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,130
when we take the action or

1135
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:28,470
and the first look what are the active effects of their actions in that state

1136
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:29,410
and then

1137
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:34,880
this so that the acting assignments

1138
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:39,300
building so the what about the

1139
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:43,250
active effects it was about values that there will be true

1140
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:46,500
so this is

1141
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:48,090
and here's an example

1142
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:51,380
because the state is in the weights

1143
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:55,890
a b and c are true so they'll know trees the variables

1144
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:58,400
you have this action there

1145
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:03,990
precondition a two on condition is not a b

1146
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:09,450
this action is executable because the frequency through a straw this and

1147
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:13,180
the set of active effects not being

1148
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:14,700
it consistent

1149
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:23,090
and these are just a simply obtained by making a false making the true

1150
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:27,560
he must already so the the only change is that it will be

1151
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:34,220
two surfaces

1152
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,270
you on the consistency condition is only for the

1153
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,700
the set of active

1154
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:47,710
i mean this is not a b

1155
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:49,480
is consistent

1156
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:51,260
i'm simply saying that there is no

1157
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,290
negation a and a

1158
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:57,700
similar set that's the closest college

1159
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:01,570
i mean this simply because because the conditions for granting that the change we want

1160
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,330
to make it possible

1161
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:08,440
so that is not not a single thing because those could be

1162
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:09,950
could not both be

1163
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:16,800
many forcing

1164
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:18,640
and then the

1165
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:21,800
formal definition planet problem big events so

1166
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,950
we have a finite state variables

1167
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,210
ball is that there was no case

1168
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,250
there is one initial state

1169
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,930
evaluation of state variables

1170
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:33,540
and we have a set of axioms

1171
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,410
in addition the variables

1172
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:36,760
this a

1173
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:40,790
and then we have this report provides so-called g

1174
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:43,040
expresses the goal

1175
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:45,000
so what

1176
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:49,860
what kind of states goals what conditions must be satisfied for the

1177
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:52,970
i be solved

1178
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:56,090
so this is essentially simply almost the

1179
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:02,380
these states values of the variables and

1180
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,480
the have direction

1181
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:06,270
by using

1182
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:12,490
this is a precondition

1183
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:15,450
this is simply formalizes any

1184
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:17,790
but the

1185
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:23,050
in this definition is to be very pleased if the graph has been made explicit

1186
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:27,360
the point in this whole thing

1187
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:29,550
well using this

1188
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,450
the initial planning problem can

1189
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:34,470
express huge graph by using a very

1190
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:40,320
number of states

1191
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:44,960
and the next one so in the size of the

1192
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:50,130
the latter problem so they could from easily represent the planning problem with ten two

1193
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,500
and the one hundred states

1194
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:54,120
by using

1195
01:15:54,830 --> 01:16:01,370
this the description that size of one four or more

1196
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:08,500
this allows us to represent the very big planet problems very quickly and then

1197
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:12,150
writing then down it's possible in some cases also

1198
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:19,160
we can solve the linear decision because it was

1199
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:22,270
so four year planning problem we can define what is

1200
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:23,410
black so

1201
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:25,310
a sequence of actions

1202
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:31,990
so that the excuse certain resources with which is the state sequence

1203
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:36,690
so the first stage is the initial state and

1204
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:44,840
they except for the initial stages of ten from the previous by taking the corresponding

1205
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,120
action so

1206
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,410
and the last stage

1207
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:54,540
evaluation that satisfies the core

1208
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:59,010
i was simply because the notation here so there is this

1209
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,750
it's all i

1210
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,600
this one

1211
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:04,310
and if the whole thing

1212
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,870
but this is basically

1213
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:09,280
the simplest then these

1214
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,320
this code is available online

1215
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:13,910
you can

1216
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:19,340
come on folks this is basically like this course but online the questions longer than

1217
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:20,890
the lot linear algebra

1218
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:24,300
but actually the details like

1219
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,370
you know well known entities

1220
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:27,780
so what we

1221
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,490
with the common filters for each particle

1222
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:34,260
we propagate the gaussians

1223
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:39,720
corresponding to one of the possible discrete states so the continent state is represented with

1224
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:42,240
the particles are actually gaussians

1225
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:45,820
and of course if you approximating a discrete continuous distribution

1226
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:48,530
with gaussians instead of with simple

1227
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:54,620
particles you're going to benefit that's another way to look at it

1228
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:59,340
i'm going to skip over the details of the algorithm i just want you to

1229
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:01,890
know that that algorithm is out there so

1230
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:05,410
the most important is i wanted to get the message to take home the message

1231
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,470
if you

1232
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:10,220
integrate out

1233
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:16,350
if you break the state space into separate components of the state space

1234
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:19,220
if anything pay attention to the graphical models

1235
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,640
lecture next week

1236
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:23,720
because if you break things into small components

1237
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:27,850
and you can get away with only having to sample a subset

1238
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:31,120
and use this conditioning arguments if i knew this

1239
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,760
we would be using is essentially this map i

1240
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:37,590
if i know what i am i can draw the match or if i know

1241
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:38,740
the man

1242
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:42,510
i know where i am is these condition arguments are very fundamental

1243
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:45,680
because that's what allows you to break away from this course of the mission of

1244
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,340
the these methods

1245
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:53,430
and in fact can be verified this is the simple particle filter applied to small

1246
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:57,780
problems well was doing diagnosis of this industrial plants

1247
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,760
and when you do these tricks

1248
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:02,320
you get an incredibly fast

1249
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:39,340
as if i could be maybe stand up and take up and because i can't

1250
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:44,090
hear you well and i couldn't understand your question

1251
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:58,610
this is applied to real systems by the way

1252
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:11,450
OK so that's the more general question that's like you you come up with the

1253
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:16,490
you're apply it then you realize that the model doesn't do a good job

1254
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:19,280
and more variables

1255
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:24,120
that's the general problem and get the statistics and modelling

1256
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:29,180
if you suspect suspect this is exogenous variables and you will never know if you

1257
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:29,950
have the more

1258
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:32,700
it's it's impossible to know that

1259
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:35,320
because otherwise you would really have the knowledge of

1260
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:37,160
the world

1261
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:43,410
what you should do what you can do it you can do tests for how

1262
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:46,070
well the model was fitting the data

1263
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:49,910
you can try different models and see how well they fit

1264
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:56,350
the essential problem size we come up with models for the world in the model

1265
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:57,890
seem to be doing well

1266
01:20:57,890 --> 01:20:58,970
but we never know

1267
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:02,450
if we have captured troops with small

1268
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:06,390
in as much as the models make reasonable predictions we keep them

1269
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:10,930
it's from others not make good prediction and we try to augment it

1270
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:13,990
the theory of relativity has followed the same path

1271
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:15,720
we choose the theory

1272
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,410
we go with that

1273
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:19,950
it doesn't prevent innovation

1274
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:23,990
some underwrites new questions and we go with

1275
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:27,840
but everything big bang selection just model

1276
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:37,950
they can all be wrong

1277
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:39,140
OK so

1278
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,140
that's filtering

1279
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:46,260
and lighting with

1280
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:49,780
i've been

1281
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:55,450
so that's filtering

1282
01:21:55,490 --> 01:21:59,240
that's the way of estimating p of x given y want to t

1283
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:03,180
but let's assume that we have a final horizon of a thousand steps in the

1284
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,280
and we want to

1285
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,450
do something called smoothing

1286
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:09,970
which we want to estimate the state

1287
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:13,300
not only given all the observations up to this time

1288
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,800
but also including future observations

1289
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:18,160
you've collected your time serious

1290
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:20,950
you can now afford to go forward and backward

1291
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:27,320
so you've recorded the soccer matches three a m in europe you're playing it for

1292
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:31,160
the american audience at ten and they've got a few hours

1293
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,300
so actually

1294
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,780
processed video forward and backward

1295
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:38,280
not you know wrongdoing faltering but you actually want the best estimate of the player

1296
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:43,620
or you might just once

1297
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:45,010
to actually compute

1298
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:50,200
the most likely trajectory with people of the sort of the viterbi trajectory

1299
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:56,120
now all these methods end up smoothing with particles end being and square from

1300
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:58,840
and this huge large ten thousand

1301
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:02,870
so squared is prohibitively expensive

1302
01:23:02,930 --> 01:23:07,370
there is a way around it

1303
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:09,390
so again fell train

1304
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:11,760
state given observations up to time t

1305
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:18,220
we want to stay given future observations as well all observations

1306
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:23,050
and when you do this smoothing recurrence you end up

1307
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:26,660
through a bit of algebra you end up with something that looks like this

1308
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,620
so you have

1309
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,680
the future smooth distribution

1310
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:35,260
you have the transition model which we know that give

1311
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:38,530
if we do a forward pass through with the way we do this with two

1312
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:41,570
and in a tremendous

1313
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:45,120
if everything was described by the way this would be an HMM everything is gone

1314
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,780
so we have a common

1315
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:51,260
and then you run your change a very long time in the long range of

1316
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:52,880
get stabilisation

1317
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:56,680
well because p and is p minus one time p

1318
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:02,660
and if you switch the limit and into gaul

1319
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:07,170
you get that the interval of the limit where n and minus one is the

1320
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:08,700
same thing at it from the

1321
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,350
three get together

1322
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:11,620
gamma i mean

1323
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:15,080
therefore in the is the limiting behavior

1324
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:17,720
it's necessary environment

1325
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:20,030
there is a fixed point

1326
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:21,820
the fixed point of k

1327
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,430
the existence of limiting behavior

1328
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:27,900
depends on the existence of

1329
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:30,480
this environment

1330
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,450
major of distribution

1331
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:35,740
of the chain

1332
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:39,340
and in addition if if is is the limiting behavior

1333
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:40,690
it's necessarily

1334
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:47,710
unique because environmental measures are not necessarily unique if the probability distribution

1335
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:50,490
so you can read that layer

1336
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:51,660
in detail but

1337
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:53,630
this is inside that

1338
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:55,840
measures are fixed point

1339
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:57,050
but they also

1340
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:58,940
necessarily the limit

1341
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:02,710
of of your chain if the limit exists

1342
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:06,480
this most most of the problem is we need

1343
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:09,230
it is the rough

1344
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:13,930
we need is is to know

1345
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:14,900
there is

1346
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:18,850
limiting behavior this is called buddhist

1347
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:19,970
the city

1348
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:24,970
the remaining of authenticity city is forgetting of initial conditions

1349
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:26,050
it is not my

1350
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:27,590
well you start from

1351
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:33,700
o point for distribution in the long range the chain we have the same behavior

1352
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:34,930
you can start from here

1353
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:36,380
well there

1354
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:39,340
after a long enough period you just

1355
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:43,370
i cannot tell from where it started from the greatest

1356
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:47,020
if is going to city

1357
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:51,680
the change will end up looking like a simulation

1358
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:56,090
this issue distribution park and i can see where

1359
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:58,090
i mean it

1360
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:01,870
the chinese is good it

1361
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:04,080
if the chain of

1362
01:26:06,610 --> 01:26:08,200
we look more and more

1363
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:15,470
so the change will be ergodic if

1364
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:17,160
there is convergence

1365
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:21,970
the end

1366
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:24,630
transitions off the camel

1367
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:28,370
towards the stationary distribution pi it cannot converge

1368
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:29,600
anyway about

1369
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:31,690
to the stationary distribution

1370
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:33,320
and if in doubt

1371
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:36,560
this is called an ergodic markov chain

1372
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:38,910
o nine o nine o here year

1373
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:43,010
that the one norm is just the super of all sets

1374
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:44,210
of the difference

1375
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:47,060
between the two measures

1376
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:49,850
the measure and that nature of a

1377
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:52,340
so it's a very weak

1378
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:56,810
but that's that's the definition

1379
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:58,420
OK now

1380
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:01,940
harris recurrence comes back into the picture

1381
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:04,890
which is that if

1382
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:10,130
recurrent markov chain if you

1383
01:27:10,150 --> 01:27:12,390
and invent distribution then

1384
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:16,900
no matter what you you start from the convergence of the and

1385
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:18,920
transition kernel two

1386
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:27,510
machines is about the underlying infrastructure that ranges from the physical locations power and setting

1387
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:31,940
up all the services which motherboards they should have through to the actual software that

1388
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:38,360
runs on those servers so that compute infrastructure can operate effectively is utility

1389
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:41,820
the scientists who creating the models

1390
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:44,730
just a high level

1391
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,230
o machines platform

1392
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:51,750
it employs multiple global data center one of the things is really important in terms

1393
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:58,820
you know managing an interacting with online advertising is not to introduce latency because like

1394
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:02,730
really does travel so fast one of the critical thing is actually to have data

1395
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:07,270
centers all around the world and use advanced traffic management so that wherever the consumer

1396
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:11,530
is that their computer knows to go to the closest data center to get the

1397
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:15,530
information you know these real-time edge servers are

1398
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:20,360
responding to two peak days in excess of two hundred twenty five thousand

1399
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:22,860
transactions per second

1400
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,340
and all that data needs to be collected and processed

1401
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:32,110
peak analytical throughput actually processing data is about two petabytes today

1402
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:35,440
so the job of the machines bugs

1403
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,360
and we have a pretty big thing doing this

1404
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:42,110
is to make sure that people the developing the algorithms don't have to think about

1405
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:45,690
how they're going to handle two hundred twenty five thousand transactions per second how they're

1406
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:51,670
going to how they're going to build an infrastructure that can process two petabytes today

1407
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:54,170
and i mentioned earlier

1408
01:28:54,190 --> 01:28:57,710
people develop these algorithms need to think about

1409
01:28:57,730 --> 01:29:00,650
the underlying infrastructure as utility

1410
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:02,650
we don't need to know

1411
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:05,550
how the telephone system works to make phone calls

1412
01:29:05,570 --> 01:29:08,380
and we do it all the time we pick up the phone and we know

1413
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:11,050
it's ready for us to make a call because we get down to it is

1414
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:16,750
not about this problem so we think about machine infrastructure are you to so

1415
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:20,690
computing utility in terms of the different tones must be present for people to be

1416
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:27,170
successful the pixels related to the availability and latency of real-time architecture always serving everyone

1417
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:31,230
effectively everywhere what happens when the data center goes down in one of the things

1418
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:35,070
that you find out quickly when you have thousands of computers is they fail all

1419
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:35,960
the time

1420
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:40,590
so you have to have robust software systems can recover automatically from those failures without

1421
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:42,510
impacting consumer experience

1422
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:44,820
log relate to

1423
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:48,630
the rate at which were able to retrieve information from norwich service

1424
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:52,690
the centralized processing now many of the things that we do

1425
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:56,820
well just find out complete data in ninety five percent of the data is more

1426
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:00,750
than enough to build models have some of the things we do something very important

1427
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:05,500
to our customers require that you really can close the books so conkers is actually

1428
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:11,510
the first and only syndicated online traffic measurement come service that has media rating council

1429
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:15,000
accreditation in the US one of the things you gotta do it again again get

1430
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:21,110
accreditation make sure you actually counting all the all the impressions made of the website

1431
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:26,920
cluster tone relates to the availability and utilization of our mapreduce cost

1432
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:30,630
we want to make sure that people are waiting a long time to find jobs

1433
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:35,770
that are throughput is continually increasing the jobs are failing when they do fail they

1434
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:37,440
can be automatically restarted

1435
01:30:37,530 --> 01:30:41,900
finally at home the user experience customers how marketers

1436
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,940
and media companies when the using of services touch upon

1437
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:49,070
cluster time

1438
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:50,670
the way of thinking about this

1439
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:55,610
is how you are doing is scaling infrastructure so obviously the need to scale infrastructure

1440
01:30:55,630 --> 01:31:00,580
relates in large part how much data you got family comedy customers your servicing but

1441
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:02,710
another really important variables

1442
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:07,690
in the requirements for cluster bomb is how many scientists you have developed models

1443
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:11,130
the more people we have developing models the more throughput you require new cluster that

1444
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:14,570
satisfy those people it would be terrible if every time every time you add a

1445
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:18,860
new scientist joined the same everything goes slower for everyone people want to have more

1446
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:21,460
people on the same day one the clusters themselves

1447
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:27,110
they big function of all of our of our machines team is to make sure

1448
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:31,400
we can continue scaling the amount of data to process this chart shows the average

1449
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,400
terrabytes process per day

1450
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:39,050
by our system over the last four quarters and you can see significant growth two

1451
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:42,070
on average rate about one point two petabytes per day

1452
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:48,530
the algorithmically this this poses significant challenges that this model does not the reason it

1453
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:52,000
poses challenges is because this model is what's known as the tree it doesn't have

1454
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,660
cycles there's no way following this cycle around but this model has many cycles right

1455
01:31:57,660 --> 01:32:00,760
i can walk around the cycle like that there's a lot of cycles in this

1456
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:05,030
model is not a tree and we'll see for that reason that

1457
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,350
when it comes to

1458
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:12,710
solving computational inference problems this models much harder than that

1459
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:40,760
yes i like you you you catch me it's true i'm only going to talk

1460
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:46,240
about undirected but some of my pictures have directed have have arrows on for what

1461
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:49,420
we're going to do later the arrows are are going to play any role

1462
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:52,710
later when i talk about inference the first thing that you would normally do is

1463
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:54,690
what's called moralize the graphs

1464
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:58,370
more lies is a cool name if you have a directed graph if you have

1465
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,760
two nodes that come in to the same node it is if you have two

1466
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:05,350
i had a baby

1467
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:09,520
and they're not married so if you're in certain parts of the united states that's

1468
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:15,450
so therefore you more lies the graph by adding an edge between these parents

1469
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,030
and then you drop the arrows

1470
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:22,230
so you are correct that directed graphs are very interesting i mean to say that

1471
01:33:22,230 --> 01:33:24,980
they're not but for what we're going to talk about in the rest of it

1472
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:30,600
and to think about undirected so should basically just ignore the arrows here

1473
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:32,370
you're also correct that

1474
01:33:32,670 --> 01:33:36,320
markov chains if you think about time series is a natural sense of moving forward

1475
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:40,880
versus backward but again for many of the sort of core problems that will solve

1476
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:45,840
their differences is not actually essential it is from the modelling interpretation point of view

1477
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,470
but from the computational point of view it actually turns out not to be

1478
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,540
that's good question

1479
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:54,020
on anything else

1480
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:12,660
it depends how you interpret the way the way this graph can be interpreted is

1481
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:18,030
that the color nodes have what you've observed which is

1482
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:23,430
what should think is the hidden stuff is you're trying to infer that the identity

1483
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:25,580
of the speakers trying to infer the

1484
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:31,940
stream you know the unmixed audio streams and also unmixed from the video

1485
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,430
but you don't observe that the audio

1486
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:37,960
you might have noticed this we could just do with audio you might have three

1487
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:42,650
audio streams as an speakers who are evolving independently but you don't observe them you

1488
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:46,950
have observe their mixture and that's what the colored notes would be similarly with audio

1489
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:49,190
plus video

1490
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:50,280
anything else

1491
01:34:53,470 --> 01:35:05,120
any other distribution other than

1492
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:13,120
with certain exceptions and this is probably really what are nodes spoke to you about

1493
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:15,530
how to set things like particle filtering

1494
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,420
so tomorrow we're going to talk about message passing these are algorithms that are

1495
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:23,940
for instance one thing you might like to do for instance if you're doing speech

1496
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:28,870
recognition is you'd like to predict perhaps you might like to predict what the next

1497
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:33,470
utterance would be are actually maybe more modern examples when you're taking on uripattern your

1498
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:38,940
right it's actually again running the markov chain it's trying to predict based on language

1499
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:44,160
temporal dependencies what a character going to strike next based on frequency and other things

1500
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:48,370
so if you want to predict the next character for instance you you'd like to

1501
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:52,830
solve an inference problem you by to compute the marginal over that we're going to

1502
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:54,260
talk about algorithms that are

1503
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,920
tractable for discrete and calcium essentially closed form

1504
01:35:57,970 --> 01:36:01,530
if you have continuous but nongaussian then you have to resort to things like particle

1505
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:07,000
filtering or other kinds of MCMC or sampling based methods those problems are much harder

1506
01:36:07,050 --> 01:36:11,500
so yes we'll talk mainly about discrete gaussians but

1507
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,870
the talk of our no would be connected to the to the more general problems

1508
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:23,230
did you talk about nonparametric belief propagation already talk exclusively about time series

1509
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:24,670
say no

1510
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:29,180
that was an either or the talked about time series i would imagine right

1511
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:32,770
but but much of what he said can be done in more general graphs and

1512
01:36:32,770 --> 01:36:34,850
there has been a fair bit of work on that

1513
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:39,050
the search for nonparametric belief propagation you'll find some interesting hits

1514
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:46,300
OK so social network analysis this is another one quite topical

1515
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:50,840
right so got a bunch of individuals individuals are engaging in some kind of behavior

1516
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,770
and you'd like to

1517
01:36:51,790 --> 01:36:53,570
to model that

1518
01:36:53,690 --> 01:36:58,530
so sort of nice that we've got massive datasets we've got things like facebook we've

1519
01:36:58,530 --> 01:37:02,530
got amazon collecting huge amounts of data on you know what people like and what

1520
01:37:02,530 --> 01:37:06,960
they don't like this very large amounts of data to model

1521
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:11,150
let me just give you a simple demonstration of this is actually illustrate what's known

1522
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:12,900
as the easing model

1523
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,360
it just to be concrete

1524
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:23,700
so this is not pleasing model was was used for

1525
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,650
one thing you could think about using it for is you can think about it

1526
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:31,210
for modeling how epidemic spread

1527
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:42,740
so using models an instance of the of the graphical model it's it's a graphical

1528
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:45,640
model in which

1529
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:47,910
you've got a bunch of variables that are just

1530
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:50,640
let's make the minus one plus one

1531
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:55,400
the binary can think about them is indicator variables for the stay of something

1532
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:58,640
so if we wanted to model diseases

1533
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:04,920
then we could think about x i've been plus one that means that individual i

1534
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:07,990
so that the person at node i is infected

1535
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,770
and we can think of minus one

1536
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:16,590
if i is healthy

1537
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:20,870
right so going get a pattern of plus or minus ones

1538
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:27,620
it's interesting to figure out for instance how infectious diseases

1539
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:32,190
you to expect well with most diseases that spatial proximity if you're close to someone

1540
01:38:32,230 --> 01:38:35,490
is infected in the likelihood that you get infected goes up

1541
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:39,330
for instance every time i try one plane

1542
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:43,590
i worry about this right who's sitting next to someone who happens to have a

1543
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:45,280
horrible cough then

1544
01:38:45,340 --> 01:38:50,430
after ten hours of that the likelihood of you having horrible cough is non negligible

1545
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:54,850
right so for modeling this week sort of think about it

1546
01:38:54,850 --> 01:38:58,540
we've got some graph if you want to model in the plane would have a

1547
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:00,180
plane like this

1548
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:06,220
now i don't travel first class i just cannot draw enough of these nodes you'd

1549
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:12,560
for the higher order statistics algorithm so what is this separability matrix tell us that

1550
01:39:12,590 --> 01:39:14,570
this is stable subspace here

1551
01:39:15,310 --> 01:39:18,490
this is also undistinguishable

1552
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:24,010
that's it all the other things are highly stable

1553
01:39:24,010 --> 01:39:26,740
and from one dimensional subspaces

1554
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:29,780
this is the tgz solution

1555
01:39:29,810 --> 01:39:33,910
so there is some three dimensional subspaces as you can see here

1556
01:39:33,910 --> 01:39:37,780
these are all the three noise signals in uniform two gaussians

1557
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:39,440
as expected

1558
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:45,020
and there's also a two dimensional subspace and it's the sine cosine

1559
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:49,610
there's no way to distinguish which direction you should be choosing

1560
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:53,100
in this two-dimensional things because it's the ring

1561
01:39:53,110 --> 01:40:00,080
every projection is OK but the subspace itself is highly stable

1562
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:03,800
OK so just

1563
01:40:03,810 --> 01:40:06,590
as a reminder

1564
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,360
of this multi dimensional subspace

1565
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:16,940
so the idea

1566
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:19,270
could be now

1567
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:24,530
that i mean so what do we learn from this from this example

1568
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:25,920
what we learn

1569
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:30,520
that it might not be a good idea just to use one algorithm all the

1570
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:32,560
i mean

1571
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:37,170
it's it so in that sense it's somewhat stupid to claim that that the algorithm

1572
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:42,120
that one invented is good in any case i mean it's it's anyway stupid claim

1573
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:46,850
to make but but in the way

1574
01:40:46,910 --> 01:40:52,490
you know there are several algorithms around and we can actually say well

1575
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:56,790
we can combine them so we know what the stability and the quality of the

1576
01:40:56,790 --> 01:41:00,750
solution because we we we made this

1577
01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:02,510
estimate which is

1578
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:06,090
well reflecting the truth

1579
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:09,780
and then we can take the one that is most stable

1580
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:16,310
gets so to say in this sense the the lowest root mean squared error

1581
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:19,220
and then project of this component

1582
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:21,680
take another algorithm

1583
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,770
projects of

1584
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:26,180
with least error

1585
01:41:26,190 --> 01:41:30,360
on the next and so on and so forth so we can actually combined say

1586
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:35,030
data entities that bore you know any method that you want

1587
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:37,290
and so

1588
01:41:37,310 --> 01:41:38,600
so j would be

1589
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:41,740
would be getting out the orthogonal some some

1590
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:46,290
goes random sources

1591
01:41:48,330 --> 01:41:53,050
and TD that would be getting out the audio sources and if you compare the

1592
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:55,550
the separation quality

1593
01:41:55,560 --> 01:42:01,520
if you combine these algorithms then you actually get to three orders of magnitude higher

1594
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,250
separation performance which was

1595
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:08,460
quite difficult to reach without any single

1596
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:11,200
OK so what can we do

1597
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:14,040
we can

1598
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:18,370
so we can we can actually do some kind of a moving window reliability analysis

1599
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:20,090
because it could be that

1600
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:21,660
for some reason

1601
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:29,180
the data is nonstationary so that there's some unforeseen noise source that kicks in and

1602
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:35,110
kicks altogether so in a sense we can we can so to say online test

1603
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:41,190
with our model is correct if the reliability index is is not high in in

1604
01:42:41,210 --> 01:42:42,280
the sense that

1605
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:47,560
that this high error bars then we should discard

1606
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:52,430
this part of the time series because we cannot get a proper solution for them

1607
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:56,450
at least not with this ICA algorithms

1608
01:42:56,450 --> 01:43:03,560
OK so for example these are two speech signals

1609
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:05,520
and you see that

1610
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:09,410
that is in this case there is no additive noise and this is the moving

1611
01:43:09,410 --> 01:43:12,490
average estimate of their uncertainty and you see

1612
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:15,220
in this part we have added some noise

1613
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:19,660
and the ICA model is not x equals a times as but x equals a

1614
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:22,300
times as plus eta eta being some noise

1615
01:43:22,330 --> 01:43:26,950
so clearly if we go with an x equals a times s model

1616
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:32,890
and try to deconvolve then it's it's wrong in this area

1617
01:43:33,570 --> 01:43:38,280
in this sense we that it's very unreliable here so we can actually discard the

1618
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:40,950
estimates here

1619
01:43:40,950 --> 01:43:42,520
and then

1620
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:45,450
and by the way also here

1621
01:43:45,970 --> 01:43:50,420
you see that there's a big uncertainty and if you look at the statistics of

1622
01:43:50,430 --> 01:43:54,610
the singer there it it it actually changes

1623
01:43:54,630 --> 01:43:58,230
so so what you see from this is is you you can see the general

1624
01:43:58,230 --> 01:44:05,700
model is not correct but also in some sense we always estimating someone less stationary

1625
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:09,010
distribution that we're estimating for the sources

1626
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:13,980
this is also not correct

1627
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:15,810
OK just

1628
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:18,780
this is the favourite one

1629
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:21,080
many people

1630
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:26,910
this is a data set that was used by

1631
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:30,520
john fosse cuddles of for example it's the feature ECG

1632
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:36,240
in the fees fetal ECG you've noise sources you have the mother's heartbeat signal and

1633
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:38,600
the kids heartbeat signal

1634
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:44,250
so this is

1635
01:44:44,290 --> 01:44:45,940
the result of the

1636
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:51,330
of the JT algorithm and the respective assessment of the reliability

1637
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:53,040
so we see that

1638
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:57,970
there's two dimensional component down here

1639
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:01,660
and you see that the speed of the heartbeat is is

1640
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:04,520
much higher than the speed of the hobbit here

1641
01:45:04,530 --> 01:45:06,070
so this is the kids

1642
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:07,160
the features

1643
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:09,230
the right

1644
01:45:09,330 --> 01:45:17,730
so we should be afraid of the kids

1645
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:24,810
you can learn whether or not even though the

1646
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:31,620
things that are easy and don't make any sense just you know

1647
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:34,930
again you need

1648
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:39,460
interesting things for you from the sun hold

1649
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:44,230
because you know the better

1650
01:45:44,910 --> 01:45:50,790
but both of respecting domain expertise

1651
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:56,410
on the other side of

1652
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:59,870
the whole world which

1653
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:13,500
he is worse or

1654
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:17,660
an ontology which is very nice and each

1655
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:20,250
the tools will be looking at

1656
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:29,370
the change management

1657
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:34,720
which we're playing around ontology it's easy to all that changes when

1658
01:46:41,450 --> 01:46:43,350
and more

1659
01:46:51,680 --> 01:47:06,230
it starts is not

1660
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:11,850
what we're all

1661
01:47:11,870 --> 01:47:15,040
any more

1662
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:20,060
the support for working with individuals

1663
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:22,060
individuals version

1664
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:26,480
also work that there is

1665
01:47:29,620 --> 01:47:34,500
it's very

1666
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:45,790
he was

1667
01:47:45,790 --> 01:47:48,290
we also

1668
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:51,790
there are also going

1669
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:54,910
doing the thing that people do learn HTML

1670
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:57,910
you can see

1671
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,720
the key

1672
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:07,390
spiritual print if you want to play around

1673
01:48:07,410 --> 01:48:10,850
the old

1674
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:14,040
go away

1675
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:16,910
so that's the power of choice of materials and why

1676
01:48:20,130 --> 01:48:23,580
materials are bundles of property

1677
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:27,570
conceptually there bundles of properties

1678
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:29,100
what is this

1679
01:48:29,150 --> 01:48:33,130
you states and we can all it's a bundle of properties this is the beverage

1680
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:38,170
i could make this sort of porous silicate glass

1681
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:40,870
i could make this sort of power

1682
01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:42,600
i could make this sort of model

1683
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:45,780
i could even make it out of steel versus illumina

1684
01:48:45,790 --> 01:48:48,210
i could make it out of titania and if i want to i can make

1685
01:48:48,210 --> 01:48:49,960
out of gold

1686
01:48:49,970 --> 01:48:53,590
i prefer to make it out of plastic i had my way

1687
01:48:54,590 --> 01:48:59,920
a bundle of properties mechanical strength chemical in this

1688
01:48:59,970 --> 01:49:01,850
he's the fabrication

1689
01:49:01,870 --> 01:49:07,640
that's not a unique solution cost there's is a factor that may be determined

1690
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:11,710
so properties and where do we get properties from here

1691
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,330
composition clearly

1692
01:49:14,330 --> 01:49:18,710
everybody knows that if you change the composition you change the properties but this is

1693
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:21,850
different one tell you now is different

1694
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,010
want to tell you now is why you take three online one

1695
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:28,340
the properties are not only a function of composition

1696
01:49:28,410 --> 01:49:32,090
the function of the instant atomic arrangement

1697
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:35,310
how we arrange the

1698
01:49:35,390 --> 01:49:37,310
same composition

1699
01:49:37,340 --> 01:49:39,000
simple example

1700
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:41,570
one inch-thick pine board

1701
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:43,160
one inch thick

1702
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,670
both made of pine

1703
01:49:47,690 --> 01:49:50,000
both one inch thick

1704
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:54,120
which one has the superior mechanical properties

1705
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:56,390
why why y

1706
01:49:56,390 --> 01:50:04,180
because the plywood has been sliced into thin pieces that are laminated across the grain

1707
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:09,230
so composition alone can give you the answer to the question why is the plywood

1708
01:50:09,230 --> 01:50:11,380
superior to

1709
01:50:11,390 --> 01:50:13,530
the solid pine or

1710
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:18,680
it has to be the atomic arrangement

1711
01:50:18,690 --> 01:50:23,390
the thesis of three online one and this is where the chemistry comes in is

1712
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:29,730
that electronic structure of the elements holds the key to the understanding

1713
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:35,120
not just the chemical bonding with the long range atomic war

1714
01:50:35,150 --> 01:50:37,050
so that's how we get to the surface

1715
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:38,780
so here's the cells

1716
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:42,650
two big blocks first black general principles of chemistry and that's the same with you

1717
01:50:42,650 --> 01:50:45,220
take three o nine one o five eleven one

1718
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:46,520
five eleven two

1719
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,800
this is your insurance policy this is what ensures that if take your mind when

1720
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:54,880
you can go on later in five twelve to be chemical engineering go to medical

1721
01:50:56,770 --> 01:50:58,050
and this is

1722
01:50:58,100 --> 01:51:00,640
the specialty topics

1723
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:02,440
that pertain to

1724
01:51:06,150 --> 01:51:08,250
engineering system

1725
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:12,160
let's turn to the handouts now what i want to do for the next fifteen

1726
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:16,120
twenty minutes is just tell you what the class

1727
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:21,370
operation is like so everybody knows what you understand what you've signed up for

1728
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:24,160
the text is

1729
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:25,620
one shown here

1730
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:29,220
out in second edition

1731
01:51:29,230 --> 01:51:32,550
it's available to cooper's available quantum blocks

1732
01:51:32,610 --> 01:51:35,490
there's even some first editions of their which are

1733
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:39,070
very very similar there are some minor differences in numbering

1734
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:42,420
differences with some of the homework problems i don't care if you buy the book

1735
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:46,260
i don't work for wily i don't shares and why we don't own shares in

1736
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:47,100
the coop

1737
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:49,390
i don't care if you buy the book

1738
01:51:49,390 --> 01:51:54,370
you want the book that's the book i use

1739
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:58,170
lectures lectures monday wednesday friday at eleven

1740
01:51:58,180 --> 01:52:01,520
or monday wednesday friday one the enrollment

1741
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:03,410
the last time i looked is

1742
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:06,300
and even six hundred

1743
01:52:06,310 --> 01:52:12,340
so registrars computer divided between this eleven o'clock lecture one o'clock lecture

1744
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:19,200
if you want to change lectures please go to hillary or lorry and arrange

1745
01:52:19,230 --> 01:52:23,400
because as you can see some people don't ever see if everybody goes to the

1746
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:24,900
assigned place

1747
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:26,890
there are obviously for everybody

1748
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:29,610
so to courtesy i think it's important we

1749
01:52:29,650 --> 01:52:31,420
follow the

1750
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:35,820
sign so if you if you want to go to let x one o'clock

1751
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,220
you're welcome to do so but please

1752
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:41,130
range with my

1753
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:46,770
the one o'clock lecture is the smaller group it's about one hundred fifty

1754
01:52:46,780 --> 01:52:51,400
and it's around the corner the first floor building six one twenty

1755
01:52:51,450 --> 01:52:53,320
eleven o'clock will be in

1756
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:58,170
ten to fifty and one o'clock will be in six one twenty

1757
01:52:58,180 --> 01:53:01,020
so that's one wednesday friday

1758
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:03,270
and that's the standard

1759
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:06,140
lecture format i talk you listen

1760
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:09,850
right things in the border post things up on the screen

1761
01:53:09,910 --> 01:53:15,870
where you get a chance to interact with a greater level is in the recitations

1762
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:19,680
recitations and all archaic new england term

1763
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:22,590
go back to the colonial times

1764
01:53:23,190 --> 01:53:26,510
education would be conducted in an unheated

1765
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,920
by someone who basically hates children

1766
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:32,220
and i would come into the room

1767
01:53:32,290 --> 01:53:35,370
and look at someone and glowered yells at away

1768
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:37,220
stand and recite

1769
01:53:37,230 --> 01:53:39,130
i would recite some

1770
01:53:39,150 --> 01:53:42,870
whatever the articles of confederation i would rise

1771
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,770
on my hind legs

1772
01:53:44,770 --> 01:53:48,520
quaking in my boots and i would begin until i made a mistake whereupon i

1773
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:53,770
would be castigated the rated totally stripped of self-esteem by this monster who would then

1774
01:53:53,770 --> 01:53:58,670
inflict the same plane and somebody else that was education in the old days

1775
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:01,350
we're going to do a little differently this year

1776
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:08,310
so your recitation sections i have asked the instructors not to do that

1777
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:13,540
instead you come to class you control the agenda i have instructed them not to

1778
01:54:13,540 --> 01:54:16,140
give you a fourth and fifth lecture

1779
01:54:16,270 --> 01:54:19,610
come there with your questions you come to my lectures

1780
01:54:19,650 --> 01:54:21,020
take some notes

1781
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:25,170
if you don't record everything i say maybe record what you didn't understand then you

1782
01:54:25,170 --> 01:54:26,670
go to recitation

1783
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:30,140
the first thing they supposed to say is good morning or good afternoon and they

1784
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:35,890
what are your questions and they dropped the agenda so someone says i didn't understand

1785
01:54:35,890 --> 01:54:39,610
what he was talking about at the end of last lecture is the uniform lighting

1786
01:54:39,610 --> 01:54:43,050
get somebody else can you do number three or four

1787
01:54:43,110 --> 01:54:45,010
drop the agenda

1788
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:52,260
so those recitations occur tuesdays and thursdays you have at time when you go to

1789
01:54:52,350 --> 01:54:54,940
the same time on tuesday and thursday

1790
01:54:55,010 --> 01:55:00,100
same thing applies here is with the lectures if you wish to change sections you

1791
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:01,750
may do so only

1792
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,890
with the permission of the the

1793
01:55:03,970 --> 01:55:10,390
subject administrators because it's very important that those sections be kept at a small population

1794
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,350
i want to have the population

1795
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:17,850
number no greater than twenty that we get good access to the a r t

1796
01:55:19,490 --> 01:55:21,880
i don't want to have a section with thirteen

1797
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:25,890
there are many sections they run from nine in the morning for four in the

1798
01:55:25,890 --> 01:55:30,120
afternoon with multiple sections through the middle of the day one which are the most

1799
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:31,720
popular sections

1800
01:55:31,730 --> 01:55:33,370
if you'd like to change

1801
01:55:33,420 --> 01:55:36,700
you can do so only with the permission administrator and you have to have the

1802
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:40,690
reason to do so you can do it because i don't do mornings or because

1803
01:55:40,690 --> 01:55:44,170
of my girlfriends in this other section no

1804
01:55:44,180 --> 01:55:48,440
well i don't give freedom until i got to be here eleven monday wednesday friday

1805
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:52,020
i can go down to the register so you know really like to do it

1806
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:53,450
all the time

1807
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:59,190
but if you have a year after you have some

1808
01:55:59,190 --> 01:56:01,150
and so it makes sense

1809
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:13,130
comparing with

1810
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:18,990
so here i mean matrix is greater or equal to zero

1811
01:56:18,990 --> 01:56:21,590
if the matrix is positive semidefinite

1812
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,890
so all the i values are nonnegative

1813
01:56:24,550 --> 01:56:27,160
so it's a very complicated constraint

1814
01:56:27,170 --> 01:56:29,650
because i can values are called

1815
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:32,960
you can translate into determined

1816
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:34,240
but that's what

1817
01:56:34,250 --> 01:56:36,100
make it look very complicated

1818
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:40,940
and also very intractable because it determines would be polynomial functions of the variables x

1819
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:43,160
if express everything as xt

1820
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:47,970
so it wouldn't be clear that that's actually describes a convex feasible set

1821
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:52,500
so in this notation actually it makes everything look linear

1822
01:56:52,510 --> 01:56:55,960
but it's not the linear standard inequalities matrix inequality

1823
01:56:55,970 --> 01:56:59,390
so it's may be deceptive because it

1824
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:03,490
makes it look linear

1825
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:09,080
there are some similar examples for rectangular non symmetric matrices and actually extensions of

1826
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:12,490
we saw yesterday for linear programming when we had

1827
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:16,320
l one norm minimisation and chebyshev norm minimisation

1828
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:20,790
so suppose a now is a rectangular matrix or possibly rectangular but not symmetric not

1829
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:25,730
necessarily symmetric again as a linear function of some variables x

1830
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:28,150
and the first problem is to be minimized

1831
01:57:28,190 --> 01:57:29,770
matrix norm of this

1832
01:57:31,090 --> 01:57:37,070
matrix norm is the standard normal instead maximizing the value of x

1833
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:42,270
so that would be the equivalent of the chebyshev norm for factors

1834
01:57:42,290 --> 01:57:46,910
so again that's very quite difficult function

1835
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:51,090
it's convex only because it's or you know that all norms of text

1836
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:53,710
but that's on differentiable

1837
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:55,240
and again as p

1838
01:57:55,250 --> 01:57:59,000
as an SDP can solve that gives you practical formulation for solving it

1839
01:57:59,020 --> 01:58:01,540
we can again introduce new faculty

1840
01:58:01,550 --> 01:58:03,480
and then minimize the subject of this

1841
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:05,410
linear matrix inequality

1842
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:08,760
and you can show that this is feasible this holds if and only if t

1843
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:11,160
is greater than the norm of x

1844
01:58:11,190 --> 01:58:13,460
created and all the singular values of x

1845
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:16,510
and again this is linear in all the variables so this is fine this is

1846
01:58:16,510 --> 01:58:18,740
an SDP

1847
01:58:18,750 --> 01:58:23,090
and so this is the will be the equivalent of the chebyshev or infinity norm

1848
01:58:23,090 --> 01:58:24,010
of factors

1849
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:27,810
the equivalent of the one norm will be is not known as the nuclear norm

1850
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:32,500
or the trace norm and is the sum of the singular values

1851
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:35,330
so again that's the norm so we can write it as actually do doing of

1852
01:58:35,330 --> 01:58:38,330
this one so we can write it as a convex problem

1853
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:41,980
and using semidefinite programming can actually solve it

1854
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:47,140
by introducing two matrix variables u and v are symmetric and then minimising the trace

1855
01:58:47,150 --> 01:58:48,900
of you press the trace of e

1856
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:50,990
subject to an matrix inequality

1857
01:58:51,030 --> 01:58:53,560
that's not obvious but that's true

1858
01:58:53,570 --> 01:58:57,710
and so they can that is the p because this trace is a linear function

1859
01:58:57,710 --> 01:58:59,680
of the variables

1860
01:58:59,690 --> 01:59:03,650
and this is a made linear matrix inequality because it's symmetric matrix and all the

1861
01:59:03,650 --> 01:59:07,210
entries are linear or functions and variables

1862
01:59:07,330 --> 01:59:11,410
fact was rxt original variables and all the entries in you all the entries in

1863
01:59:20,750 --> 01:59:23,140
this is so

1864
01:59:34,810 --> 01:59:39,080
the something i should mention here is if this is our standard form of an

1865
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:42,470
SDP is have multiple constraints of this form

1866
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:45,340
you can still interpret it as a special case where you put them in a

1867
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:46,940
broad diagonal matrix

1868
01:59:46,950 --> 01:59:47,990
we all these

1869
01:59:48,010 --> 01:59:50,000
hello my eyes on the diagonal

1870
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:54,250
and then was be and all the eyes will be blocked

1871
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:57,030
so you can have multiple linear matrix inequalities

1872
01:59:57,060 --> 02:00:01,260
you can have linear inequalities because if the diagonals are just linear it's linear

1873
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,910
you get regular linear inequalities

1874
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:11,530
and many of the examples see actually include

1875
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:15,310
so one of the applications that motivated

1876
02:00:15,490 --> 02:00:18,720
interest and semidefinite programming in the early nineties

1877
02:00:18,740 --> 02:00:24,690
i was in combinatorial optimization as and they of

1878
02:00:24,730 --> 02:00:26,790
bounding computing

1879
02:00:26,850 --> 02:00:29,060
bounds on very non tractable

1880
02:00:29,070 --> 02:00:31,900
np hard problems

1881
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:36,290
and now interest to illustrate this with a simple example of a boarding least squares

1882
02:00:37,430 --> 02:00:43,200
so in this problem i am interested in minimizing the euclidean norm of x minus

1883
02:00:44,170 --> 02:00:48,730
subject to constraint on x so that x must have one the negative one has

1884
02:00:49,150 --> 02:00:50,180
its entries

1885
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:54,910
right that's excrete this one just means x plus or minus one

1886
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:59,800
now that's a very difficult constrained because it's combinatorial

1887
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:05,020
x has size and that's due to the impossible values so so it's practice too

1888
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:06,450
many to enumerate

1889
02:01:06,650 --> 02:01:08,510
so is a combinatorial problems

1890
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:15,090
one interpretation of being communications where x is a sequence of bits to transmit

1891
02:01:15,130 --> 02:01:17,110
the received value of

1892
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:20,010
vector is a express noise

1893
02:01:20,090 --> 02:01:23,880
from the noise try to estimate what the vector x was that was transmitted

1894
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:26,930
so if you assume that the noise was garcia and then you get this smacks

1895
02:01:28,580 --> 02:01:32,750
estimation problem for the value of x

1896
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:35,470
so as to minimize the euclidean norm subject to

1897
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:37,640
this constraint

1898
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:42,730
so it's very difficult because of the combinatorial constraints

1899
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:47,160
so in the relaxation we try to find and

1900
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:51,570
we are interested in finding lower bounds on the optimal value of this problem

1901
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:52,520
the easy

1902
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:55,560
so these

1903
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:58,100
using a technique on a semidefinite lifting

1904
02:01:58,110 --> 02:02:02,260
so here i first to simplify notation i just note that the objective function is

1905
02:02:02,260 --> 02:02:05,070
quadratic in the variables x

1906
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:10,190
so we have a constant be transpose being called that are to simplify the notation

1907
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:13,940
this a linear term the suppose a XML called q

1908
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:18,240
and then the quadratic term is it's i suppose a so-called matrix b

1909
02:02:18,410 --> 02:02:23,130
so the objective in our pulling this crash problem has this form it's a standard

1910
02:02:23,150 --> 02:02:26,670
quadratic in x linear constant

1911
02:02:26,710 --> 02:02:29,270
so then

1912
02:02:29,290 --> 02:02:33,840
you make a change of variables so i'll introduce new variables x i j kappa

1913
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:38,340
x i j we all the cross products between the variables and vector x one

1914
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:40,270
x two to get the matrix

1915
02:02:41,190 --> 02:02:43,920
new valuable step to x

1916
02:02:43,930 --> 02:02:47,670
so that simplifies the problem somewhat so first of all in the objective i want

1917
02:02:47,670 --> 02:02:53,540
to minimize this i can replace the products by the new value x i j

1918
02:02:54,340 --> 02:02:59,520
and the constraints they had excised credits one

1919
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:03,550
i can just replace bit XII is one

1920
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:07,220
and of course you have to these constraints to make sure the problems are equivalent

1921
02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:14,440
this constraint is now much simpler because it's linear in the new variables

1922
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:18,640
this is also linear but i wasn't really the problem in the the original problem

1923
02:03:18,650 --> 02:03:21,940
so the magnetic and the objective is linear in the variables

1924
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:23,920
the matrix x in the vector x

1925
02:03:23,930 --> 02:03:28,500
these are linear qualities just says that the diagonal matrix accessed one

1926
02:03:28,530 --> 02:03:32,410
and all the complexity now is in this equality constraints because this is a very

1927
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:36,720
equality constraints not convex and so on

1928
02:03:36,750 --> 02:03:40,970
in fact it means if you write in matrix form matrix x defined is the
