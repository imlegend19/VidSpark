1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
in the first part of this lecture

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,370
ten minutes ago this test

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,090
results showed that the essentially

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,200
we have those

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,780
i dimensional point distribution will approximate

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,510
others is we need to find a way to do it

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,070
there's a lot of an antiquated do it

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,430
i don't like that

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,660
i'm gonna go for basically it tried to

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,490
basically do this using mccallum

11
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,340
because i don't have a clue how many of you are familiar with monte carlo

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,090
methods i'm just going to start

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:42,130
simple introduction to multicolour column that very few essentially the main idea

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,440
b by the monte carlo mean something

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,510
actually we cannot use the

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,540
when we get to the bottom of the column in all cases

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,030
so we this the method which is very

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,730
all admit that was in the fifties known as the importance sampling

19
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,790
i go from some but on their we and

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,740
hopefully by this afternoon we will have discussed offers

21
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,970
sequential monte carlo algorithm that build on

22
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,250
in france in

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,500
nineteen no longer ocean model OK

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,600
for the time being

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,580
i'm going to say that all only

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,170
the posterior distribution of x amount when you know what i want to end

27
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,200
where the time index for the time being is fixed

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,760
so remember that

29
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,440
eventually what i want to do is i won't

30
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,480
basically it to be able with me

31
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,200
these distribution for an increasing including value of i

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,890
but for the time being and we just assume that n is fixed

33
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:59,150
so i would like quality distribution where i noticed the abortion or the joint distribution

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,730
on the question is known exactly

35
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,590
because it is highly unlikely with all i know exactly

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,950
the thing i don't know

37
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,830
the marginal likelihood

38
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,920
in most practical cases of in five unable to compute this

39
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,560
what is monte carlo

40
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,620
o thing actually when you never seen that is a bit strange idea

41
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,010
but it's going to the saying

42
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,020
well if you want to approximate to very high dimensional solutions

43
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,620
what you should do

44
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,410
you should try to obtain

45
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,010
that people and

46
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,960
and being a large numbers one of the

47
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,990
capital and on the volleyball

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,180
x one n

49
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,740
i will discuss this quite

50
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,080
it's basically i going on one two

51
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,090
one thousand it is the

52
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,490
to the index of the sample

53
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,800
you can apply to obtain capital and one themselves or

54
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,330
the posterior distribution of inputs so i assume for the

55
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,710
you know

56
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,360
this will be an entrepreneur distribution

57
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,280
and i'm telling you assume

58
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,750
you our more

59
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,620
i think that people in one sample

60
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,390
from this distribution i'm not telling you are

61
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,950
you just assuming it we know

62
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,820
in this case the monte carlo approximation

63
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,910
is very simple approximation

64
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,870
you say that what going to do

65
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,880
that you can approximate

66
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,780
the posterior distribution having

67
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,550
by the empirical

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,340
of the simulated values

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,870
approximate the guy

70
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,620
by one another so i call one n

71
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,470
then you like mass located

72
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,500
in x one and i that's what you're doing

73
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,190
OK so in remember

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,510
the property of the dark matter

75
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,090
i'm sure you're all familiar with that kind of controversial version kronecker

76
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,780
OK so this is the only thing notable are based on

77
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,890
so it's a bit

78
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,500
when you think of the monte carlo is very confident my believe

79
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,260
what you're doing

80
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,780
is that

81
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,450
even if i give you

82
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,660
the functional form

83
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,550
the distribution of interest

84
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,490
what you're doing

85
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,430
so i tend to go show

86
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,440
what you're doing

87
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,370
is that

88
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,370
your sampling from it

89
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,050
you can on you completely forget

90
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,180
about the functional form of it

91
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,840
the sampling from it on your approximated by this empirical measure bits find so why

92
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,590
do need find so

93
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,560
assuming i give using four

94
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,150
normal density

95
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,400
i mean all find one

96
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,220
get the colour of estimation of distribution what you're doing you're gonna sampled say mind

97
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,270
escape fifteen

98
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,660
the gaussian distribution

99
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,790
only approximate this

100
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,740
by some of them are located

101
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,130
the realization

102
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,610
on the model

103
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,820
this can be find the big

104
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,910
it seems to be a bit we

105
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,950
we start thinking that maybe it's weird but using numerical economic sense because

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,500
well you have this kind of into gaul

107
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,400
this dysfunctional from it integration respect the target distribution interest now you replace all this

108
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,900
complex gordon

109
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,310
by respect with some better than that

110
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,090
integrating with the from them at this point

111
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,670
it might be actually

112
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,070
might make sense

113
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,680
let's have a look in order to kind of more

114
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,750
complex problem is assuming you are like

115
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,740
that i

116
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:07,720
none of the quality function is non gaussian beam strike action is an example taken

117
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,980
from the real life examples in econometrics

118
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,560
so you've got to

119
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,790
five i pointed the function of a bit trying to the big muddy here over

120
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,580
the minor mode in there

121
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,760
you want to approximate

122
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,880
basically do monte carlo methods are going to get on arrival on this and i'm

123
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,580
not kidding you are

124
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,370
basically if you look at i don't know why that applies here just to get

125
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,510
the plot the point think and here and see what he does not the column

126
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,480
already funny actually because

127
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,130
he's going to put

128
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,190
that deploy automatically is going to put basically point

129
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,040
in our ears that matters

130
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,300
we could be more than one got some of these guys here

131
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,580
correspond to the retailer

132
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,340
so we we manage essentially what he does multicolour methods that

133
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,790
automatically you can discretize the space

134
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,990
but you do it in a clever way we can automatically

135
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,750
you put the points

136
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,090
in regions where it doesn't matter

137
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,410
for example

138
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,260
here you will never put anything because you appointed function is zero

139
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,770
so you will never sampled point is on here

140
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,820
when you sample points well most likely to be here because this is where most

141
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,080
of the matter is that you get because you've got that we're going to get

142
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,940
how to you know we can do sort of optimizing the cost function that's not

143
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,210
the big problem you go to

144
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,640
to the people in in combinatorial optimization they give you a cutting plane algorithm and

145
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,060
then you you just get the solution but it's not so clear how you would

146
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,020
actually transfers such as solution to two inuit

147
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,480
new image

148
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,120
so the factorial nature of these cost functions makes it particularly simple tool to talk

149
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,210
about the generalisation problem

150
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,480
we just take the statistics and we use the the nearest neighbour rule with the

151
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,810
new cost function and then we get the labelling about one

152
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:21,520
what you want to be could look is minister government so

153
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,880
why can't you

154
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:30,100
say that you you have to learn the individual cited statistics that basically distributions bunch

155
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:36,690
well even one image but then you should learn some markov random field interactions from

156
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,730
a say

157
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,040
a few images and colleges just run something like the book of common of you

158
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,940
know this is insufficient

159
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,670
many ways of finding MEP solutions to markov random fields conditional on the data so

160
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,080
can continue then

161
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,790
maybe that will come in and support well

162
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,190
what do i know that know i think i think on on our way here

163
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,170
to grenoble we had a discussion in the train and let me let me sort

164
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,770
tell you a little bit about what the problem i think is and that makes

165
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:18,520
it clear when when you use k means all these distribution clustering cost function

166
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:25,600
and you you've trained young you attribute training you have explore exploit the information in

167
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,020
your training image and you have now your centroids

168
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:36,690
basically what this then the scenario actually is you get step-by-step pixel by pixel

169
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,690
the new information from the test image and you have to make a decision

170
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,670
after i give you a particular list local statistics

171
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,770
what what what do you really want to do if i tell you i give

172
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,020
you is in some all the

173
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,370
the pixels of the new image that you have you copied model

174
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,940
and although

175
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,650
no but if you you but but the true the true

176
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:10,270
challenges to define the generalisation problem and you have no generalization problem if i give

177
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,020
you the full image

178
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,080
and if you are only tested if you are judged on the on the on

179
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,960
the empirical error on the test cases

180
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:26,940
then nobody can prevent you from basically doing the best what combinatorial optimization gives you

181
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:34,120
now i'm not saying that there is no such that is when you sure sure

182
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,270
sure you you you you have but you have to think about a little bit

183
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:44,000
like the how you would actually use the smoothness constraint which is in your in

184
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,690
your statistical model built into which let to some

185
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,350
two changes to the game that i had in mind is that you have an

186
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,460
ensemble of images maybe i have a lot of

187
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,810
the things i want to you know landsat images and i keep some back just

188
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,850
like we play

189
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,480
you know in

190
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,900
in classification in the whole the games now not on on individual image but on

191
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,640
a whole bunch of images by some to learn about the rest that all of

192
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,940
that is the

193
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,850
well then you are in the game that you say well you have asymptotically many

194
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:26,760
approach from statistics and was co-inventor earlier in the engineering literature to the amount

195
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:31,480
and that allows us to treat learning with latent variables using the only

196
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,400
he served

197
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:38,210
estimation of these forests are sometimes something to tell you a way of taking this

198
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:45,570
problem essentially doing calculation which for something about these values probably are and then take

199
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,120
the difference is just like me to go to school

200
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,640
so the

201
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,610
here is just a guess the values that you

202
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,420
and use them to create a synthetic fully

203
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,560
problem solved the only problem and then go back and we

204
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:10,820
and it's very specific way you can execute a triple guarantees that

205
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:17,220
and the basic matthias use of simple that are still around the

206
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,920
now everything talking about here is a very simple context

207
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,500
charles and the earth

208
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:35,530
larger models the difference between the naive approach these approaches which was in the first

209
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,390
are sent to you

210
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:46,420
the most basic application of latent variable is

211
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,230
when you have single discrete values variables

212
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,920
four in

213
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,850
and that was traditionally called mixture

214
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,230
so one discretely variable

215
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:05,480
different submodels sometimes called experts to contribute either the conditional density into the

216
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,760
for example the right side user

217
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,910
the density modeling and

218
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,790
so here's the request for example and you can imagine when one goes here one

219
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,670
down here and here and the really

220
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,460
variable which design with these were samples from the conditional

221
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,520
got it

222
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:37,260
mixture called similarly to think that the only way to find fault in general is

223
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:44,730
clustering is that since overlap each other just three manifold a lot it has irregular

224
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,110
shape by this time

225
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,090
now this picture is very easy to draw two dimensions is expected to start thinking

226
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,870
about how many

227
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,650
you need to know i mentioned above

228
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,820
generic looks like

229
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,970
this this is also very

230
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,160
here's a one-dimensional example or

231
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,990
you can see here and then add following to show that they can get

232
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,630
here is the final remarks

233
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,570
with many many mixtures number is not itself

234
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,950
here's what you

235
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,180
here by the way to

236
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,330
on the left is the conditional models so now

237
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,720
you have some input x

238
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,450
some variables and this

239
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,690
so we're going to generate y

240
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,400
so here's the situation is the one-dimensional but this is one-dimensional

241
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,430
well i

242
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,160
it is

243
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,080
four is used to model this spaces linear model here is based on the right

244
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,550
in this year

245
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,960
and the lines

246
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,940
which is the conditional probability of being model

247
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,860
one of zero right

248
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,000
in this

249
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,860
can have

250
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,780
you can have a conditional density for

251
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,400
i actually is and

252
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:16,770
which is you know so very best you're either going to generalise around here and

253
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,520
here think this is function are very

254
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:29,530
the idea is to model this is a very common idea conquer parts to build

255
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:35,550
complex models for multi densities are piecewise linear regressions so now we can extend the

256
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:41,620
universe seems from union model distributions linear models two

257
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,350
mixture distributions and piecewise linear models

258
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,260
and for any more but

259
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,380
rest matching standing literals

260
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:58,050
OK so let's write down a simple piece of

261
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:04,610
the mathematics here and show you what the core calculation will be focus on issues

262
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:10,100
which she inference so this is the marginal density

263
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:10,940
this is the

264
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,370
observations as

265
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,570
and this density is

266
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:19,210
some of the conditional density functions give

267
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:26,630
the well variables and we by prior probabilities is simple

268
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,700
marginalisation and then you can

269
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,370
prior probabilities just constantly or

270
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,920
so you can think of this is a simple mixture density function keys keys keys

271
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,350
or the some density functions and blending together

272
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,340
that is

273
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,130
and what is it

274
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,570
show you an observation x

275
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,760
so if i tell you this model here i put it right there and as

276
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,820
component do you think can

277
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,600
it probably came from the one closest to

278
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,590
there is some chance came from the southern which is

279
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,650
so far

280
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,790
and there is a finite very small chance that

281
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,480
so the point here is that tends to do in the next scene one standard

282
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,260
deviation event on this site

283
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,000
five so some probability for all that time

284
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,750
during the posterior probability

285
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,020
given the

286
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,690
the point

287
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,900
that's the team from any particular clusters and that's just a simple application of these

288
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,820
it can also be smaller

289
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,240
just dumb numbers

290
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,780
there's another way

291
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,270
that you can define you can call this

292
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,900
method number one if if you

293
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,010
three for that

294
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,210
there's another way that you can

295
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,580
find the dot product would give you exactly the same result

296
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,410
if you have a vector

297
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,900
and you have the vector b

298
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,470
and the angle between them

299
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,270
if a down

300
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,770
then you can project be on a

301
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,710
or a and b for that matter it makes no difference

302
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,780
and the projection

303
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,240
the length of this projection

304
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,440
is that of course b

305
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,540
cosine theta

306
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,030
so a dog

307
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:33,320
and that's exactly the same you may want to go

308
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,530
through the proof of that

309
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,900
it is the length of a

310
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,540
times the length of the

311
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,400
and cosine

312
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,350
if a

313
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,150
and that will give you precisely the same result

314
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,160
what is interesting about this formulation which this

315
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,840
lacks that you can immediately see

316
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,110
if the

317
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,460
two at ninety degree angles or two hundred seventy degrees for that matter

318
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,640
then the dot product is zero

319
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,470
but that's a inside you get through this one

320
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,360
which are like

321
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,020
so that

322
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,700
let's take a

323
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,510
down to earth

324
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,590
over dot product

325
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,090
suppose a

326
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,070
three x

327
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,580
two axes

328
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,640
was to y

329
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,660
and i'm asking you what is the dot product

330
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,860
well you could use method number one which

331
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,700
this case is by far the fastest believe me

332
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,760
if x is three

333
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,440
bx is due to the history six

334
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,970
there is no

335
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,230
a y

336
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,490
there is no easy it's there just six

337
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,580
that's the dot product

338
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,360
you could have done it that way

339
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,230
it's a little bit more complicated but i certainly want to show you

340
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,780
that it works

341
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,440
this is the x direction

342
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,700
this is the y direction we don't have to look into easy direction because there

343
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,490
is no easy component

344
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,400
then this would be

345
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,660
factor eight

346
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,390
and this point

347
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,770
it would be at three

348
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,800
this will be too

349
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,520
this would be too

350
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,590
so this would be vector b

351
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,160
and it's immediately clear now this angle

352
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,700
forty five degrees

353
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,240
follows from

354
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,650
two in two

355
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,820
so if we now apply

356
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,070
method number two

357
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,540
a b

358
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,770
first the length of a three

359
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,390
times the length of b

360
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,560
that is too

361
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,190
times the square root of two

362
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,350
this is to do this is to this is to square two times the cosine

363
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,200
of forty five degrees

364
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,340
which is one half

365
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,020
it's clear to any answer six note that

366
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,370
this square root of two in discriminative to

367
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,260
this two and you get six

368
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,020
get the same answer of course

369
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,410
but would be done things

370
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,580
to do it since it can be done

371
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,690
so much

372
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,810
on cross products

373
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,050
i don't want to go through the formalism of cross product

374
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,210
the way we did that with the determinant

375
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,060
i just want to

376
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,180
i remind you that you you have

377
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,920
cross product

378
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,240
two vectors that is minus

379
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,080
the cross

380
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,760
and that the

381
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,890
the magnitude

382
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,250
of c

383
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,580
it is the length of a

384
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,740
times the length of the

385
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,590
times the size of the angle

386
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,350
between them

387
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,540
the vector c

388
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,220
the dot product and cross product is always perpendicular

389
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,470
both a

390
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,800
and perpendicular to be

391
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,450
in other words it's perpendicular to the plane

392
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,570
of the two vectors

393
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,540
now it is perpendicular to the plane in in that case is perpendicular to

394
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:36,090
like what you have two choices either coming at you perpendicular or to coming right

395
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,720
straight into the blackboard

396
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,170
everyone has always own way of doing it

397
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,720
i can't you what's called the right corkscrew

398
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,090
you take the first one that is mentioned in this case a

399
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,700
you rotated

400
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,600
over the shortest angle to be

401
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,010
when you do that

402
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,470
you rotate your corkscrew seen from where you sit in counterclockwise then the courts will

403
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,880
come to you and so

404
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,840
the direction of the vector is such that you will see the tip of the

405
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,890
vector coming straight

406
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,820
out of the blackboard and so that gives you that

407
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:16,610
the direction

408
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:21,850
now i will give you

409
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,990
the position

410
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,340
x often

411
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,340
as a function of

412
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,830
and then we're going to ask ourselves a lot of questions

413
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,950
about velocities

414
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,580
sort of everything you can

415
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,510
i think of everything we covered speeds

416
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,320
i will cover here four seconds of time this is the time axis

417
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,920
in seconds

418
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:54,060
and we will cover four seconds

419
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,570
so let's see one

420
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,350
and that the object

421
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,180
b at position

422
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,010
this is my

423
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,680
x axis this is where the object is actually moving

424
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,870
this is three

425
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:24,680
right so i we were really exciting point in the story

426
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,330
why i want to go rec

427
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,480
this is the sample

428
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,160
data covariance

429
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,220
why how white had transpose is the centred inner product matrix

430
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:42,410
but it also has an interpretation as a covariance matrix i'm not sure what material

431
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,250
single orgasm processes you'll see a little bit in the bit

432
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,540
the gas process for example expressed that

433
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:55,320
it expresses correlation and anti correlation between data points rather than between data features

434
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,370
so it's like a covariance in the opposite direction look at i mean i just

435
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,790
transpose my design matrix

436
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,790
that way

437
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,940
then it just becomes the covariance matrix but it's the covariance across data points run

438
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,320
across data dimensions

439
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:18,850
consider a vector sampled from a zero mean gaussian distribution

440
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,040
z is just as vectors

441
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:26,300
what i want to ask what is the expected squared distance between two elements of

442
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,410
this vector

443
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,740
if i just say

444
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,520
z i minus zj j

445
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,110
and this is an expectation which is across

446
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:41,690
so this infinite times doing this as an infinite sum of these brackets represent expectation

447
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,690
i can just multiply that out

448
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,960
and what i get is the expectation is that i squared plus the expectations adjacent

449
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,880
minus two times that i z j

450
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,270
expectation of

451
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,020
now under zero mean gaussians with the covariance given by k

452
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,410
we can immediately say what those expectations and that is the variance which is the

453
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,570
i th diagonal element

454
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,430
that's another another variant the j th diagonal element and this is the cross variance

455
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,610
the k i j so this is the standard result from gauss city squared i

456
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,640
it is equal to k i first j

457
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,410
minus two k i j

458
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,740
we can take the distance to be the square root of this that the squared

459
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,050
distance but if we want

460
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:29,230
distance we can just take the square root of the suspected distance what does this

461
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,030
mean physically what we saying physical was saying

462
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,960
i've got two correlated points from gauss distribution

463
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,330
there are indexed by the data point number as it were

464
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,980
so on sampling these two separate correlated points and that's doing it a million times

465
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,300
on average what is the distance between those points is the question

466
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,780
now if strongly correlated if the correlation is so strong that the cross correlation is

467
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,390
basically the same as the variance of the cross correlation is one and each of

468
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:04,270
these variances one the distance between them is one plus one minus two

469
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,020
so that if it is the same data point five is equal to j this

470
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:12,050
is k i i plus kjj minus two k two k i i k i

471
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,550
minus two k i if i is equal to j and then the distance is

472
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:20,210
zero or if the point is strongly correlated expected distance are very small

473
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,800
if the points are uncorrelated

474
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,050
let's say that the variance of the i th point was one

475
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,360
the variance of the j th point was also one and there was no correlation

476
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,530
between so cross covariance is zero

477
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,830
then the squared distance will be

478
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,990
and it is in between them on average to be square root of two

479
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,170
so that's basically saying so what i'm saying is that if

480
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,030
you have a gas in distribution

481
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:49,780
o two thousand distributions with unit variance and you sample two different points

482
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,490
to those on average the distance between them will be

483
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,460
square root of two

484
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,620
now there will be a lot of variance between the average distance between them is

485
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:04,240
so this is the transformation i'm going to suggest between

486
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,960
the similarity matrix

487
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:11,610
and the distance matrix if we interpret the similarity matrix is a covariance

488
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,640
we substitute in this form of what we see is

489
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,110
which is the euclidean distance

490
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,360
so on the covariance matrix the expected distance

491
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,450
between those two points is equal to the euclidean distance now

492
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,510
be careful because

493
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,180
when the wise are being sampled there

494
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:37,330
generating the covariance matrix and not the sample from the covariance matrix the covariance matrix

495
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,420
of function of y another sample from it is a function of one so is

496
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,400
then relationship between if we set k equal to that

497
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,770
this functional form and then we sample data points from it on average

498
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,460
those points will be the same distance apart as the euclidean distance between those two

499
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:01,710
now for other distance matrices over the euclidean distance we knew we were starting from

500
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,480
euclidean distance in the first place if we wrote down the euclidean distances this wouldn't

501
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,840
be a problem

502
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,900
we would be off scot-free in the first place

503
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,780
but that's not what's going on

504
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:16,270
we have this distance matrix in some cases and this is going to give us

505
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,850
an approach to reforming classical multidimensional scaling

506
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,350
a classical example redraw a map from the road distances between the city

507
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,440
in order to figure out the weather

508
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,580
the office bearers are just a cheap way of doing the computation

509
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:34,480
the important thing to understand from the math point of view i is just we

510
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,230
have lots of possible ways of explaining

511
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,900
the ice cream

512
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,520
and we're interested in which of those explanations involved data

513
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,380
did well

514
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,290
cold and a thirteen called

515
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:53,500
so how many of the what the total probability of explanations that go across that

516
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,420
OK so

517
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,880
let's look now at

518
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,560
the picture that we actually got of the second order probabilities it's kind of any

519
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,940
picture actually

520
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,730
if i can manage to get

521
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,710
the spreadsheet go over to good

522
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,480
OK so there are four kinds of by

523
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,650
four kinds of days

524
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:20,060
there's days where

525
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,210
thursday's which are hard to hide

526
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,360
and we're pretty sure we have those during hot spells

527
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,710
and pretty sure that we don't have them during the cold spell

528
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,020
and there are days which are the yellow ones which are called the cold

529
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,290
so either the

530
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,420
so i the

531
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,770
the problem

532
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:42,290
dark purple one start from stars which are called called pretty sure we have those

533
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,960
only during the cold spells but look at these other ones hot to cold cold

534
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:52,310
so over here when the cold spell starts we're pretty sure that day fourteen

535
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,080
what they called the heart with hot to cold a

536
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:00,250
and we're pretty sure that either day twenty seven order twenty eight

537
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:05,960
it was a cold-hearted but we're not sure which each one individually has probability less

538
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,380
than less than point five what's really going on here is that we think we

539
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,730
either had this the two ice-cream day

540
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,250
we think we either have cold cold hot or cold hot hot and we don't

541
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,690
know which

542
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,520
so if we're looking at a third order probabilities

543
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,770
which you could do

544
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:28,960
then we see that cold cold hot and cold heart were both likely to rule

545
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,310
is showing second order

546
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,420
but that doesn't show the correlation between these two but basically if one if this

547
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,940
is a cold hot then this one probably is

548
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,480
i and vice versa

549
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:51,190
i guess they couldn't both be coulthard

550
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:57,360
OK so let's see no um

551
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,790
let's go back to our flat picture again

552
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:14,270
so here we have inertia show

553
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,880
and no information

554
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,360
what do you think will happen if we change the probability of starting on hot

555
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,810
data point seven

556
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,360
so this point five point five will turn to point three point seven

557
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,830
what do you think will happen to this graph

558
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:37,980
we started on what we started to i spend a

559
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,000
so i decided

560
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,310
yeah OK

561
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,200
so you think we're going to be point seven likely to make the first i

562
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,000
from the right

563
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:51,020
since we get no information from here anymore

564
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,520
and then what will happen after that one i guess

565
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,310
so i

566
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:03,630
OK so you think it also because of inertia also a point seven

567
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,580
so we think that the rest of the summer is likely to be high

568
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,080
OK so let's see what happens

569
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,330
it's always nice to be able to do experiments

570
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,000
OK you're right about the first thing but not the second

571
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,770
the reason is that the universe is perfect you write it would start point seven

572
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:21,590
everhart a one hundred percent likely to be followed by heart

573
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,460
but it's not so what happens here is but that's not actually the second autograph

574
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:36,830
because i think that'll shed some light

575
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,500
so here

576
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,520
we're saying this day is

577
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,860
remember that this was likely to be a hot day but it's also

578
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:50,110
more likely to be hot to cold than cold

579
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,770
how can be called the hard probably not called

580
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,960
so if you're more likely to be high

581
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,130
remember that you whatever you are you have a you have a ten percent chance

582
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,850
of switching to the other whether

583
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,860
whatever whether you are

584
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,000
the switches are more likely to be if are more likely to be hard the

585
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,980
switches are more likely to be in the cold direction

586
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,460
and that's why the weather tends to get colder

587
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,960
over time so this is the current whether the long-term behaviour

588
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,250
of this kind of system with some kind of inertia or anti inertia the long-term

589
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,710
behavior is called the climate

590
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:33,080
and any set of transition probabilities will eventually also lisa will eventually stabilize like this

591
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,420
to some overall weather so we see here that

592
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,130
in the long term

593
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,540
we were about fifty percent likely to be

594
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,860
to be high even though we happen to have a particular you know we're seventy

595
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,610
percent likely on the first day

596
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:52,130
in the long run were only fifty percent because that's what the long-term climate is

597
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:57,520
the reason that we don't get this behavior when we actually see the ice creams

598
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,830
is we've got some data about that correlated with the actual weather so we can

599
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:06,170
reconstruct but what this is showing is what would happen if we started a system

600
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,110
like this and we generated it using a right when the latter died so what

601
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:14,150
the press which does now generating hot cold cold

602
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,040
according to the point one point and if you try doing it by flipping coins

603
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,250
you'll discover that eventually you will

604
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:30,130
get about half higher and have called

605
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,630
OK so now

606
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:35,520
i have an interesting question for you

607
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,670
so we've done this picture here

608
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:45,440
the old friends

609
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,170
so is

610
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:59,650
in fact

611
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,480
from about

612
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,230
the channel

613
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,190
the first term

614
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,800
like the last

615
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,340
o point

616
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:53,690
o point o

617
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:16,380
but just

618
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:24,380
what can i do that

619
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,570
the structure

620
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:55,670
so far

621
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,170
in fact

622
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:28,980
so far

623
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:34,070
for before

624
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:52,260
one of them

625
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,010
one of the

626
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:14,670
one of the best of the rest

627
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,730
so what

628
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:46,880
one of

629
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,840
are all

630
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:01,340
the fact that terms

631
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,510
i want to solve

632
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,630
one of the

633
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,380
one of the material

634
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,360
so just

635
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:53,550
one of the start

636
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,960
algorithm just given you one way to design an algorithm which turns out to be

637
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,850
useful but it's certainly not the only way

638
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:06,260
here are some papers where some of these topics are discussed and some other extensions

639
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,340
and i mentioned if you want to look at

640
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:12,480
francis slides from last year that's only a source for a lot more information about

641
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,780
this includes in particular really long bibliography

642
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:22,460
OK for topic this is one that i just touched on five to ten minutes

643
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:27,350
ago and that's trying to identify the optimal manifold which is solution lies

644
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:30,560
this is an issue if you're trying to do the regularized problem and i just

645
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,280
talked about it's also an issue when you trying to minimize over constraints applicable in

646
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,530
and issues as far as follows often the study of the lies in the low

647
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:47,810
dimensional subsets of the set that you're interested in the space you're interested in

648
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,460
so in particular the regularizer one norm what you really would like to know is

649
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,280
which components of x zero and which are not zero

650
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,240
and so you can you can sort of define if you know

651
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:03,990
if you were to know what the solution x tau was you can define a

652
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,620
consisting of basically the the

653
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,260
the vectors z

654
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:14,430
that have no zeros in the same place as the nonzeros next style

655
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,280
and has zero whenever the next hours

656
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:23,510
that defines the reduced manifold that can be parameterized with a as a number of

657
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,230
parameters is significantly less than n

658
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,300
a few nonzeros

659
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:34,070
in the case of the save box constraint if you try to minimize f over

660
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,630
some polyhedron

661
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:40,050
if you're interested to know what faces of the polyhedron does x style so in

662
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:45,350
the case of three dimensions here suppose x dawood alliance edge the appropriate manifold that

663
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,540
would be interested to know would be

664
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:49,690
this said we'd like to know that

665
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:53,050
you know if we knew the next allied to lie on the stage

666
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,810
we could just focused on minimizing f along the said we could just ditch two

667
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:02,240
of the three unknowns and just solve a problem in one dimension

668
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,070
so if we were to know

669
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:11,600
this manifold in which the solution lies we can often vastly simplify the optimisation problem

670
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:15,030
but why is that useful because we don't know text are is right so if

671
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:20,260
you know next why do we think we can identify the manifold on which lies

672
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:23,070
well it turns out that you can sometimes OK

673
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:24,960
even without knowing next

674
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,200
if close enough to extend often you can get a pretty good read on what

675
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,110
the optimal manifold

676
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:33,260
so let me try to describe how that is this is a little bit thorny

677
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,050
this like throwing in some

678
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,440
very elementary convex analysis here

679
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,750
but is the idea so let's let's take the setting that i had on the

680
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,850
previous slide where we're minimizing over constraints

681
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:50,490
and i'm assuming that x is that makers closed convex sets

682
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,140
the optimality condition for x

683
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,430
start to be a stationary point

684
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:58,300
for this constrained optimisation problem here

685
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,350
is that the negative gradient

686
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,090
of f at x to

687
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:06,530
it lies in the normal current two my your next what's in normal kind

688
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,090
normal cone is the set of all vectors make an angle of more than pi

689
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,220
over two

690
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,670
with all the feasible vectors emanating from next OK so if you take all the

691
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:18,020
possible directions you can move into america

692
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,420
from ext r

693
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,280
and then look look at the vectors that make an angle of more than five

694
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,720
two with all those directions you get the normal set his the picture

695
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,550
so to the extent that i had on the previous slide the normal says basically

696
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,110
this plane

697
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,380
o this quarter of the plane

698
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:39,790
that is anchored here next and you can see that any vector my drawing is

699
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:43,470
not very good but any vector in this shaded area

700
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,520
it makes angle of leaves pi over two

701
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,880
with all the feasible directions coming out of x to all the directions move into

702
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,000
the box

703
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,490
gonna make an angle of least prior two

704
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,460
with these vectors here

705
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:01,800
so basically you want to know that negative gradient lies somewhere in the shaded region

706
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,430
OK that's what this condition is

707
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,340
and i'm just shifting both

708
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,460
left and right hand side by next

709
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,540
OK now what i'm going to do with this set

710
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:16,130
this set x topless in a major effects that this is just a piece of

711
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,080
the plane as i mentioned

712
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:22,770
but if i take x starring and moved up and down the the optimal manifold

713
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,400
and dragged the normal current

714
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,490
up and down as well

715
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,690
i get said that actually has full has an interior r three

716
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:38,230
OK then it has a non-zero measuring the full space in so you can imagine

717
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:39,780
i take the set

718
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,930
and just move up and down the optimal manifold i get an entire when she

719
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:48,300
because it has nonempty interior in r three

720
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,180
so another given that some notation of called set are the major and

721
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:59,770
now here's the thing provided x is close enough to the text

722
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,080
and it turns out that x minus

723
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,820
great effort x

724
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:09,620
it lies inside the set provided you got appropriate nondegeneracy condition

725
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,720
OK the x minus graphics lies inside the set is the set of i got

726
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:18,000
by taking the normal current moving up and down the manifold

727
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,400
and so therefore if that's true then if i take this

728
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:27,200
vector and projected back onto the optimal onto the constraints my guess actually land on

729
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,700
the optimal manifold

730
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,170
so what this is saying is that if i got an appropriate nondegeneracy conditions

731
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:38,940
you know things are relatively nice then i can identify the optimal manifold from any

732
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,050
point x that's close enough to next i don't have to know text are is

733
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,310
i just have to be

734
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:49,260
you have to be using an algorithm has converting text down eventually by doing something

735
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,340
like this whole identify the right manifold

736
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,000
OK so that's the idea now this nondegeneracy condition i'm kind skating of that but

737
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,890
actually did come up in

738
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:04,930
and bill months tutorial this morning you know i can't describe the all the statistical

739
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,270
details for you but he had a condition in this somewhere that said that the

740
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,220
would get the set of nonzeros in by to correct

741
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:18,730
he's using baited using x provided that the minimum of the the true non-zero axis

742
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,480
was above some threshold

743
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,400
in other words he need clean distinction between the elements abated that really were nonzero

744
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,850
and the ones who is zero

745
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,950
so that's something like this relative interior condition and i'm talking about here

746
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,210
so you do need condition like

747
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,280
OK so what can we use this algorithm so if we got away of

748
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:45,360
eventually getting a good estimate of the correct manifold then we've got away of just

749
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:50,650
being able to do and do an exploration of much reduced space we can just

750
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,270
explore the space and

751
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:57,110
by using some other kinds of methods like reduce newton's method or quasi newton methods

752
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,430
or whatever

753
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,430
and it can often be much cheaper than trying to do things in the full

754
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:05,640
space because for example if i'm just playing it if i'm just decided to stick

755
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,090
to and i might only know a piece of the gradient my mother need to

756
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:14,800
know piece of the gradient might not have to evaluate the whole grain anymore just

757
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,940
to peace

758
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,940
and the relation is exactly what we had there

759
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,630
it is w

760
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:27,850
that's the

761
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,230
that's the

762
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:37,120
that's the that's the step we have to take those matrix w that gives a

763
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,650
change of basis

764
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:44,690
i what i want to do is

765
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:49,830
think about matrix transformations and matrices

766
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:55,690
so here's here's the question that could to complete this lecture

767
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:57,650
suppose i have

768
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:02,850
a linear transformation t

769
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:06,720
so it's it's it's it's we would think of it as an eight as an

770
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,330
n by n matrix

771
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:12,020
and it's computed with respect to

772
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,330
a certain basis

773
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,370
so t

774
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:16,890
so not a sudden

775
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,630
i got the transformation t periods

776
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:24,130
that's taking eight dimensional space for eight dimensional space

777
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,150
let's get matrices in there

778
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,730
so with respect to

779
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,620
with respect to

780
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:39,170
of the first places say we want to be a

781
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,540
it has

782
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:44,810
a matrix

783
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:51,270
i'm just setting up letters here

784
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,310
with respect to

785
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:59,940
the second basis a are making you one up two

786
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,460
or w one and w w

787
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,690
w one up two

788
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:06,000
w eight

789
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,520
it has

790
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,790
a matrix b

791
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,870
and my question is

792
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,730
what's the connection between a and b

793
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:23,170
as the matrix transformation t is settled

794
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,810
we could say

795
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:27,500
it's a rotation

796
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,560
for example

797
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:34,130
so that would be one transformation of a dimensional space just spinel

798
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:36,540
or projected

799
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:40,850
or whatever

800
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:43,940
whatever linear transformation we've got

801
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,850
now we have to remember

802
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:50,670
so i so for my first step is to remind you how you create that

803
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:55,460
then my second step is

804
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,370
we will use the same method to really be

805
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:03,400
but because it came from the same transformation there's gotta be a relation between a

806
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,210
and b

807
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,580
what's the what's the relation between a and b

808
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:11,150
and let me jump to the

809
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:14,170
answer on that one

810
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:18,650
that if i have if i have the same transformation

811
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:19,460
and i'm

812
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:24,600
computer it's matrix in one basis and then computed in another basis

813
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:28,790
those two matrices are similar

814
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:34,940
so these two matrices are similar now do you remember what similar matrices meant

815
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,810
similar a is similar to the two matrices are similar

816
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,480
and what i mean by that

817
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,850
i mean that i take the matrix b

818
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,560
and i can compute it

819
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,190
from the matrix a

820
00:51:55,210 --> 00:52:00,060
using a or using some similarities of matrix and

821
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:04,100
on one side and an inverse on the other

822
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:09,670
and this and will be the change of basis vectors

823
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:15,330
i'm having to this this part of the lecture is admittedly compressed

824
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,330
what i wanted to know what it's really about

825
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,540
the conclusion that i want you to

826
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:29,230
now i have to go back and say what does it mean

827
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:33,270
four eight to be the matrix of this transformation t

828
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,540
and so i have to remind you what that meant that was in the last

829
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:45,630
then this is the conclusion that if i change to a different basis

830
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:46,810
we now know

831
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:51,200
i think linearly polarized radiation

832
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,380
this is my easy direction going to make it a traveling wave

833
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,730
this is my x direction

834
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:00,600
and this is my wide election

835
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,690
good linearly polarized with the asian

836
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:09,020
only has x component

837
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:13,660
i'm going to make it move in this direction

838
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,720
so at this very moment in time

839
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:20,220
if it is traveling wave would i don't need any more but i just want

840
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,220
to remind you

841
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,460
so to be factor

842
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:23,970
i would be in this direction

843
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,150
so to e crosby

844
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,380
is in the direction of propagation

845
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:33,450
so i have an incident wave

846
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:35,020
so i write down

847
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,850
your phi

848
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,420
so the church

849
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,930
and then it is travelling wave so i get the cosine and sine if you

850
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,600
prefer that

851
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,460
mine is only getting

852
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:54,040
so propagating in this direction

853
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,610
this is the key factor

854
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,960
and that the incident wave

855
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:04,050
x the action so their plane waves

856
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,480
perpendicular to see infinite in all directions

857
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,550
the vector is everywhere in those planes

858
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,310
this value changes was

859
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,930
c and the changes with time

860
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:17,700
now i'm going to do

861
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,400
i'm going to put here

862
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,900
perfect conductor

863
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:25,470
and so he vectorized there

864
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:29,790
there is no normal component to the vector so i don't worry about your friend

865
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,400
there's no normal component only have t

866
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:34,900
that you've t must be

867
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:35,920
comes zero

868
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:38,160
at the conductor

869
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,420
so this reminds you

870
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,450
the string that we had

871
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,190
when we were recording the string at one side

872
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,960
and we fix that side of the story

873
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,470
then in order to make sure that there was no motion of the end of

874
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,140
the spring

875
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:59,340
the reflectivity was minus one came back the valley to make sure that this point

876
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,480
never will

877
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:04,200
so exactly the same thing is happening now

878
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:08,440
we must make sure that right the electric vector is always at all moments in

879
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,210
time zero

880
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:11,930
so if i just call this

881
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:15,460
for convenience single zero this location

882
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,700
then the

883
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,000
reflective wave

884
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:22,090
must be minus is zero

885
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:24,570
it is the mountain becomes valley

886
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:25,810
and then it

887
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,380
moves in the opposite direction so you get kc

888
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,270
plus omega t

889
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,400
in the x direction

890
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:37,800
you will see that the sum of these two at any moment in time

891
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:43,050
will make the vector right here in this entire plane which is infinitely large

892
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:49,490
that's the boundary condition that we have to me

893
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:52,750
the total electric field

894
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,760
which is the sum of the two one moving in this direction

895
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,570
and this one moving backwards

896
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,380
it is of course the factorial some

897
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:04,650
so i have the cosine of of

898
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,020
call that of

899
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:09,290
mine is the cosine of data

900
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:11,910
i schooldays tell you that that is

901
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,420
twice the sine of half the sum

902
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,600
sign of half the difference

903
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:19,570
although i always have to look that up because i forget that just as well

904
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:21,110
as you do

905
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:23,340
so when i had that then

906
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:25,950
then i get that the total electric field

907
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,850
which is the sum of the two

908
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,000
it's going to be

909
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,820
two is zero i

910
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:35,920
and then i get the sign

911
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:37,470
of cases

912
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,980
and i got the sign of getting

913
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,450
and that is the standing wave

914
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:48,110
all the spatial information is in here

915
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:50,790
and all the time information is there

916
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,350
and indeed if you substitute in this equals zero

917
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,450
the field is always zero this by the way

918
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:02,720
it is in the x direction

919
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,900
and so we have standing wave now

920
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,500
and what that means is

921
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,970
that there are surfaces

922
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,720
the direction of c

923
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:17,510
where the vector is always zero and the entire surface

924
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:20,500
we have no not all surface like this

925
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:22,390
they are separated

926
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:24,300
by distance one have lab

927
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,700
so this is a notable surface

928
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,720
this is also notable surface i'm trying to

929
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,710
draw the curve of the effect

930
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:36,870
sinusoidal curves only vector may be up here

931
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:37,700
and then

932
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,050
the factor

933
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:41,490
the down here

934
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:45,170
but it's all in the plane perpendicular to the blackwater same

935
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:49,550
so this is a notable surface this is notable so this is a notable surface

936
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:53,570
this is the wavelength and the vectors go like this

937
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,450
nothing is moving anymore in this direction it goes like this

938
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,310
standing wave

939
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,230
it was notable surfaces

940
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,090
so this spending electromagnetic wave

941
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:10,480
has an electric field which is standing

942
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:16,220
so there there is an associated magnetic field with this which is spending magnetic field

943
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,240
and i would like you to work that out and may even have put it

944
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,930
in one of my my problem sets

945
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:25,660
and what you find out much to use surprise certainly much to my surprise when

946
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,630
i saw his first

947
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:32,390
that the magnetic field is now ninety degrees out of phase with the electric field

948
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:35,530
both in space and in time

949
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:39,450
so that means where you have the nodal services in e

950
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:42,000
you have the entire notable services in b

951
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:47,700
and really feel free to the maximum you have that the magnetic field is zero

952
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,210
unlike travelling wave where the

953
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:55,160
magnetic fields and electric field in phase both in space and in time

954
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:57,420
now ninety degrees out of phase

955
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,950
when you think about that that is perhaps not so weird

956
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:06,100
because there cannot be any energy transport any net energy transport in one direction with

957
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,490
standing waves

958
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:12,950
and so the mean value of the poynting vector must be zero

959
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,200
and if you make a and b

960
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,510
ninety degrees out of phase

961
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:22,130
and there's always met so the mean vector of the point vector becomes any case

962
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,540
if you use maxwell's equations you'll see

963
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:26,550
that the magnetic field

964
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:34,090
he feels are ninety degrees out of phase ninety degrees in space and in time

965
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,540
i have here are famous

966
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,540
eighty eight

967
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:43,250
many problems and we have pf with everything

968
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:46,770
and we can see it and it

969
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:51,180
so the first thing was sleep SVM wants to reproduce the phenomena

970
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:55,910
and as you mentioned c is only parameter of linear SVM so we we try

971
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,080
to bury it

972
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,630
so what's happening

973
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,320
for some c settings has been we show

974
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:09,770
a performance dip when the civic feature vector size varies so with the figures on

975
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:11,920
the left

976
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:15,210
so we reproduce everything was labour's

977
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,720
and and then you have

978
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:18,700
hi c values here

979
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:23,020
which really much affected by the performance

980
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:28,020
and then a smaller c values here

981
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:33,330
which are almost not affected by the performance dip

982
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:52,700
no no

983
01:00:52,720 --> 01:01:01,090
OK can you can you repeat this this is this is clearly which is

984
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,930
coming out of this

985
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,240
first is

986
01:01:11,070 --> 01:01:16,470
this is

987
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:22,870
we can discuss it and so on

988
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,710
and i go on and then we can discuss it features

989
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:36,610
the next step is to relate this phenomena together with the number of features and

990
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,420
the number of training documents

991
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:45,410
so i we show the performance here include also you have look at films in

992
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,240
dark and high performance

993
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:49,900
in white and and then you also have

994
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:53,160
the relative performance you about sixty five percent

995
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:56,650
about seventy five eighty and then you get better performance

996
01:01:56,650 --> 01:02:02,000
so as you may expect with nice log shaped as performance

997
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:04,070
learning curve then

998
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,990
as more training to commence you have the better is the performance as what you

999
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:13,180
the mall features you have the better business you get that's

1000
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:17,730
quite quite regularly so was expectation

1001
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,810
i do this

1002
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:23,280
four sequence points are one here and and quite one hundred

1003
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:24,330
and and then here

1004
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:26,680
we see appeasers which is

1005
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:34,520
much more complex and that results as the characterization of all the performance dip

1006
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:45,440
and in the same way we see the correlation between the number of features the

1007
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:50,100
number of documents and the performances which is quite clear here

1008
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:54,140
so there is a relation ship between both

1009
01:02:54,140 --> 01:03:01,950
so for large c we have the performance the president is affected by the performance

1010
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:10,640
before the next step we define bounded and bounded support because it starts to be

1011
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,020
really technical

1012
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,160
four non been people it would be a bit technical

1013
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:23,140
and the solution is flat five where you give to each feature vector each

1014
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:24,810
document weight

1015
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,020
which which is between

1016
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:29,380
zero and c

1017
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:35,120
actually you just give the weight to to each feature vector line of your metrics

1018
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:39,430
and then you we have some of as wage which would be equal to zero

1019
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:43,920
because you don't care about those source feature vectors

1020
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,580
we call them inactive

1021
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:53,170
for those which are active active documents then that's the way it is strictly positive

1022
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:56,470
but then because we don't want to give a weight which is too important to

1023
01:03:56,470 --> 01:04:01,010
some some of the feature vectors we bound is by and

1024
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:02,010
which is

1025
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,230
what's what's called a soft margin support vector machines

1026
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:13,350
so then we will have two kinds of active support tools are active feature vectors

1027
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:15,910
unbounded ones unbounded ones

1028
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:21,180
i'm especially interested in cells which are bounded because that quite

1029
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:25,650
if i was giving a higher c value bound then they will run away

1030
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:27,310
so we just limit

1031
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:30,310
and then we reach is is about sources

1032
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:34,260
those the feature vector of a bit problematic

1033
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:40,640
you might expect that good been solution should have as it little bounded support vectors

1034
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:48,230
because that's clearly not the settings you like from the an SVM solution

1035
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,180
two steps

1036
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,820
o to characterize the performance dip there is the size of the feature vector

1037
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:57,060
and very tracking

1038
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:59,570
we study the nature of the SVM solution

1039
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:00,980
what i

1040
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:05,980
i mean by nature is listed in the bounded the proportion of bounded support vector

1041
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:08,530
energy momentum dependence of the

1042
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:13,580
effective charge the part the probability of radiation as a function of how violent the

1043
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,090
disturbance in the energy momentum flow

1044
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:17,770
the radiation makes

1045
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,910
and by that kind of experiments and by many many other kinds of experiments you

1046
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:23,230
can see

1047
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:26,450
this property of asymptotic freedom as the sole

1048
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:31,250
actually is correct and the car the

1049
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:37,380
predicted form of the variation is correct quantity

1050
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,820
that's the body and that's

1051
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,840
the story directly in the phenomenon

1052
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:44,260
how you establish

1053
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,380
the underlying theory

1054
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:51,670
we want the underlying theory to explain

1055
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:55,100
not only these jets but also the whole variety we want to make sure it's

1056
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:58,510
complete that describes everything about the strong interaction

1057
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:02,110
it is sort of all the non because it's a consistent theory that is so

1058
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:04,270
tight that you can change very much

1059
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,790
that's an aspect of its symmetry

1060
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,690
but perhaps there are things you could edit without changing the central core

1061
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:13,260
perhaps it's not

1062
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:16,540
entirely complete as the theory of the strong interactions

1063
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,630
to test that we wanted

1064
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:22,460
due to look at it and other applications

1065
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:25,870
and in any case we would like to understand the origin of mass that's not

1066
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:26,930
a bad thing

1067
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:31,110
so let's see if these ideas lead to an understanding of where mass comes from

1068
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:35,510
where the bulk of mass comes from and in particular as we reduce to two

1069
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,250
where the mass of protons and neutrons comes from

1070
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:46,670
because studying the masses of protons and neutrons intrinsically involves only small transfers of energy

1071
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:51,570
and momentum the protons and neutrons are built up from quarks that are moving around

1072
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:54,860
in conf

1073
01:06:54,910 --> 01:07:01,740
in circles so the constantly being deflected by small amounts

1074
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:06,190
there are very difficult to calculate their cope their copy the they are not

1075
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,200
in the regime of weak coupling and low

1076
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,040
momentum here

1077
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:11,750
let me

1078
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,710
the same word about the scale

1079
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,720
the scale is GV so the proton mass

1080
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,090
not accidentally

1081
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:20,690
is with the coupling is getting very large

1082
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:22,190
i will come back to that

1083
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,420
but in any case it indicates

1084
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:27,010
the approach

1085
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,980
trying to add up

1086
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:35,760
individual radiation events and see them one by one won't be sufficient to

1087
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:38,590
build up the structure of the proton you have

1088
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,810
infinitely many radiation events going on all

1089
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,630
to build up that structure

1090
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:52,230
to address that kind of question requires a much more elaborate kind of calculation

1091
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:55,810
and in fact these kinds of calculations have

1092
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:59,270
and continue to this day

1093
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:08,270
the frontiers of computer technology

1094
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:11,220
back in nineteen ninety three

1095
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,820
the frontiers of can computer technology

1096
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:19,700
displayed in the name of the bigger flop eleven

1097
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,630
computer g eleven

1098
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:26,710
which was something of the locker room size with gigantic fans in the basement of

1099
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:29,230
IBM yorktown heights

1100
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:34,040
now of course it's the sort of thing you could easily put on your desktop

1101
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:38,970
but g eleven was built specifically to try to get an estimate

1102
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:42,510
of what QCD predicts for the masses of particles

1103
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:47,930
and although we now realize that the estimates of the errors on these measurements were

1104
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:49,300
quite optimistic

1105
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:52,180
the pattern certainly was

1106
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,670
essentially correct

1107
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:59,190
closer to the state of the art in nineteen ninety eight is this machine which

1108
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:00,790
does terra flops

1109
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:06,770
calculations that is trillions of floating point multiplications per second

1110
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,750
and runs for years

1111
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,450
with that you build up

1112
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:17,310
calculation that has one parameter or i guess two parameters

1113
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:20,700
and overall coupling and the mass of the strange quark

1114
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:24,990
that builds up the mass of the observed particles this is the normalisation

1115
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:32,090
and then the rest are fit

1116
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:36,610
and you see that the result of the calculation compared with experiment

1117
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:39,520
are quite remarkably good

1118
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:44,020
even even though one is using terra flops

1119
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:47,450
is an approximation about that's why it is quenched QCD

1120
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:51,040
and it's believed and further exploration

1121
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:57,260
is very out that the residual errors are due to that approximation

1122
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,910
so one really does account for the mass

1123
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:05,080
the strongly interacting particles on the basis of the same fundamental theory that you see

1124
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,030
directly in the laboratory

1125
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:12,530
in the jet lap

1126
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:15,040
notice one of the entries here is

1127
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:22,800
that can't that stands for nucleon that stands for protons and neutrons

1128
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,220
the origin of mass is this

1129
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:28,270
the fact that

1130
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:36,670
you get the nucleon mass from this fundamental theory

1131
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:41,040
so let's see what went into it to get that mass

1132
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,440
at a fundamental level

1133
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,530
and see if it really does explain the origin of mass starting

1134
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:48,510
from no mass at all

1135
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:53,760
the ingredients of QCD that went into that calculations are

1136
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:57,010
massless gluons

1137
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:00,180
mass was up and down quarks

1138
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,110
and nothing else

1139
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:06,400
so i hope you'll agree that all these things are massless and so to get

1140
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:12,790
have explained that you've got a massive particle that the number of them out of

1141
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:16,260
particles with no mass at all

1142
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:20,910
but you notice there's an asterisk here

1143
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:22,580
because this isn't really

1144
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:25,750
this is QCD light

1145
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:31,600
a little joke there

1146
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:33,680
so to be honest

1147
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,280
and i'm always honest

1148
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,120
and then this thing here we go to zero we already know that this was

1149
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:42,940
i argue that we have sufficient consistency condition for

1150
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:48,020
so often you the tony because a few years the writing of the persistence is

1151
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:50,250
actually necessary and sufficient

1152
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:56,100
i worry about the city has the important thing here is that

1153
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,520
this is a condition

1154
01:11:57,570 --> 01:12:01,170
which takes into account the whole set of functions that can be implemented by the

1155
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:02,970
learning machine because here we have

1156
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:05,760
the supremum over the whole function class

1157
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,500
and of course it's

1158
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:11,840
it's difficult to take this work on learning machines if you are given some

1159
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:16,020
class of functions and you say OK now i'm going to empirical risk minimization on

1160
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,000
this path functions

1161
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:24,200
it will be hard to cheque for this kind of uniform convergence will take place

1162
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:29,200
so one would really like to have some further elaboration of some further conditions which

1163
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,950
will then in turn imply

1164
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,780
that this convergence would take place

1165
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,300
so the question is are there properties of learning machines

1166
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:39,320
all properties of set of functions

1167
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:43,520
which ensure that this kind of uniform convergence will take place

1168
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:47,510
because now we learned that if this in the uniform convergence takes place

1169
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:52,230
we have consistency will find so if this takes place that we know

1170
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:55,320
but as we see infinitely many training examples

1171
01:12:55,410 --> 01:13:00,620
we will be able to generalize will be will be able to do arbitrarily well

1172
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,580
so the difference between the training error

1173
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:06,500
tests are get arbitrarily small

1174
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,560
so therefore

1175
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:11,790
by minimizing the training error we would really be minimizing the test which is what

1176
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:13,530
we are interested in

1177
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:15,690
so now we have translated this problem

1178
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:17,640
into the problem of

1179
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:22,890
the convergence of the empirical risk to an actual risk

1180
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:25,260
on function classes

1181
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:31,760
these things are studied in model theory statistics called empirical processes

1182
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,200
OK so now

1183
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,700
let's take a little bit closer look

1184
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:39,690
the second is a closer look at this quantity

1185
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:41,220
this is that

1186
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:44,250
o thing that we want to go to zero

1187
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:47,270
and the second of is how do we prove that this

1188
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:51,770
we're going to use the telephone

1189
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:53,690
OK first of all

1190
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,240
if i class

1191
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:57,450
contains only one function

1192
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:00,980
then we can directly apply the general because if we have only one function in

1193
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,420
this class f

1194
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:05,050
and this isn't really is supremo

1195
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:05,980
we can just

1196
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:07,550
drop that part here

1197
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:10,700
so then we are only interested in the probability that

1198
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:11,870
the difference between

1199
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:13,810
training error and test error

1200
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,540
larger than epsilon

1201
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:21,330
already shown you before the channel also of the problem we can directly plug in

1202
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:25,040
and we get this nice and fast exponential decay

1203
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:26,860
of the difference

1204
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:28,220
so that's my

1205
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,980
and the way we work now is

1206
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:35,400
if we have more than one function but only finitely many functions

1207
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,590
we can do a little modification of his argument

1208
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:39,790
and and we get

1209
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,390
something which is almost as good will not

1210
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:46,620
if we have n functions we just get the factor in which appears here

1211
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:50,090
and this doesn't cost as much because it appears here

1212
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:54,730
and we still that the exponential decay and whatever this number in

1213
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:58,240
the exponential decay will win against it so we want to get the

1214
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,200
so we get the convergence

1215
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:04,430
in the next case will be if we have infinitely many

1216
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,590
such functions

1217
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:09,000
then the main idea would be that

1218
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:12,770
on any finite sample of observations that we might see

1219
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:16,990
but even if we have interested many functions they will appear as if they were

1220
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:18,600
financially many

1221
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:21,770
because there only two possible outputs of the functions

1222
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,080
if you have only finitely many points on which we test those functions

1223
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,970
and effectively of function class is finite

1224
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:34,770
and then we will be able to use the term of bond in the second

1225
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,250
life that's

1226
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:38,820
roughly speaking the outline for the next

1227
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:40,990
ten minutes hopefully

1228
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,540
so let's first look at this case of

1229
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:49,460
finally many functions in fact i won't the case initially of two functions

1230
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:52,670
so if we have one function we can plug in china directly what happens if

1231
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:55,000
we have two functions

1232
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:57,960
of functions as the phase these two functions

1233
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,940
we are interested in this quantity here

1234
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:01,980
so let's just rewrite it

1235
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,960
we can rewrite this the probability that

1236
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:08,920
this thing happens at the probability of two sets

1237
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:11,910
remember this was the probability of all

1238
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,490
samples of n samples

1239
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:19,170
so this was the probability that i'm drawing pairs of observations

1240
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:25,660
with the property that test error and training artist something different

1241
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:26,640
so when

1242
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:29,250
with the supremum over the function class

1243
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
at least

1244
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:33,500
epsilon different in this case you will be

1245
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,580
the case

1246
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,090
i vote for the first function

1247
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:40,940
or the second function or both of them

1248
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:44,500
we have at the different of these epsilon

1249
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,400
so here

1250
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,700
this event

1251
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,780
i epsilon denotes the case

1252
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:55,400
for the function i we have different of what is the size of the business

1253
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,910
the case that we are drawing through a sample of points

1254
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:01,970
with the property that training error

1255
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:06,910
test error different please sign on this country by

1256
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:09,580
the union of these two

1257
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:13,170
the function one for the function to

1258
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:17,390
well then give us exactly this event here that the supremum of the a function

1259
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:18,820
class of this two

1260
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,430
this function cos theta functions

1261
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,890
would be used

1262
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:25,760
some different

1263
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,180
OK so maybe

1264
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:30,770
if you don't get it completely could afterwards but it's actually

1265
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,670
number difficult thing

1266
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:37,290
so we can rewrite this as the probability of this event

1267
01:17:39,870 --> 01:17:41,760
just a little aside

1268
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,940
it's not important if you have noticed it and just ignore it but

1269
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:49,690
i use the convention that i have said over here

1270
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:54,240
i use round brackets for the probability of that set

1271
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:57,160
and if i have like a logical formula here

1272
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:59,980
use these curly brackets

1273
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:03,440
it is going to say i can only have stable equilibrium

1274
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:06,500
the sum of all forces equals zero

1275
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:08,420
and if the sum of all works

1276
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:09,530
relative to

1277
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:11,710
and want

1278
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,690
equal zero

1279
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,440
and nature knows how to do that

1280
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,670
always will happen

1281
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:21,480
if the

1282
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,980
in the centre of mass are

1283
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:26,980
along the vertical line

1284
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:29,110
because if that's the case

1285
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:31,020
then there will be here

1286
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:33,260
force and g

1287
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,840
and then will be a force mg upwards

1288
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,480
this object is hanging on that

1289
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,230
the action equals minus reaction

1290
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:44,940
push upwards

1291
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:48,170
so to sum of all forces is zero

1292
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:49,550
and there is no talk

1293
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:53,650
take any point you want to this point that point at this point that point

1294
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,070
that point

1295
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:57,230
there is no talk anymore so now

1296
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,750
there is complete equilibrium

1297
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,250
so if you had an object for instance that look like this

1298
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,980
thin rod

1299
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:08,230
a very massive object here centre of mass

1300
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,730
almost there

1301
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:12,050
then in this situation

1302
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:15,320
will be stable

1303
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,590
or you might say

1304
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:21,940
this situation

1305
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:23,150
because now

1306
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:24,860
we have the centre of mass

1307
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:30,260
so also here

1308
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,590
we have now

1309
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:33,320
g down

1310
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,090
so we have the pin and you

1311
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:39,170
sum of all forces is zero

1312
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:40,900
some of the talks is zero

1313
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:45,570
but there's a big difference between this situation the situation which you really feel your

1314
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:46,880
stomach of course

1315
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:49,750
and that is the this is highly unstable

1316
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:50,900
if you

1317
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:52,800
just below this a little

1318
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,730
it will swing over it will

1319
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:57,300
start to rotate residents stable

1320
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,840
if i move this to decide

1321
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,960
welcome back

1322
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,230
to that position

1323
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:06,710
but the basic idea is that the centre of mass

1324
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:09,210
will always stable configuration

1325
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:11,050
line itself out below

1326
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:12,400
the point of

1327
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,730
i have here

1328
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:19,670
the triangle

1329
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:22,690
and i have no clue where the centre of mass is

1330
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:24,710
somewhere here

1331
01:20:24,710 --> 01:20:27,670
it may even be an open space i don't know

1332
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:31,690
what i can do now i can suspend it like this

1333
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:33,880
and i know that the centre of mass

1334
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,070
must be below my finger

1335
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:37,090
if you notice

1336
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:40,190
it's actually rotate it

1337
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:44,250
sort of the centre of mass aligned itself precisely below my finger so i can

1338
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:46,480
now take

1339
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:48,860
and so and draw a line here

1340
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,840
or i can a little

1341
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:54,610
and i can change my finger to here

1342
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:58,400
and i can again draw this line and where the two intersect is the centre

1343
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,170
of mass

1344
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:01,750
the centre of mass will always find itself

1345
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:04,260
the point of suspension

1346
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:06,530
now i think piece of body

1347
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:08,980
and i put piece of body here

1348
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,690
and clearly i changed the location of the centre of mass quite substantially

1349
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:17,070
must have shifted enormously in this direction

1350
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:18,840
whereas the centre of mass

1351
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:20,360
i have no clue

1352
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,630
but look

1353
01:21:22,690 --> 01:21:24,320
balance it here

1354
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,670
centre of mass must now be

1355
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:29,190
somewhere here

1356
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:31,750
i balance it here

1357
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,230
centre of mass

1358
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:34,760
must be somewhere here

1359
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,380
where the two lines intersect

1360
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,360
could be

1361
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:38,530
in his opening

1362
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:39,420
that's where

1363
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:42,820
the centre of mass is located

1364
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,590
so it's easy experimentally

1365
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:48,500
to find the centre of mass early in the course we calculate it

1366
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:52,360
where the centre of mass was perhaps you remember that when we had very special

1367
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,940
geometrical configurations i mentioned to you then already

1368
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:57,210
that the highways

1369
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,250
you can experimentally determine it

1370
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:00,230
and that

1371
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:04,050
can be done very easily way i just showed you

1372
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:10,230
i want to show you some examples of static equilibrium

1373
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:14,730
which are not so intuitive

1374
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:17,590
you may have seen some of you may actually have

1375
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:23,030
if i take a pencil

1376
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:27,670
i think my pocket knife

1377
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,730
he was a pencil

1378
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:32,610
i'll show it to you shortly

1379
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:35,380
just regular pencil

1380
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,530
my pocket knife and i put the knife jazmine i've

1381
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:46,030
this is the knife

1382
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:47,840
and this

1383
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,980
is now

1384
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:56,340
like so

1385
01:22:56,360 --> 01:23:00,550
this arrangement can easily be made such that the centre of mass is below

1386
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:02,550
this point

1387
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,130
so if now i

1388
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:05,570
one my finger

1389
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:07,210
i can balance

1390
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:14,670
the fluctuation downward one of about twenty five percent worldwide in every market it exceeds

1391
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:19,400
what you will ever find with gaussian random walk exceeded simply because

1392
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:26,530
to take this many steps this many successive scales in the drugs quite has exponentially

1393
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:30,820
low probability of ten to the minus three hundred forty seven

1394
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,380
number one ever like to say never

1395
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:36,470
i think ten to the minus three hundred forty seven is about as close to

1396
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:38,210
numbers you can ever get

1397
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:42,220
and and this is another way simply will not happen

1398
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:45,440
most of the time this does very well in many of you know

1399
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:46,300
that this

1400
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:52,970
by showing the work of over one hundred years ago it forms the basis used

1401
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:59,650
trading models and all the markets of the world and i and even if we

1402
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:04,250
don't care about the money of other people we may forget that our own pensions

1403
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:08,240
are tied up in this money and we may forget that even if we don't

1404
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,250
have any money or care of everyone else's money that we're going to lose our

1405
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:20,820
this model in short is very very good but not good for rare events so

1406
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:27,420
there already is a little bifurcations economies could be as economists prefer theory

1407
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:31,610
and this is a few rare events and they use words like salami

1408
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:32,940
to describe them

1409
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:37,990
the first such a theory than to worry about the real data especially when the

1410
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:42,990
rare events are exceedingly rare one in fifty years but we didn't actually it's a

1411
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:47,320
little more than one hundred fifty years because if we simply subtract

1412
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:48,430
the price

1413
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:51,540
at one time interval from the price

1414
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:53,470
ten minutes earlier

1415
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:56,650
we have a quantity that usually called returns

1416
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:59,790
is return on your investment ten minutes later

1417
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:04,590
and this galaxy and of course is all those e to the minus x squared

1418
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,260
and e to the minus twenty five is already so small that you don't see

1419
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:17,120
returns that are more than five standard deviations one minus five standard deviations everyone is

1420
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:22,220
sandwiched in this region for the time intervals but now it's not forty years thirteen

1421
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:28,200
in contrast the real data display not only the very rare event

1422
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:31,840
black monday october nineteen eighty seven

1423
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,210
but also quite a number of other events

1424
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:35,360
and in fact

1425
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:38,980
if we use a piece of experimental equipment there

1426
01:25:38,990 --> 01:25:42,340
our mothers gave to all of us which is two eyeballs

1427
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,390
you can actually just use one eyeball

1428
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,930
you can see a power law

1429
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:51,210
for these fluctuations and how can you do that you can count how many

1430
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:56,960
fluctuations larger than twenty standard deviation there is only one black monday

1431
01:25:56,990 --> 01:26:01,460
and you can count how many are larger than ten standard deviations and believe it

1432
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,630
or not you get exactly eight

1433
01:26:04,330 --> 01:26:06,450
ten is happening twenty

1434
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,130
and h is true

1435
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:09,590
the power three

1436
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,880
so already we see a cubic power law

1437
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:16,450
and if we want to check it we can count how many are more than

1438
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:21,680
five standard deviations again lo and behold we get exactly sixty four sixty four is

1439
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:22,810
a time state

1440
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:29,770
and so once again we have the standard deviations we get two q as many

1441
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:35,070
so you can already see a power law with the i and q one in

1442
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:36,720
principle could stop right now

1443
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:41,880
but you would convince anybody know that's not even a physicist or gullible but certainly

1444
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,320
not a mathematician

1445
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,620
who's love to make fun of the

1446
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,810
methods that physicists use

1447
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:49,490
two major discoveries

1448
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:54,110
before we leave this slide and look at something a little more complicated let's continue

1449
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:56,060
to use our mothers present

1450
01:26:56,130 --> 01:27:00,740
among those present was the idea and with the eye you can see some things

1451
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:06,570
that actually were known by economists toward by kind of as they discover the first

1452
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:11,340
but they've been pushed a bit further by physicists the first is that the returns

1453
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:14,470
are not going every economist knows this

1454
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:18,810
the question is how important think it is but they definitely know this is no

1455
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:23,350
sense in which physicists discovered that these returns and i guess you

1456
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:29,330
and the second thing that economists knew full well is that the large events cluster

1457
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:33,480
such as by monday around like money there are quite a few other very volatile

1458
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:37,370
days and there is a period of calm in the budget volatility that a long

1459
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:38,970
period of volatility

1460
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:43,440
and so forth and this so-called volatility clustering

1461
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:47,940
it is not qualitatively for a long time

1462
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:53,130
what physicists have added and i will discuss this later so just say now

1463
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:56,480
is that for every one of these big shocks

1464
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:04,020
there little aftershocks just as in the earthquake blackwell last month after the earthquake we

1465
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:07,250
all know they were aftershocks in these aftershocks

1466
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:12,850
i have a mathematical properties were first studied hundred years ago by more

1467
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:21,580
and and and a graduate student in palermo fabrizio below working with his advisor professor

1468
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:25,880
maintain you applied to this

1469
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:31,350
the same mathematics maury that all more had applied

1470
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,440
to the

1471
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:36,940
problem of real earthquakes and found the same sorts of laws

1472
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,880
quite interesting is that if the markets have these

1473
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:46,570
a quantitative features in common with earthquakes and very recently professor have in this room

1474
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:50,030
working with three of my students

1475
01:28:52,610 --> 01:29:01,110
the possibility that the aftershocks themselves have aftershocks and those internet more aftershocks sort of

1476
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:02,160
the way that

1477
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:07,710
the poetry goes for turbulence that began eastbourne ladies and lindisfarne

1478
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:13,650
ladies and so on information and and this is a picture of a sort of

1479
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:20,500
self similarity is a qualitative picture that makes one immediately think scale free phenomena in

1480
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:26,450
economics and here is where the biggest bone of contention probably exists with a really

1481
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:30,810
genuine hard-core economists that there should be or even could be

1482
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:31,940
scale free

1483
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:37,510
properties in economics they are reluctant to accept that because the evidence is not of

1484
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,620
the calibre

1485
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:45,150
they would consider acceptable because they hardcore mathematicians who do do not accept the sort

1486
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:45,640
of thing

1487
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,360
plot for the show

1488
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:48,650
type of

1489
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:52,040
i suppose i want to redraw this because this has been

1490
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:55,990
drawn at right angles its colloquial we know this thing zigzagging one

1491
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,600
so i want to redraw the two beauty

1492
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,750
and so began by putting double bond

1493
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:02,800
and then

1494
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:06,630
that means i have to have a hundred twenty degree angles

1495
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:10,430
and what turns out here is that the double bond goes to

1496
01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:14,080
carbon which has a hydrogen on one side

1497
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:16,460
and on the other side has

1498
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,520
the manifold group

1499
01:30:18,590 --> 01:30:22,210
and the same thing here so now i have a choice what i can do

1500
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:24,260
is i can click the manifold group

1501
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:25,470
up here

1502
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:28,400
and hydraulic redraw this

1503
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:30,200
well it does read rather

1504
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:33,740
the the two beauty

1505
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:40,090
and i think you can see that i can put a

1506
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:42,110
a symmetry plane here

1507
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:43,850
thank you for symmetry plane

1508
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:47,050
and what wife what do i have i've got all my

1509
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,510
i got both of my

1510
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:54,130
methyl groups above the carbon carbon double bond and all the hydrogens below

1511
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:57,940
the carbon carbon double bond but another way i could have

1512
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:02,740
set up the structure again there's the carbon carbon double bond let's put the a

1513
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:05,720
hundred twenty three degree angles will put

1514
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:11,900
the groups above the carbon carbon bond on the left side but below the carbon

1515
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:16,330
carbon bond on the right side and then we'll do the complementary

1516
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:18,210
positioning with the hydrogen

1517
01:31:18,230 --> 01:31:22,400
so in the case on the right which is also a two beauty

1518
01:31:22,450 --> 01:31:25,230
it's also to butane

1519
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:31,700
we can see as real time warner's we look at structure structure is really important

1520
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:35,070
to us and we say OK same constituent groups but

1521
01:31:35,110 --> 01:31:37,090
what you can tell

1522
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:40,760
the electron distribution is going to be different and the one on the left from

1523
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,240
the one on the right

1524
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:44,610
so you start thinking well

1525
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:48,920
what about their properties guess what they have different melting points they have different boiling

1526
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:52,350
points they have different as you can see the impact differently

1527
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:55,680
so all this and yet they have the same chemical formula

1528
01:31:56,380 --> 01:32:00,480
we have to distinguish these two they're not differ by

1529
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:05,930
their constitution but they are different by their spatial layout and the time that we

1530
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:11,880
use to talk about i some that are different in their spatial layout spatial arrangement

1531
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,130
is stereo isomers stereo ice

1532
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:18,640
they are constitutionally identical but

1533
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,600
structurally different

1534
01:32:21,290 --> 01:32:24,430
constitutionally identical

1535
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:36,890
identical constitution different spatial

1536
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:45,020
so we got labels on this the the one on the right

1537
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,360
to indicate that

1538
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:53,270
the various groups are on opposite sides of the double bond is called trans

1539
01:32:53,290 --> 01:32:57,320
trans so the structure on the right is trans two team

1540
01:32:57,350 --> 01:33:00,270
we're one on the left is

1541
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:01,600
two beauty

1542
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:03,200
so now we met

1543
01:33:03,230 --> 01:33:05,720
stereo isomers and

1544
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:07,210
we know what the

1545
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:10,610
this one of the things we can have more than one double bond as well

1546
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:13,750
we can have more than one double bond

1547
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,600
in now king

1548
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:18,140
more than one

1549
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:20,190
o double bond in

1550
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:21,600
l here

1551
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,380
and we'll need a few these as well we talk about palmer's if we have

1552
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:30,130
this is called a die mean

1553
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:33,400
and if we have three it's called a

1554
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,900
look at these so so for example we could do something like this was i

1555
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:44,570
gave image you don't mind i'm going to put the age and the inside you

1556
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:46,640
forgive me this OK right

1557
01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:49,670
you know the ages are on board which is going see

1558
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:53,920
what else

1559
01:33:54,300 --> 01:34:04,950
OK so what we do with this one i'm not going to give you this

1560
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:07,790
to ten name i just want to see how it works in all

1561
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:12,340
make sure that we focus on the chemistry but just for the record one two

1562
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:15,530
three four five five so it's got to be and

1563
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:17,690
is something pants

1564
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:23,290
got to be in e e because there's atleast one double bond here

1565
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:24,980
and there are two

1566
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,580
this is going to be up

1567
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:29,760
died in

1568
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:33,140
and to die and furthermore we can say this is

1569
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:34,640
this is

1570
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:38,320
carbon number one carbon number two number three

1571
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:44,150
four number five in the double bonds issued from carbon number one and carbon number

1572
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:47,010
three so we can call this one three

1573
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:48,420
to die

1574
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:50,650
so now you see how

1575
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:52,520
how all of this

1576
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:54,690
works and it's not so bad

1577
01:34:54,710 --> 01:34:59,490
radicals what happens if we want to use just the piece of one of these

1578
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:04,540
so the only one that the comes up that well there's two actually one of

1579
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:05,580
them comes from

1580
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:08,010
from philly graphically

1581
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:12,260
going put the hydrogen is to indicate when i don't have one summer break his

1582
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:17,080
born throw away the hydrogen and use this so this is the radical that comes

1583
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:24,990
well you might say well what we call the since the formal name and when

1584
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,430
use the u pacman fifteen

1585
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:30,960
well we can't say apple because apple is already taken

1586
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:32,400
as well as the

1587
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,250
so that's helpful just to know

1588
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:37,840
because sometimes i get questions later on word people will say

1589
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:40,950
we showed it was like the big show was log v

1590
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,320
like to point out that

1591
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,940
the various ways of representing graphs

1592
01:35:56,690 --> 01:36:01,430
i'm going to cover a couple of the important ones is actually more we'll see

1593
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:02,790
some more

1594
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:09,850
so the simplest one is what's called an adjacency matrix

1595
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:13,810
and jason

1596
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:15,180
j a

1597
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:25,170
the adjacency matrix

1598
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:27,840
after all the

1599
01:36:30,850 --> 01:36:36,070
for simplicity i'll let t be the set of

1600
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:38,740
majors from one

1601
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:41,260
up to and

1602
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:44,830
it is the

1603
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:46,800
and by an

1604
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:50,460
matrix a

1605
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:55,350
given by

1606
01:36:55,510 --> 01:37:00,340
the i j entry

1607
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:04,590
it's simply one if the edge i j

1608
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:09,330
is in the edge set

1609
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:10,770
one zero

1610
01:37:10,780 --> 01:37:12,560
if i j

1611
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:16,590
it is not in the edge set

1612
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:20,320
OK so simply the matrix where you say

1613
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:24,540
the idea that entry is one if it's in the matrix is in some sense

1614
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:25,570
giving you

1615
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:30,180
the predicate for is there an edge from i to j

1616
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:33,240
OK predicate memories of boolean formula

1617
01:37:34,370 --> 01:37:37,490
is either zero or one and

1618
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:41,420
and in this case you're saying it's one if there's no

1619
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:43,210
edge from i to j

1620
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:45,590
and zero otherwise

1621
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:50,220
in our sometimes you have weighted graphs

1622
01:37:50,230 --> 01:37:56,680
edge weighted graphs and then sometimes what people do is replace this by edge weights

1623
01:37:56,690 --> 01:37:59,330
OK to be the weight of the edge from i to j

1624
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:03,270
so let's just do a an example of that

1625
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,340
just to make sure that our intuition corresponds

1626
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:20,310
two are mathematical definitions here's an example graph

1627
01:38:20,390 --> 01:38:25,040
say that's are

1628
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:30,440
so i was just across the

1629
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:33,020
adjacency matrix

1630
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:39,920
so this is an edge from

1631
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:42,140
the from one to one

1632
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:43,760
the answer is no

1633
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:45,530
from one to two

1634
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,880
i learned from one to three

1635
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:53,310
and h from one to four

1636
01:38:54,690 --> 01:38:55,780
image from

1637
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:57,740
two to one

1638
01:38:58,500 --> 01:38:59,760
two to two

1639
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:01,810
two to three

1640
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:05,560
two to four

1641
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,310
no edges going out of three

1642
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:14,850
ge from four two

1643
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:19,610
three and that's it that's the adjacency matrix

1644
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:24,200
for this particular graph

1645
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:31,020
so i can represent graph as this adjacency matrix

1646
01:39:31,610 --> 01:39:33,960
what are represented in this way

1647
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:39,980
how much storage do i need

1648
01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:41,440
OK and squared error

1649
01:39:41,450 --> 01:39:43,630
for the square because

1650
01:39:43,650 --> 01:39:45,970
the size is the same thing

1651
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:48,200
scored storage

1652
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:52,830
and that's what we call a dance

1653
01:39:56,170 --> 01:40:04,170
OK it works well when the graph is dense so the graph is dense if

1654
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:05,900
the number of edges

1655
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:08,960
is close to

1656
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:11,960
all the edges possible

1657
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:16,840
then this is a good representation but for many types of graphs the number of

1658
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:19,550
edges is much less

1659
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:24,160
then the number the possible number of edges

1660
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:27,370
in which case we see the graph is parts can somebody give me an example

1661
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:29,590
of a sparse graphs

1662
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:34,280
l class of graphs solomon class of graphs that is n grows

1663
01:40:34,330 --> 01:40:35,900
the number of edges

1664
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:40,030
in the graph doesn't grow is the square but grows rather

1665
01:40:40,090 --> 01:40:41,180
as the

1666
01:40:41,330 --> 01:40:45,310
it has some things in a much smaller

1667
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:48,130
linked list so the chain

1668
01:40:48,130 --> 01:40:53,130
so what i want to talk to you today about is actually something

1669
01:40:53,150 --> 01:40:57,300
something completely different something different in terms of what it is

1670
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,830
probably the most

1671
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:04,600
focused upon a dimensional aspect of statistical machine learning

1672
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:07,110
it's really not what i'm talking about today

1673
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,000
that is

1674
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:11,010
a lot of statistical machine learning is about

1675
01:41:11,030 --> 01:41:13,920
are induction inference over

1676
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:15,650
attribute space

1677
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:20,650
in structural pattern recognition that's not the case that is we

1678
01:41:20,670 --> 01:41:24,390
i have a very rich structures that we have to deal with in images

1679
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:26,840
and and senses

1680
01:41:26,850 --> 01:41:28,120
and we have to

1681
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:34,880
work on our that can learn to summarise generalized and optimal inference

1682
01:41:34,890 --> 01:41:37,850
over data structures that are much richer

1683
01:41:37,870 --> 01:41:40,470
and simply vector spaces

1684
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,100
so i want to give you some

1685
01:41:42,110 --> 01:41:45,390
insight into this wrong literature

1686
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:51,220
on what's called structural pattern recognition sometimes called syntactic pattern recognition

1687
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:54,530
and that really is the interface between statistics

1688
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,940
logic programming and a sort of areas

1689
01:41:58,950 --> 01:42:00,600
so it's a symbolic

1690
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,510
and numerical

1691
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:06,910
and that's needed is i hope to convince you to solve many many many problems

1692
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:09,630
in complex signal processing

1693
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:13,950
and that's what i want to get over today and tomorrow and over some of

1694
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:18,570
the techniques that have been developed over the last fifty years

1695
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:22,310
to solve these types of problems

1696
01:42:22,330 --> 01:42:26,780
so some of you come for example from logic programming background to be metaphors to

1697
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:29,660
what's called inductive logic programming

1698
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:34,410
the second is to come from city background that we could be

1699
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:37,020
uses of bayesian network inference

1700
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:40,820
and this is how to bring these things together in usable systems is the theme

1701
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:44,130
of these these lectures

1702
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:48,930
not to overemphasize

1703
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:54,570
structural pattern making structures are defined by attributed part and relationships

1704
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,900
so contrary to what you think

1705
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:59,900
ninety percent of papers

1706
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:01,770
published in the

1707
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:04,960
in many the computer vision journals don't trade

1708
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:09,360
patterns all structures as a groups of of pixels

1709
01:43:09,370 --> 01:43:10,610
i already

1710
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:13,200
extract features

1711
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:16,960
and from two thousand images you have all other attributes

1712
01:43:19,770 --> 01:43:21,590
there are indexed

1713
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:25,550
so for example in describing upon the lillies

1714
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:31,330
you want a system that can actually insane states that english phrase

1715
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:36,470
well that is what the distribu headlines juxtaposed to each other have about the leaves

1716
01:43:36,470 --> 01:43:42,240
and flowers and all those things not simply i thirty two by thirty two arriving

1717
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:46,550
of RGB values that's pretty useless

1718
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:49,620
may be useful for initial preprocessed

1719
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,970
but to generate or structural description

1720
01:43:51,990 --> 01:43:55,450
i need features attributes labels

1721
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:59,020
so that structural pattern recognition

1722
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:02,310
so where does it come in my goodness

1723
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:07,090
just about everywhere every every aspect of for example computer vision

1724
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:14,460
component description of objects content based queries in the sense real content

1725
01:44:15,050 --> 01:44:19,870
correspondence so often in in in in binocular vision

1726
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:26,800
computer vision systems you have to solve the correspondence between disparity parts to infer that

1727
01:44:26,830 --> 01:44:31,390
first example of matching now two two sets of features

1728
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:37,180
often for example in medical image processing in photogrammetric you have to align images by

1729
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:46,770
learning parts by learning features fetching and doing various types of morphological not find transformation

1730
01:44:46,770 --> 01:44:50,370
based on the correspondences of features

1731
01:44:50,390 --> 01:44:53,840
motion tracking where correspondence is not

1732
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:58,950
you probably heard when a talk about motion correspondence you probably saw a few days

1733
01:44:58,950 --> 01:45:03,210
ago that we probably so in order to work on the assumption is you've solve

1734
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:07,100
this thing is a product guassian process is independent across features

1735
01:45:09,130 --> 01:45:10,170
with a linear kernel

1736
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:16,500
so what that's saying is well when viewing piece e eight is if you've got

1737
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:19,120
a bunch of bayesian linear regressions over

1738
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:20,460
some outputs

1739
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:27,010
you don't know the inputs but piece ieee is finding the best inputs for predicting those outputs

1740
01:45:28,690 --> 01:45:32,070
this is what this model is say fine i've got a bunch of outputs

1741
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:37,190
ants i want to know what input generated those outputs and i'm going look for

1742
01:45:37,190 --> 01:45:41,560
the best ones on the likes likelihood given that my mapping is a bayesian linear

1743
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:43,980
regression that's the dual piece yet so

1744
01:45:44,590 --> 01:45:45,760
how do we make it linear

1745
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:51,430
non linear kernel there

1746
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:56,030
so that's actually the exact same trick is going on and can appreciate

1747
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,290
but i can appreciate

1748
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:01,300
the igon value problem

1749
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:04,770
why why transpose is replaced by a kernel

1750
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,580
hear x x transpose

1751
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,820
latent variables

1752
01:46:09,310 --> 01:46:11,050
mappings going in the opposite direction

1753
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:12,850
can appreciate

1754
01:46:13,530 --> 01:46:14,920
has a unique solution

1755
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:16,220
up to a rotation

1756
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:17,740
this does not

1757
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:24,190
it has a very nasty nonlinear optimization so you replace the kernel with the nonlinear

1758
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:29,100
kernel no longer have an i can value problem but because the probabilistic interpretation what

1759
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:31,960
you have is to have a kernel with a shedload parameters

1760
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:34,400
those parameters are the inputs

1761
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:36,190
you've got all the end

1762
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:40,550
q parameters plus any other parameters you chose you kernel actually

1763
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:44,000
lengthscale inactive redundant parameter in the grammar article

1764
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,780
grammar grammar are

1765
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:49,250
because they appeared together yeah

1766
01:46:49,930 --> 01:46:54,560
but actually i find in practice i often using both just a so the alking scale right

1767
01:46:56,380 --> 01:46:57,070
this point

1768
01:46:59,050 --> 01:47:02,880
i i have like a choose your own adventure i guess you guys you're the

1769
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,370
playstation generation so you never read choose your own adventure books

1770
01:47:09,010 --> 01:47:12,100
there were these dumb box and you need the page and it says if you

1771
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:16,050
do this code page forty seven and if you do not go to page fifty

1772
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:22,960
anything you wanted and trying to invert it together

1773
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:27,120
because life is what would say you die horribly even by the monster

1774
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:33,840
that's what we had to do before we had powerful computers

1775
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:40,430
just think they had the machine learning the goal that statistics

1776
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:43,190
also it turned out

1777
01:47:45,490 --> 01:47:46,080
okay so

1778
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:49,590
by the time i some demos

1779
01:47:52,630 --> 01:47:54,050
okay so uh this

1780
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:01,130
so you know you've already seen i love that's man so he's gonna come up again

1781
01:48:03,670 --> 01:48:06,420
okay so the stick man data let's have a look at it again

1782
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:07,870
there's a stigma running

1783
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:10,040
nineteen ninety are

1784
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:24,960
get there

1785
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:29,260
o is they

1786
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:30,680
head daejeon

1787
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:32,000
on the data

1788
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,380
it's quite nice actually disappointingly good this

1789
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:37,800
when i read it

1790
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:41,410
okay so

1791
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:45,160
something slightly confusing is this gonna be to defend

1792
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:47,760
is computing a background grayscale

1793
01:48:48,850 --> 01:48:49,920
o it doesn't come out very well

1794
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:51,310
them okay so

1795
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:53,900
that's annoying

1796
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:57,990
what you see in the latent space is the gritting had a massive grading together

1797
01:48:58,450 --> 01:49:01,490
nicely as the blue line that does this circle here

1798
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:04,310
is a jump actually a big jump

1799
01:49:04,770 --> 01:49:06,780
so the circles right there then jumps across there

1800
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:11,600
because outlines coming in there so it's not a fully formed circle so it's difficult to see

1801
01:49:12,130 --> 01:49:14,910
the background grayscale is is actually trying to indicate

1802
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:21,640
jacobian manifold is trying to indicate when the manifolds being walked quickly and actually it's

1803
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:25,980
pretty constant across here it's not being bent too much better way of trying to

1804
01:49:25,980 --> 01:49:31,200
visualize when there's a lot of strong bending the manifold that they call magnification factors

1805
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:34,680
i'm gonna be different from the gray scale used the end

1806
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:37,520
but what we can do with these models in this

1807
01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:41,830
as we can make our little man

1808
01:49:43,030 --> 01:49:43,820
always had gone

1809
01:49:45,730 --> 01:49:48,010
otherwise it's not looking more like a visit

1810
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:51,180
we can make a run

1811
01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:56,480
and we can even get angle that's the thing i loved about when i first

1812
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:59,720
in the jubilee and i'm unfortunately showing it to with the duty and first

1813
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:01,720
so the angle yeah

1814
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:02,900
that's why

1815
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:05,380
these lines should not be on top of each other

1816
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:07,860
you can make and dance

1817
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:09,420
raise okay

1818
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:15,170
it doesn't know anything about constraints on the man so looking back is is legs his feet got too big

1819
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:19,810
he can take into unusual positions

1820
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:25,030
but if you say because the data you don't quite know where the data is

1821
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:29,150
so thanks to jim guess he's he's gone

1822
01:50:29,230 --> 01:50:33,090
so good morning i'm showing back off from university of manchester

1823
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:37,220
so what i'm going to talk about over the next i guess what forty forty

1824
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:39,540
five minutes is going to be much more

1825
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:43,390
so what's the big o and things the germans just kind of introduced and taught

1826
01:50:45,350 --> 01:50:49,280
one of the giant is is give you an overview of some of the ideas

1827
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:50,330
behind OWL

1828
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:55,550
OK i'll be in the an ontology language designed from the start the semantic web

1829
01:50:56,690 --> 01:51:01,590
in the time available clearly one can kind of give all the details such language

1830
01:51:01,610 --> 01:51:04,550
know forty minutes is not is not enough time to do that what i'm going

1831
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:08,610
to try and do is give you a feel for some of the motivation behind

1832
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:09,650
the choices that are in there

1833
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:12,690
and also a little bit of the details of the language so that you can

1834
01:51:12,690 --> 01:51:15,830
go and chase them yourselves

1835
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:20,220
this is probably too much material in this slide valve get through but tends to

1836
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:23,870
some of the things that you can look at kind of offline but the idea

1837
01:51:23,870 --> 01:51:27,260
with this is to give you some of the motivation behind OWL and some details

1838
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:31,170
of the language so some of the things i'll say what kind of resonate with

1839
01:51:31,170 --> 01:51:35,940
what was just introduced and hopefully will encounter things that people talk about later on

1840
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:37,720
during the day

1841
01:51:37,730 --> 01:51:41,690
so some of this is going to not for this is kind of

1842
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:44,810
to a certain extent motherhood and apple pie for people who are kind of involved

1843
01:51:44,810 --> 01:51:48,920
in the semantic web world we've got this notion that the original kind of first

1844
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:54,170
generation web is very much enabled by the use of standard some standard infrastructure that

1845
01:51:54,170 --> 01:51:57,390
might people to build applications on top of it so we have to understand the

1846
01:51:57,390 --> 01:52:02,950
mechanisms to transport standard mechanism for representation things like HTML TCP IP and so on

1847
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:07,280
and this made it easier for people to build some applications on top the would

1848
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:09,510
inter operate OK

1849
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:11,090
but the

1850
01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:16,440
the first generation so i kind of early web pages were essentially handwritten HTML OK

1851
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:22,280
handcrafted we've moved on to things being generated but the page is largely are intended

1852
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:23,890
for human consumption

1853
01:52:23,910 --> 01:52:27,360
it is that these pages to be looked at and to be read rather than

1854
01:52:27,390 --> 01:52:32,700
targeted at a machine processing so what kind of moving towards this is more

1855
01:52:33,030 --> 01:52:37,620
making no web sources accessible to to automated processes

1856
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:41,130
and the problem OK again this should hopefully be kind of fairly obvious is that

1857
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:45,180
a typical web pages have rendering information about markup and so on

1858
01:52:45,190 --> 01:52:49,690
the content of this page is is accessible to me OK i can read this

1859
01:52:49,690 --> 01:52:52,310
page and i know that it's about the w three c

1860
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:57,440
but the kind of the underlying content is not really particularly accessible to computers OK

1861
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:00,940
if we're going to going to do this we made across natural language understanding and

1862
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:04,470
so on which fabio against me talk a little bit later on

1863
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:06,590
but essentially this this

1864
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:11,310
information here is targeted at me is that as a person

1865
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:15,790
so the idea is that is to move towards the semantic web we can provide

1866
01:53:15,810 --> 01:53:20,470
resources which are more amenable to machine processing and do this by some some markup

1867
01:53:20,470 --> 01:53:26,180
or some additional information describing the content and function of these particular resources

1868
01:53:26,190 --> 01:53:30,280
and this is where the notion of the ontology comes in to provide some vocabulary

1869
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:35,460
for the annotations and the and the the the the ontologies to ensures that we

1870
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:39,460
have some kind of standard language that we're all talking so the annotations that we

1871
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:42,310
make we can understand and we can share

1872
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:45,150
OK and the kind of prerequisite for this kind of approach is that we have

1873
01:53:45,150 --> 01:53:49,720
some standardized language to do this representation so we have to have a common syntax

1874
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:55,630
is that we can agree to share this same the semantic web passing around

1875
01:53:57,250 --> 01:53:58,990
in order to do this

1876
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:05,160
OK we have notions of metadata so we're mucking up our resources or describing resources

1877
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:08,810
with descriptions of their content that's all very well

1878
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:12,220
but it's no good unless everyone speaking the same language OK so we have to

1879
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:17,690
ensure that kind of speaking the same language terminologies can help us to do this

1880
01:54:17,710 --> 01:54:21,470
terminologies controlled vocabularies and so on so they can kind of limit the the language

1881
01:54:21,470 --> 01:54:23,410
that we use to describe things

1882
01:54:24,150 --> 01:54:26,960
provide some shared common vocabulary

1883
01:54:28,370 --> 01:54:32,340
even sharing a terminology isn't sufficient OK because we can we can now use the

1884
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:35,600
same terms we could use the same language but we could actually have different underlying

1885
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:41,090
interpretations of those terms because maybe terms that have have different meanings in different contexts

1886
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:43,920
so the idea that the ontology is that we move on from the kind of

1887
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:49,220
just just sharing the terms and actually have some explicit representation of the

1888
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:52,820
the kind of understanding of the meaning of those terms and this again will help

1889
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:58,160
us in sharing interoperating and moving information around

1890
01:54:59,410 --> 01:55:02,800
the activities that we need to go through in order to build a semantic web

1891
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:07,410
including things like annotation is we need to associate metadata with our resources

1892
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:11,240
we need to integrate things so james talking very much but it's all kind of

1893
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:12,910
white notion that the

1894
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:16,740
semantic web is distributed the information from many different places that we need to bring

1895
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:22,720
and then we might perform some inference over information about when i say inference i

1896
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:24,340
just mean kind of fairly general

1897
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:28,720
machine processing to try and kind of either understand or gets more out of the

1898
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:31,030
to the the information that we have

1899
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:34,730
so this this doesn't necessarily have to be heavy weight logic style inference can be

1900
01:55:34,730 --> 01:55:39,220
quite lightweight OK we could be using some kind of taxonomic reasoning for example just

1901
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:42,280
so the idea of inferences we just kind of captain the notion that once we

1902
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:45,790
pulled all this information and to get together we may need to do something with

1903
01:55:46,420 --> 01:55:51,590
and again the key goals here are to to try and interoperation and sharing information

1904
01:55:51,590 --> 01:55:56,150
so a lot of the work that we've seen in the kind of semantic web

1905
01:55:57,150 --> 01:56:01,700
has focused on the definition of a collection or stack of languages so there's a

1906
01:56:01,700 --> 01:56:04,410
kind of on this slide here on

1907
01:56:04,730 --> 01:56:08,930
the aside on the left hand side there's this kind of idealised notion of the

1908
01:56:08,930 --> 01:56:12,960
stack don't want to go into too many details of this this is just trying

1909
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:14,280
to show that there are

1910
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:18,020
a variety of languages some of which are all talk about what about the next

1911
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:19,680
half-hour so

1912
01:56:19,710 --> 01:56:24,030
they provide some basic machinery that we can use to kind of represent information and

1913
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:29,490
these then facilitate the notion of using annotation integration inferences we cannot move all of

1914
01:56:29,490 --> 01:56:29,960
this the

1915
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:34,650
the stack and i'll say a little bit clear about kind of RDF and RDF

1916
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:36,950
schema and so on

1917
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:41,890
so one general point

1918
01:56:41,950 --> 01:56:45,030
i think this this sort of relates back little to to one of the points

1919
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:47,350
that you made when he was talking about

1920
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:51,470
kind of kids building wars models and so on is a lot of the the

1921
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:55,350
representation languages have this kind of common approach to the use what one might call

1922
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:59,150
an object oriented model i don't we kind of object oriented in terms of an

1923
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:03,040
object oriented programming job and so on but the idea that

1924
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:06,530
we we can think of the world where we think about domain in terms of

1925
01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:10,380
things like objects or instances are individuals is an element of the domain are going

1926
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:14,350
to describe and then we can group together into classes or we may use the

1927
01:57:14,350 --> 01:57:19,020
word types of concepts and so on which are generally collections of sets of objects

1928
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:21,790
that share some common characteristics

1929
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:24,910
and then we have relationships of properties kind of

1930
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:29,410
sets of pairs of two of things the relationship between things

1931
01:57:29,470 --> 01:57:31,140
and in general

1932
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:35,330
this kind of language is we that when we when we approach to modeling using

1933
01:57:35,330 --> 01:57:38,920
this this kind of paradigm we can get languages which were kind of well understood

1934
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:42,660
we can formally specify them they're kind of relatively easy to use this there those

1935
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:44,320
a very dangerous turned to

1936
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:49,520
and using relatively easy to use subjective decision but they and their amenable to machine

1937
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:53,040
processing so we'll see that kind of language is i'm going to talk about adopt

1938
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:56,410
this kind of approach where we have objects are going to talk about we group
