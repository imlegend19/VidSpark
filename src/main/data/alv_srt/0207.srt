1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,570
at the time which happened to be his own program

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:12,270
this was essentially done by having observing experts play in doing supervised learning with regard

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,820
to the moves you then have

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,630
you know examples of good play really

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,990
and the other thing was that this that special became specific input features were used

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:27,400
so in what i had previously described the input features very very generic you didn't

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,930
have to know much about how to play the game in in order to create

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,190
this input representation now here that was different

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,420
so this suggests that we may also use in the TD approach special features that

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,290
are depend on our common knowledge and the other thing that we can do in

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,240
addition is to search

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,890
through a game tree

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,570
the government specific features in this case are

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,240
for example in which stage the game has become an

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,800
proceeds through different stages depending on what happens when for example is the running game

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,030
you if these two parties right

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,530
towards each other each is trying to reach the goal and of course there's a

18
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,170
clash happening but sometimes it happens or

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,290
almost always the and it happens that they overcome each other

20
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,150
and then

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,230
it's just running towards the goal this particular that that requires particular ways of moving

22
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:31,700
so that's very interesting information for an agent that plays backgammon in other situation is

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,910
the back game

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,040
suppose you during the game you fall behind because you throws are not so good

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,020
or the opponent hits you what you can now do is you keep your checkers

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,440
at the very back and wait

27
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,160
well you have you have to play of course but you leave these checkers there

28
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,950
and you know opponent runs towards you and i hope that these checkers will force

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,680
the opponent to be blocked some work and hit

30
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,580
at the same time you had built up a big block on your own side

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,450
of the board so that if the opponent is hit

32
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,560
to go to the bar used to enter and ends up behind this big block

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,120
thank you had created for that's another game type that require specific kinds of play

34
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,870
and that would also be very interesting in the future

35
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,020
other features of course just the people count how far is it from me to

36
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,310
go home with my stones there are other things like the cross over can't or

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:29,790
how many

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,850
how many throws it would take me until i can do bear of you can

39
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,720
count how many blocks blocks you have because the more blocks you have the greatest

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,560
danger of being hit and so on there's also the point that certain

41
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,370
certain points on the board of great strategic value and blocking them for you will

42
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,830
be very valuable so that could also be specific knowledge that enter and in fact

43
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,870
this has been injured and makes for even stronger play

44
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,620
another interesting thing of course search

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,330
it's an old idea generation and how he suggested how to approach computer chess by

46
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,140
having an evaluation function and combine that with search and the idea is that you're

47
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,180
evaluation function well in some ways be faulty you cannot have the perfect evaluation function

48
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,160
for complex games but if you search down the game tree then that can in

49
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,500
some ways to compensate for this problem

50
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,750
we just give you an example how such a game tree what's game tree looks

51
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:40,700
like so this is a given position and now one party can make different moves

52
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,350
in this case i just indicated too

53
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,720
and then from there on the other party can make a number of moves and

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,660
from there on the first part i can make moves again and

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,790
it's associated with each note

56
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,830
there's number here and the idea is that you pretty much enumerate

57
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:03,640
all the possible numbers on the possible states to certain death

58
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:10,470
and you evaluate them using your heuristic evaluation function and then you apply a minimax

59
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,700
search that means that

60
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,580
you try to find what is called the principle of variations

61
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,390
which emerges from maximizing in this layer minimizing in this layer maximizing this layer which

62
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,060
reflects that one of the players always wants to maximize

63
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,830
his score and the other player wants to minimize the opponent's goal

64
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,850
so that's the basic idea and this works fairly well in chess but in backgammon

65
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,560
of course you have additional complications and the complication is that you have facts

66
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,680
there are twenty one different dice combinations

67
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,290
for two days and suppose you start with given bought state and the first thing

68
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,240
is you have to roll the dice

69
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,980
this kind of unfolds already and then for the for the for the given discrimination

70
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,770
you have to make a move which can lead to different positions and now comes

71
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:14,160
the problem now in these positions again dice thrown which leads to further fanned out

72
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,970
so it's much harder to search deeply in backgammon because in between the dice always

73
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,580
give so many possible

74
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,520
possible variations

75
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,020
so effectively

76
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:33,000
search in backgammon is usually limited to three life because then the number of different

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,890
positions already grows quite a bit

78
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,620
is the kind of the career of TD gammon there were different versions with varying

79
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,680
number of of hidden units in the end there there were trained on one point

80
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:56,410
five million training games and it had quite an influence in the sense that professional

81
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,990
players after analyzing their games with a TD gammon actually changed the way of playing

82
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,850
is most noticeable in the in the opening for the starting positions always the same

83
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,660
and you can really just look at for the twenty one different combinations which moves

84
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,310
are being made and professional players actually took up quite a few suggestions from TD

85
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,620
gammon here and change the way of playing so nowadays

86
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,790
what we know

87
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,170
so it

88
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,080
they are

89
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:17,640
so it's

90
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,960
that year

91
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,560
you want

92
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:35,430
the way we see

93
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:05,340
feelings OK six

94
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,330
well the

95
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:33,420
so we may be

96
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,030
of course

97
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,950
he e

98
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,230
we can

99
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:28,060
well at least it need

100
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:09,730
and if you don't really

101
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:16,200
when he was done with very

102
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,910
one one

103
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,230
more you know

104
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,020
a special way

105
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,480
so what you're going to end up with this

106
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,640
let's go over the here sodium and chloride the keep attaching and detaching and attaching

107
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,620
but we've got two sizes modelling was hard spheres and so they're going to fit

108
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,110
together in a regular array

109
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,290
so this means that they will form

110
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,070
a crystal

111
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,240
so we're going to have solids and and we're going to have crystalline crystal crystal

112
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,560
and ordered solid

113
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,480
as opposed to the disordered solid will we'll talk about both a little bit

114
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:36,840
right so now i want to show you that this this comes necessarily from energetics

115
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,970
it's really it's a really cool derivation i want to compare two situations

116
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,600
here's an iron gas

117
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:55,460
this is my humble drawing to indicate the discrete sodium chlorine pairs

118
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,910
so this is one of these pairs that have shown up here it's got negative

119
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,290
we see that we get the negative energy by attaching the chloride to the sodium

120
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,800
and i'm saying suppose these four as they have to initially in the gas phase

121
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,230
and they remain two ions sees me two atoms per ion pair

122
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,570
discreetly bombing around the gas phase

123
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,020
so that's

124
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,980
situation number one situation number two is i take the same number

125
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,300
and i make

126
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:31,100
a role

127
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,380
they're all in one row

128
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,470
so what happens if this is

129
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,360
i've only drawn three but now let's

130
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,840
let's pump up the volume here let's get together

131
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,230
so i have ever get number of these things in a long line

132
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,790
you can that is going to be solid it's can be one-dimensional crystal

133
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,470
so the question is can i show you from an energetics standpoint that the crystal

134
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,310
is favoured over having the discrete set of

135
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,750
of pairs

136
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,660
and you know the answer is yes because i would set myself up for failure

137
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,780
to switch so let's let's take a look first of all situation number one when

138
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,110
you know how to do that because you know the energy of one pair so

139
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,020
let's just multiply that by a vigorous numbers so e

140
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,810
one will simply equal

141
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,380
and never get times

142
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,460
the energy of the ion pair

143
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,430
articles are not which we can

144
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,760
substitute whenever get role

145
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,710
i'm doing this for one one

146
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,920
plus one minus one like sodium chloride

147
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,380
we can come to make more complex later

148
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:39,060
and you have to get and from experimental evidence you can pull that of theory

149
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,540
so this is born exponent is determined experimentally

150
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,100
there are people that

151
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,330
all right so now let's get the energy for the line

152
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,120
so for that one

153
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,760
what to draw

154
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,260
line of the song to start with

155
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,770
get the color charges

156
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,000
doctor says is good for

157
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,940
right so here's the here's the

158
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,470
and the chloride on each side

159
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,270
and then we'll go for another

160
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,590
and then

161
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,280
another chloride

162
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,010
on each side

163
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,300
so now what i want to do is i want to start here at the

164
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,060
centre and i want to count the energetics

165
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,430
i what we do is i'm going say start with this science and of the

166
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:28,420
energy associated with the interactions between that i and everybody else in the role and

167
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,740
then multiplied by

168
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,310
ever get some is that the number of atoms are also the source for the

169
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,830
goose is sauce for the gander so what about edge effects i could ever get

170
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,080
number these things what do you think the air is going to be by failing

171
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,820
to recognise that at the end of six times ten to the twenty third i've

172
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,650
over counted some energy is vanishingly small

173
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,880
so no longer preoccupied by the end work were the big medal in the middle

174
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,680
is is everything here so

175
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,190
we can start this distance here is are not so i know the

176
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,520
the energy in this first

177
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,420
in the first pair

178
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,620
the energy in the first pair with equal

179
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,340
that's just gonna equal

180
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,990
where over four pi

181
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,000
that's one zero are not that's just

182
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,510
what we've seen before

183
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,990
but in addition

184
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:28,070
the field is continuing to radiate so it's unsaturated and it's omnidirectional so this canine

185
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,490
feels the repulsive force of the

186
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,070
cation over here

187
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,360
this can ionize is attracting the chloride next to it and it's repelling

188
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,080
the sodium

189
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:43,220
as the next nearest neighbour so that's repulsive term i got add up

190
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,300
i put that because that that's repulsive energy that's going to decrease the energy of

191
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,010
the system so i've got distance here two

192
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,640
are not

193
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:58,040
two are not an edit distance of two are not i have a positive repulsive

194
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,140
term i just plug into the

195
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,350
the coulombs law

196
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,080
and so that's going to be plus the square

197
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,830
over four pi epsilon zero

198
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,100
two are not

199
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,480
now what happens let's keep counting now the the the next one is the chloride

200
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:20,070
it's of opposite charge it exerts an influence only that's minus to plus so that's

201
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:24,060
going to give me this term here that's four pi epsilon zero

202
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,840
three are not

203
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,150
and so on and so i think you can see the way this is going

204
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,680
to her what about the born term forget the board turn important term is going

205
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,690
to be felt except in this first one so i'm going to forget now patch

206
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,960
the end

207
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,830
no only boring born repulsion to or not

208
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,240
that's always

209
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,410
all right and then we're going to do all going to do this i'm only

210
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,770
come in one direction so i gotta multiply this whole thing by two because i'm

211
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,280
come come both directions

212
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,730
so now i'm going to come back to this and again minus the squared over

213
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,690
four pi epsilon zero or not

214
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,590
times this series one minus half

215
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,920
plus the third

216
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,690
minus the quarter

217
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,020
its centre

218
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:18,160
so what we've got is this series is broken into two terms that are conveniently

219
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:23,460
representing two physical ideas this is electrostatics right here

220
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,850
the pre factor

221
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,070
embodies all the electrostatics

222
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,330
and what's all this stuff why is one half of thirty this is the instant

223
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:40,190
or the animals this is that is to say the instance adam arrangements

224
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,280
the instant adam range

225
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,300
in this case it's

226
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,900
now i do this is often just the that one central

227
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,980
canine so now let's do it for all the and so what we do now

228
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,110
is multiplied by an and then add

229
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,380
born repulsion

230
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,290
born repulsion

231
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,140
we put all that together here's what it looks like

232
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,610
it looks like this

233
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,790
equal to lines

234
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,370
and having natural

235
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,300
the square over four quite epsilon zero

236
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,650
are not one minus one over and i want to call this whole geometric factor

237
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,570
this whole geometric factor i'm going to put it into one

238
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,410
number and i'm going note that the madelon constant

239
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,300
the madelon constant

240
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,390
the madelon constant is simply the geometric factor that's enough

241
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,280
so let's put that here

242
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,220
with case

243
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,690
normally teach pointwise humanity

244
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,390
for to

245
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,440
and i don't and some schmoozing assumptions

246
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:12,070
assumptions on the rate of convergence of the bandwith parameter

247
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,690
we have

248
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,660
asymptotic normality following and at at the square root of n kind of scrambled of

249
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,240
n sigma in with the invention

250
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,580
with an asymptotic variance

251
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,640
which was approved before which is of the following form was defined peaks

252
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,220
and you can just model that it's exactly

253
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,370
mean world from zero

254
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:45,490
he it's of some functions that means in particular number that lambda is solution of

255
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,560
i differential equation and the initial condition is that lambda zero

256
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,990
equal to zero

257
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,280
you see clearly that

258
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,330
the mall

259
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,350
the closer i am

260
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:03,640
to the initial ponzi was you will so small business entity clients that's quite natural

261
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:10,970
because i would know even better the function and estimating and if i get

262
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:16,700
more and more far from this from this initial condition imposed in the problem i

263
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,760
have a bigger and bigger variance is entity variance

264
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,580
from my symptoms

265
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,890
here is

266
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,660
you are the main results

267
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,240
i can show you for the initial problems

268
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,290
well we had

269
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:41,370
lambda as the solution of differential equations depending on n and what was the conditional

270
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:48,560
expectation the next step is to change a little bit this is that instead of

271
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:55,290
assuming that and is exactly the conditional expectation i introduced some eighty in the random

272
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,850
x y and z

273
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,580
so n will be some solution of

274
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,890
another investor then which would be any implicit versus problems will have to take into

275
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,720
these people inverse problems

276
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,600
to derive some results from associated solutions for

277
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,540
so now i term to

278
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:34,830
the following relations and is far less

279
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,720
the result of in the best

280
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,470
i have again

281
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,540
differential equation also interested in the the solution of the differential equation nine first parameter

282
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,600
function lambda

283
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,950
but now the difference is that

284
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,720
i have the second

285
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,450
more than steady

286
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:06,260
is equal to n of ix y six and i don't have the identification condition

287
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,760
that the expectation of and even it's y is equal to zero

288
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,260
so i have to

289
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,450
introduce some

290
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,200
instrumental variable devoted to solve

291
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,720
this first problem

292
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,970
and then we place as the solution to the first problem to solve

293
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,140
nice and i differential equation so i have to

294
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,060
two c stands to inverse problems to solve

295
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,330
one is you one is linear

296
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,790
one is

297
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,430
involve some into was using some different show

298
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,310
OK great

299
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,080
one will be well posed and use would be

300
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,490
in schools

301
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,370
the idea

302
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:11,870
what i'm going to present you is how to solve

303
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,580
nonparametric this problem and then we use

304
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:20,120
and we call the results obtained by a threshold which i'm just going to include

305
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,990
all the articles on parameter estimates immigration

306
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,330
and then apply their estimator

307
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,700
in two

308
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,680
these first expansion a hand

309
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:38,390
for the estimated solution of the differential equation minus the so what happens now if

310
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,470
i may

311
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,260
by something more complicated

312
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:48,350
then the conditional expectation and the estimation of conditional expectation

313
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,180
and that's going to focus

314
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,180
the linear integral equations to solve

315
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,660
and we call the result

316
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:15,510
the hopefully know

317
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:20,370
compared to the initial problem i presented

318
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,450
this is

319
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:28,560
also an inverse and inverse problems i introduce some

320
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,790
instrumental variable the value such that

321
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:35,720
in expectation of excellent given w

322
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,540
is equal to zero

323
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,700
so the question i want to solve the following one

324
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,160
expectation of the minus end of x y given the equal to zero so i

325
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,100
can rewrite it more generally by

326
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,010
of these sequence are

327
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:57,180
he is an integral operator

328
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:04,430
and it has been shown that this inverse problem is ill posed it means that

329
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,260
you have to transform it to obtain a unique stable solution to your problem

330
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:14,450
and the transformation that was used

331
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,560
the article by the whole for us

332
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,890
the station used

333
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,830
this method

334
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,080
to regularize problem

335
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,870
and so

336
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,790
instead of solving

337
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:38,220
directly the problem and is quite two are i sort of know regularized made in

338
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
regularized down

339
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,290
introducing some

340
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,830
i isation of smoothing parameter i

341
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,830
so i have i five plus scottish

342
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,600
played in and i five equal to start and really been too far

343
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:00,790
the star is i dreamt of your favourite t it's also a conditional expectation

344
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,640
when i introduced some nonparametric

345
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,930
can estimators i have associated estimated

346
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,560
relation to solve

347
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,120
when we places

348
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:21,240
when placing your right TNT style by estimate cells and the conditional expectation

349
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:35,750
it's not

350
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,770
so this is

351
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,460
the worst case

352
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,620
it just

353
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,850
you can try

354
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,550
it is

355
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:33,820
and this is

356
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,330
it is

357
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:02,810
so that was the

358
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,820
one can

359
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,210
so the

360
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,850
because you want

361
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,990
one is

362
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,600
so what

363
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,540
or he

364
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,080
not so i've got a bit more

365
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,020
i don't like

366
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:56,730
so this is

367
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,660
after the about what is your

368
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,080
i see is that the

369
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,500
you know

370
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,810
this is shown here

371
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:56,900
it well

372
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,410
and the classification

373
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,570
since it is

374
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,990
based on this problem but

375
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,980
so some of

376
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:56,030
so we

377
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,210
so to say

378
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,690
english television and he is

379
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,680
in one of people

380
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,060
quite well

381
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:27,940
with all this

382
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:38,100
what i want to go to the first i was i would like to get

383
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,250
by the way

384
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,000
the question

385
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,020
how we understand what's in the image

386
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,230
i think

387
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:04,210
so what

388
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:13,120
well known

389
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:30,180
which they

390
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:37,250
o thing

391
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:51,500
what about

392
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:06,500
so much

393
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,060
the just but

394
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,790
and it's not like you

395
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:18,750
i'm not to understand what that means

396
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:25,160
the more which

397
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,750
now other

398
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,830
just before be true

399
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,290
i've known

400
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,640
all example

401
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,440
his like

402
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,660
but they

403
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,310
on ln

404
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:49,660
how old

405
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,440
raise your right

406
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:03,730
by the way

407
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,350
in one thousand

408
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:26,980
but now all

409
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:52,850
because y

410
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,560
because you

411
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,920
of course

412
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:05,660
right because it was and there

413
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:14,640
all but

414
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:26,730
the which was the course first that

415
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,540
the result in in

416
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,580
to do

417
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:41,290
except if you like

418
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,890
the problem which

419
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,420
in the born

420
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,190
the point

421
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,330
i want to go

422
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:13,020
of the

423
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,140
the town hall

424
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,140
i hope

425
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,790
and the right

426
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,440
this one

427
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,230
i'd like to was

428
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,370
all just

429
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,210
he played

430
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:01,210
o thing here

431
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,330
you know

432
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,710
and it was all

433
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,420
the school and the from

434
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,940
but the

435
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:39,290
able don't to understand what do you want to change

436
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:45,160
you see

437
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,460
it true

438
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,460
we're not going to the left

439
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,270
they somehow

440
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,560
which way are they gonna fall

441
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,440
so good

442
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,250
pretty good

443
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:13,130
so people it turns out are pretty good at at a bunch of these tasks are here we can say

444
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:18,440
suppose these some gray blocks are ten times heavier like these are stones some kind

445
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,730
of lightweight plastic and then we can show subjects the very same sets blocks but

446
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,940
coloring them differently you're gonna get a very different prediction if the gray ones are

447
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,580
heavy this one now hopefully you can see is pretty unstable whereas this one is

448
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,460
much more stable or here if you say which way is a gonna fall

449
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,250
if the gray ones are much heavier than the green ones then you can say

450
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,610
well it's in this case is gonna fall out way whereas in this case it's

451
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,480
more like that of all the way and it turns out again that people are

452
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,420
basically put quite accurate this

453
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:48,040
if we just add in these differences the model just adding the different the mass

454
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,290
differences again we get correlations are not perfect but you know around in the in

455
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,000
the mid mid-to-high point eight levels

456
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,480
and we can

457
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,670
we can just keep pushing the sort of thing like we can say right imagine you have this table

458
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,770
and we knocked the table so now we add an outside force

459
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:07,610
and we say is more likely to have read if i'm not stable hard enough

460
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,790
to knock some other block on the floor r is more likely to be red

461
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,360
or yellow blocks that fall so what do you think red yellow

462
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,360
red OK here

463
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,940
is an amazing how such that just a little subtle difference between these two

464
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,040
yes which is

465
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,340
most people switch from yellow here to read OK so how are you doing well

466
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,130
again idea are are thought is that you're running some kind of simulation you have

467
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,750
it's like this this is it's a snapshot from are simulator where you take the

468
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,270
tail and you bump and you see what happens there was a little bump here's

469
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:48,790
a bigger bomb

470
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,110
in this case basically the same result the yellow ones are the ones that get out of

471
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:57,380
and so we build a model which is just the very same physics model from before but now

472
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:02,900
it considers a range of different possible bump directions and magnitudes and again we don't

473
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:08,430
fit people's judgments perfectly but across arrive wide-ranging towers varying the number of positions different

474
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:08,920
kinds of blocks

475
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:13,880
pretty well captured most the variance with this model we can keep going i mean

476
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,100
i i don't want a boring with all this but the point is is just

477
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,000
like the turning test if you want to take the idea seriously that you have

478
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,670
this kind of abstract mental model like that you can run you want a show

479
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:24,380
that really there

480
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,000
you have to push it to some extent to show that it's really doing

481
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,790
enough work for you so it here i can show how well you can see

482
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:35,610
it we vary the size and shape of the object some of tall we put

483
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,020
these funny kind rails on different sides of the table

484
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,960
or we might q forces we might say in some cases i'm not gonna tell

485
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,860
you which way above the table you have to kind integrate out and other ones

486
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:48,830
i'd say was but from the side that's the that's and again the same thing

487
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:54,270
holds basically the this model for both the q and q forces for different size

488
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,320
and shape the blocks it's just this massive experiment here that's this all you can

489
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,420
get from that's is

490
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,920
you know across all these factors which we vary

491
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:05,340
it captures most of the variance it's interesting i think that it doesn't capture all

492
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,290
the very i mean sort of consistently imperfect right

493
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,710
i think that's telling us that's we are

494
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:15,630
we imperfectly capturing something real there's a real physics simulation engine engine in your head

495
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:19,040
that you can make these probabilistic inference about a we haven't got it exactly right

496
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,330
with the particular approximations that we're making

497
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,270
you can now if i'm sure at this point and probably about the time

498
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,710
just a just about on so i don't really have time to go into the

499
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,400
last bit the top which is gonna show you the same kind of thing about

500
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:34,790
how do

501
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:39,750
these probabilistic programs now for intuitive psychology but just just to give you a very

502
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:41,000
sort of quick

503
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,020
this basically these you know i think this is if anything can be more familiar to you

504
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,500
this audience because we're using

505
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,730
all the success in probabilistic planning a particular reusing pompey planning algorithms

506
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,840
and we're basically saying just like just like the there's this crazy idea that you're

507
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,880
into the physics might be based on a physics game engine in your head

508
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:05,170
here we suggesting that you have something like a ponte piece in your head and

509
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:09,380
you interpret other people's in another intentional agents whether the people a little blobs moving

510
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,330
as if they were

511
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:15,750
choosing actions by solving the pompey now i think can't appears is way too simple

512
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,480
but it but it's just that it's the kind of technology that you know i

513
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,830
think many people here familiar with

514
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:23,460
the basic idea is to say

515
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:28,710
ah i mean we are all just show you a couple of experiments just evocatively

516
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,060
so here we can we can see an age moving in a simple environment where

517
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,400
there are three possible goals and some constraints if you look down here you can

518
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:38,330
there you know various different

519
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:43,790
experiment different experimental conditions were remove the objects around already very whether there's a wall

520
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,560
and maybe there's a hole in the wall and the age and follows various paths

521
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:50,330
and at different points along the path we stop the movie and we say to

522
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,980
the subject what do you think this guy wants he was able see what is

523
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:54,730
he trying to get to

524
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,610
and as a function of all these different factors we can very people make judgments

525
00:45:58,610 --> 00:45:59,960
that you can see here on the second row

526
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,770
the the red blue and green are color-coded to the three objects and you know

527
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:06,520
if you if you if you take take a look at this paper in and

528
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,110
studied a little bit more detail if you if you're interested but you'll see

529
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,670
fairly intuitive variations in some first two things that can really tell whether it's air

530
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,020
be on our definition agency heads there are i thought it was in this case

531
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,830
i thought it was being and it seems like you switch today

532
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,480
are you can get all these very complex things like are and i think it's

533
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,040
probably not be the can't every now and then is it can be where i

534
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,250
think it be here but no definite now it's

535
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,420
and this model captures all those details

536
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,380
with an even higher correlation into the physics modeling here the correlation is in the

537
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,860
high point nines what is it doing well again like the physics simulator is very

538
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:44,980
it is

539
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,310
the site is one

540
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,480
well just

541
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:11,570
they showed

542
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,540
you say well

543
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:06,410
we've made

544
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:19,220
one side

545
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:34,730
the main

546
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:43,000
well one

547
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:48,810
and you see

548
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,090
right so

549
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:55,900
one of the few

550
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:06,860
one of the most cited

551
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:12,800
or is

552
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:19,980
or this would be the or

553
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,610
one the

554
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:37,700
and for that

555
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,900
one or

556
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:57,780
it is

557
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,680
which is this one which is the hard part of the computation because it takes

558
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,180
all the other agents into account when actually moving there is very easy optimally because

559
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:08,840
you just choose to this very simple rule which is moving to a new way

560
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,720
to that particular target and so the actual trajectories of x

561
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,760
on given in this way

562
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:22,450
and of course computing such expectation value you can do it either some mistakes what

563
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:29,070
you can here we compare some me field to control and we compute these expectation

564
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:32,800
always mean field always belief propagation and basically comparing it to

565
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,760
to the exact value get very very similar values is the cost difference and just

566
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,490
to see that this this problem is actually not trivial

567
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:44,050
we have compared it was agreed to control where each agent is the same well

568
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,340
going to be used in the fire and

569
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,590
forget about everybody else you see that that indicates that there is hardly any north

570
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:55,450
there's not such much about policy but if this is the system becomes noisy that

571
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:58,260
greedy policy is actually very bad

572
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,530
it uses some computation times as a function of the number of agents comparing to

573
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:06,800
exact his align exactly on the on log scale

574
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,110
and you see these these my slides of the computation time for this field so

575
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:13,380
you can efficiently inference

576
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:27,090
so the OK so the conductivity in this case

577
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:33,320
is are distances and j is is the desired number of a of agent at

578
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,360
that five j

579
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,450
and so

580
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:40,340
and this these are numbers that are given

581
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,300
and and and j this is the basically the number of

582
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,570
agents that end up at phi j if you if you have this vector y

583
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:52,640
recommended go down and so this becomes quadratic

584
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:56,510
in y so this gives a sort of the pairwise interaction in the graphical model

585
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,030
and then the

586
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:02,880
and then the this term which is the is is also coming into the graphical

587
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,340
model right because it is that this term is here

588
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,610
this is all in the ground is the a graphical model systems also in this

589
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,610
case this term is of course only linear

590
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,490
in any position

591
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:19,820
so it doesn't affect the graphical model structure

592
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:26,340
and clearly this success such a BP or mean field approach depends very much on

593
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,510
the density of such committed to

594
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:38,360
no it's a good thing but sorry if its point wise so it only it's

595
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,530
there's no term y alpha y beta

596
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,970
so it's it's a single

597
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,260
single note

598
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,090
so as single

599
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:50,010
single variable

600
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:58,660
there's no it doesn't compute it doesn't there's no link is just a single variable

601
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:04,360
now these these these variables are here restricted to

602
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:07,950
to a discrete set of n points so in this case

603
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:12,530
each while fuckin have the values minus two to two

604
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,070
no no no no

605
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:26,760
none of these so the average

606
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:32,070
so we have here so we have here is a probability distribution over y

607
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:38,550
we're where y is the vector for each each other agents and y alfie has

608
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:45,430
minus two to two in this case the the one-dimensional locations of the of the

609
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,130
the fire and so we have

610
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,970
and in that graphical model

611
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:52,510
which consist of two ingredients one is the

612
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:57,260
point wise terms that don't come from the from the free dynamics of each of

613
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:02,550
these pages and the other term come from the interaction that they should minimize something

614
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,300
jointly at the end time

615
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,930
these two ingredients are in this graphical model and that to do graph model inference

616
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:12,220
and in this particular simple example for instance is just as an example

617
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:18,070
you have to then compute for optimal control the expected value of y alpha and

618
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:23,000
is expected value you see that they a so here expected value for for green

619
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,070
is here

620
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,030
and maybe it's computers computed in the context of war all the others do

621
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,360
and then

622
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:40,260
still images

623
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,820
so here's another example here seem little bit more complex example where we have a

624
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,950
number of agents in two dimensional space

625
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:52,550
and where the dynamics of each of the agencies the second order

626
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:58,880
this is a second order system and we see you whether some

627
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:00,470
so we have

628
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,010
the position

629
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,880
the change in the position is given by the velocity

630
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:08,200
and the change in the village velocity is given by the control variable

631
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,990
and the sunlight

632
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:16,180
so we have some initial position forties for these cars that can so you can

633
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,840
think of this cars was mass and can steer

634
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,390
no they have so the and you get back to the end of the bridge

635
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,340
so now

636
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:31,510
if you want to optimize with easter and you can iteratively optimize that time instead

637
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:35,560
by updating at each iteration so essentially

638
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:38,570
you spent one one time magazine the spectator

639
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:42,680
and then you might expected to do with it that fix and those two problems

640
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,010
are simply

641
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:48,530
it by it with with twitter is closed form

642
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:51,820
and with that the w since you have done the l one norm and two

643
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:57,010
it's supposed to be easier

644
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,770
but all those do not use the financial sparse and i think this is nice

645
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:07,420
but i do prefer method that uses sparsity as we know see how we can

646
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:11,670
we can do that

647
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,990
so for that i will always he the square loss because it allows it is

648
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:20,600
a lot simpler two to present

649
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:24,700
so first something that we something we which should should never do

650
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:27,520
is to write that as a quadratic problem

651
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,920
OK so that one can be written

652
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,420
you can you can separate the positive part of the negative part and you get

653
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,850
a nice quiet and to be OK quieting down

654
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,610
we now you are constrained to this is all nice but this is if you

655
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:47,680
use in june nineteen well this would be very slow never never do

656
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,930
but for the square loss this that you might use and the main one and

657
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:53,690
it is that if you know

658
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:57,510
in advance assigned but one of the solution so if you know

659
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:01,060
which by about the positive which ones to be get even which one should be

660
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:07,780
then you know the solution to transform why because if you know which one should

661
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,720
be zero

662
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:16,280
so JBB was once they can be widely objective of this is the last will

663
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,030
be just a strict to in j

664
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:24,250
and you replace one known but just linear function

665
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,220
which depends on the on site

666
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:29,720
location is assigned can do that and of course this is a quadratic function which

667
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,020
you can optimize in closed form

668
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:35,190
it exactly is this simple equation

669
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,360
so if you give me a sign in advances and victorian advance then you can

670
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,150
simply get solution

671
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:45,000
so of course you have a lot of things that also features p defines and

672
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,030
that also this is not used in guess in some sense and they don't it

673
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,230
was you understand that i need to check

674
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:56,940
with the optimal not so hard to achieve the optimal amount

675
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:04,030
so this is just your candidate viktor candidates saying that the nonzero but which is

676
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,790
sometimes called the support of your solution

677
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,750
and he was outside victoria you know in advance is going to be of the

678
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:16,070
so now you have to check the two optimality conditions that i've described in earlier

679
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:17,340
on the tutorial

680
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:23,570
the first one the side of the bridge is actually actually is subject gravity one

681
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:29,290
condition and also that the the gradient with respect to the the inductive bible scholars

682
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,770
this is the two conditions to you need to check

683
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:38,480
and now you have two cottages for that they construct the sages iteratively so you

684
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,750
start from the all and keep adding

685
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,750
variables and you you can have that satisfy

686
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:48,550
and the good thing is that it only requires a small number of you know

687
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:51,110
assistant to to get wj

688
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:54,000
OK you need to invert to solve

689
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:56,610
it is the least square problem reduced to

690
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:02,630
viable which is efficient market

691
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:07,460
but the techniques in the technique i really like is homotopy methods for the square

692
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:12,610
loss so this has been invented multiple times in fact the first one to do

693
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:15,020
it was markovitz nineteen fifty six

694
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:19,110
then was born and then the last in two thousand four and the idea is

695
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:20,070
very simple

696
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:22,290
if that is to that is that if

697
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:27,400
is to get first goal is the sum of four months ago also somewhat ambitious

698
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,440
you want to get not one solution one and that all solutions for all possible

699
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,250
and and for that you just not is that if you know this and that

700
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,690
this is the solution

701
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:41,230
for a few problems

702
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,460
it is to find lambda

703
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:47,820
great it is valid as long as those two conditions are satisfied

704
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:53,480
and the sign condition is also so it's not constrained

705
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,000
this in good conditions

706
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,460
directional derivative condition is also

707
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,520
something which is nine and so at the end you get in dublin of london

708
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:09,530
four points and that you get an in of london which may be empty for

709
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:13,590
which the solution is optimal for that number

710
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:18,030
that the only means that you are you have the set of possible find function

711
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:21,210
for problem for agent of of and so

712
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:25,000
solution wj the function of lambda is piecewise

713
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:29,710
find so we are sleep on the road the possibility of running on unix solutions

714
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:34,090
so you can do with that but i want i want him to know what

715
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:39,450
complex than just using the semantic annotations which we expect normal users to do

716
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:41,860
there's this kind of information will be done by

717
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:50,050
some kind of administrator gonna whatever i don't expect non-technical people to

718
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:53,130
but they will be able to do it a lot of money to be doing

719
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:59,960
already but not without some dedication and willingness to invest the time to do it

720
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:05,000
we would like to give you lot of the main

721
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,760
are going

722
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:22,900
it is a

723
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:31,070
it is a fact

724
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:03,860
one of the big advantages patricia has in this case that has this problem topology

725
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:05,470
telling me this is

726
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:11,500
this happens five this property is limited to five times this properties inversefunctionalproperty on this

727
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,920
kind of information we don't have to scan information semantic media wiki it can be

728
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:21,240
here and then has small of this information and on the other hand as well

729
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:25,780
even the british is automatic interface builder

730
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:28,580
pretty hard to

731
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:31,410
get him to do such a nice interface on the fly

732
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:36,130
so again you would have to the pieces just have a list of all possible

733
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:41,030
values but since you have wiki where people can add new properties on the fly

734
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:43,160
new categories and fly

735
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,290
this won't scale anymore

736
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:50,200
if you try to give me all the properties that the possible for this instance

737
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,800
after a while if you have an open wiki this would become very long and

738
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,050
very unusable

739
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:03,710
yeah it is the problem it would be really nice so that and then you're

740
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:06,740
going to be used

741
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:10,420
one thing you to limit

742
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:18,740
this is

743
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,540
so we

744
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:27,430
the project should not be

745
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:31,930
is and

746
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,280
one of

747
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:57,700
so one more thing about this is we have to keep in mind the database

748
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,450
it's working on the same problems for

749
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:05,780
decades and they probably have much better solutions that we have investigated and no actually

750
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:06,570
would be

751
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:10,360
i think it would be very worthwhile just to look at what they did because

752
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,330
there already

753
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:16,570
but they if they are able to create a database for forms of the fly

754
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,880
out of the database schema and stuff like this so this is something that can

755
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,130
probably just three users that which just didn't have the time to look into it

756
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:23,540
too hard

757
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,910
but we must not forget that there is a lot of work out there already

758
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:30,800
in this direction

759
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:34,930
and actually this doesn't look much different than the computer database to system

760
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:36,910
if you look at it in the first cloned

761
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:38,970
the big advantage here is

762
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:41,030
you can change the schema

763
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:45,620
with in the wiki system you don't have to go in the back you don't

764
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:48,860
have to go into the database and you don't have to go into your code

765
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:54,030
it's completely flexible it can completely change with the community

766
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,780
sure you could also look the state of the system in the back country we

767
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:04,860
have database working it's my sequence in the end but this is what is different

768
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:08,530
from that kind of work and that's why we always to think how much of

769
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:11,630
the rest of the halftime can we actually use for use

770
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:16,300
for the user interface in this case i definitively agreed that we did not do

771
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,550
enough so we have to take a look at what they read it and see

772
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:26,300
how much can be reduced i think the semantic web community this whole

773
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,340
has more often than not the problem that it's not looking hard enough

774
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:34,050
it out of work that so some of the problems

775
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:39,080
but it's a personal opinion so don't confer please

776
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:53,300
one of the big advantages semantic mediawiki

777
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:57,760
is said it's an open source project many people are working on it and so

778
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,240
with the right light

779
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:05,350
we should have a one of the the same year but in the four

780
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:09,620
but this slide

781
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,100
so when which

782
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:14,580
one of the two

783
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,780
there really blew here

784
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,280
but you will

785
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,570
so i

786
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:21,700
left to right

787
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:25,330
well it looks like cancer

788
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:30,640
and of course they tried to

789
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:32,740
just another day

790
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:38,910
to make it most right

791
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:41,850
this is just like being

792
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:48,240
expression and we're actually going to

793
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:52,740
a lot of the difference

794
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:56,930
of the two right to know

795
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:01,050
my commiserations

796
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:05,350
six months

797
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:06,370
equal to

798
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:10,410
some of the ways and means use that means

799
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:14,930
how to write so we have only one component which

800
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:18,970
red green blue or

801
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:24,100
the yellow k in the second and

802
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:31,450
equal model

803
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:35,740
that means the column to the point that we have a great power

804
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,700
the big difference between maximum and minimum

805
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,080
the most away

806
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,310
the left it is left to right

807
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:47,680
and this that just allow it to you

808
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:48,430
the number of

809
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:53,660
which we have between the right and on the

810
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:55,910
the class

811
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:59,140
after applied research

812
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:06,200
bright line here

813
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:09,950
but this

814
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,810
how many features they the

815
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:20,620
and the

816
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,310
what you can do it all on it

817
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:30,120
the first lectures called just the most

818
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:36,990
even if it cause image and really you should be able to

819
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,890
has problem the truth because

820
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:45,160
there were several comp

821
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:52,450
one of the reasons why true

822
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:53,760
o which

823
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:55,310
right to

824
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:05,010
and statistical measures the color in the picture

825
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:07,600
just among

826
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:12,430
it's called the image so you have

827
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:13,600
it's the

828
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:18,850
could which goes on to some article on this one

829
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:20,330
and the three

830
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:25,470
you already them and the police among the pixels of the image

831
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:27,890
which have this problem

832
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:30,990
and i can compare to his

833
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:35,810
using a lot like the one

834
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:42,620
should be done

835
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,350
o with

836
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:48,890
the histogram and

837
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:51,160
because one the

838
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,640
following colors

839
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:59,300
that are so you might be able to make which small

840
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:01,700
it was proposed to use color

841
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,930
actually all about this article

842
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:12,470
but he was real estate is called to measure the contribution

843
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:15,990
so i can relate and even

844
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:19,310
every college

845
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:22,350
so the police

846
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:24,870
four and we have a do

847
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:28,990
the hue saturation and we can begin

848
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,470
we believe that the temperature

849
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:36,100
and we can pull a certain

850
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,280
and it was shown anyone

851
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:41,070
but of course want to

852
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:42,450
this effect

853
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,280
for example you

854
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:56,100
so is a particular case which can be represented by the nine members

855
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,080
i don't know

856
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:00,850
talking about color histogram what which how

857
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:04,350
we one color so how

858
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:06,950
left out of our models

859
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:08,800
because the

860
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,180
OK so

861
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:14,520
so the way we can approach the problem of training these models whether they are

862
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:20,030
kind of a single stage or multiple stage of systems through sort of sort of

863
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:21,490
an energy based view

864
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:22,530
so i

865
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,460
so let's imagine that model this kind of box that you feel it and inputs

866
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:31,820
and produces a single scalar outputs that we could call an energy called f OK

867
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:38,100
what would like to the we're going to train this machine that is regardless of

868
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:43,000
what is internal structure is going to try to produce low numbers for training examples

869
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,970
and anything that looks like training samples

870
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:48,100
and higher numbers for everything else and if you think about this kind of general

871
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:54,350
view it pretty much is described as you know probabilistic approaches to two learning like

872
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:00,570
you know maximum likelihood density estimation the likelihood like many people learning so many foreign

873
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:05,100
inconsistent sort of you know essentially identifying the manifold but energy to manifold and high

874
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:09,140
energy to everything else but it doesn't insist on the fact that the energy have

875
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:13,550
to take certain values which is what the probabilistic approach would would would say this

876
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:17,490
energy was apportioned says you i low energy for the training examples and for everything

877
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:20,770
else or for the region near the training samples everything else

878
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:27,220
let's imagine sort of a single one-dimensional situation where you have a single viable you

879
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:32,210
initially the energy is flat and the training examples are shown the bottom here and

880
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:34,500
what you want this kind of law energy for

881
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:40,190
whatever values for four around hyde the two regions and the density regions and what

882
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:42,720
you want to avoid this is flat energy

883
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:47,610
so you can do this by essentially feeding the energy function to a loss function

884
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:48,990
loss function is going to take

885
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,740
it's more like a functional is take the function

886
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:54,270
the energy function as an arguement is going try to shape it in the right

887
01:13:57,030 --> 01:14:00,750
and we can just use the energy itself is lost

888
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:07,250
the average energy of training samples is the lost because we might result in catastrophic

889
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:11,970
scenarios where the energy surface become low and flat everywhere so the loss function

890
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:14,690
what we get in the way we're going to build the loss function in most

891
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:18,980
of the models that people use in deep learning way supervised learning for that matter

892
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:23,140
of that type you take a loss function that is a decreasing function

893
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:28,010
of of the energy on the training samples an increasing function of the energy of

894
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:31,090
all the samples it somehow dream up

895
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:34,830
and the idea is that you're going to

896
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,640
take a training sample

897
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:40,860
and pushed down on the energy by changing the parameters of the surface you pushed

898
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:44,210
down the on the energy of those samples

899
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,790
OK so most by those those are the

900
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,460
and then you can to generate some of the tree of the sample

901
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:52,680
known training example something else

902
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:55,180
i push OK

903
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,770
so because you push down on the training sample you put up on everything else

904
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:03,420
you know the surface going take the right shape and that's the basic idea behind

905
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:06,550
which it was machine and other other models of this type

906
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:13,330
so you can always turn there the energy models into probabilistic models by basically taking

907
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:16,990
into the minds of the of the energy and normalising

908
01:15:17,670 --> 01:15:22,300
so if you really insist on computing probabilities you can take the energy function you

909
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:27,700
could even include additional slides and do e to the minus some positive constant normalizing

910
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:31,520
you probability but there are situations where you might not be able to do this

911
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,430
because is too complicated and you can compute the denominator so in fact lot of

912
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:38,330
the techniques have to do with how to not compute dominator

913
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:41,180
but if you have model like this you could do a lot of things you

914
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:46,730
could do an image denoising you basically model the data by training model like this

915
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:49,120
so the probabilistic view

916
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:54,370
you basically want to make the numerator big on the training samples and the denominator

917
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:57,740
which is going to average measure everything small

918
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,590
and the problem is you can compute this piece

919
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:06,520
because it's it's it's the sum over all possible configurations of the y variable and

920
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,980
why might be high dimensional bible you can compute this integral this is a very

921
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:12,400
simple form and most cases it doesn't

922
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:18,380
so what so if you want to compute the derivative of this suspected the parameters

923
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:21,370
minister w symbolizes the parameters

924
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:25,840
the ricci looks something like this has got the energy of the training sample

925
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:29,820
minus the is actually the average of the energy over the of

926
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:35,800
the average of the gradient the energy where the average is taken over the distribution

927
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,690
of the model gives to each other samples

928
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:41,300
OK and you can compute the city so replace it by something which is why

929
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,670
RBN's two

930
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:47,550
or use other tricks are going to talk about the tricks

931
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:54,070
so so here is here's another trick

932
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:56,650
the trick is going to build this model

933
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:01,300
with the special structure and almost all of the deep learning models use that structure

934
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,430
and internally

935
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:06,740
the structure is that we're going to build the model so that it has hidden

936
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:10,880
valuables e which we call the code that we use this as the feature

937
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:12,900
that's all model extracts

938
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:17,200
OK so the model is going to have to use this invaluable that's going of

939
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:21,590
an argument to the to the energy if you will

940
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:24,170
and that's going to be your code

941
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:26,920
and the way most models are built

942
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:31,170
it is true reconstruction so all you the autoencoder RBN's are actually the same nature

943
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:35,050
so taken inputs you run into some sort of encoder you get code the neuron

944
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:41,510
through decoder and then you compare the decoded code or the result of passing for

945
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:43,920
the chain with the original inputs

946
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:47,700
compare that that's your energy

947
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:52,690
right so the model has to use the code to reconstruct and so we use

948
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,810
the reconstruction error as the as the energy what you want to do if you

949
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:59,290
think about it you would give low energy to the training examples high energy to

950
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:03,010
everything else what that means is that you want your model to properly reconstruct the

951
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:07,630
training examples you wanted to explicitly not reconstruct anything else OK

952
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:09,990
so what you train two not reconstruct

953
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:13,910
anything else but the training samples of things around them

954
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:16,170
it's kind of weird thing that you want to try to

955
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:17,510
there's something wrong

956
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:21,790
and if you think about it if you try to reconstruct everything you get trivial

957
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:28,360
because this would become the identity function it will be constructed absolutely everything perfectly and

958
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:32,380
your energy surface is completely flat because you has your reconstruction are everywhere that's not

959
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:33,230
a good model

960
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:39,240
because of some and you get

961
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:41,090
the same thing

962
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:42,820
many of

963
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:46,360
something else it doesn't matter actually if it's a valid input on usually people twenty

964
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:47,870
three cost to produce

965
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:51,420
valid input when you give it a non the or corrupted input gets the idea

966
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:54,860
of using the algorithm based on the models of this type

967
01:18:54,870 --> 01:19:01,050
OK so this is the basic and critical to model that a lot of us

968
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:02,380
have been using

969
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:05,990
which you can stack and then you get rid of the decoder and you can

970
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:09,610
use them is going to feed forward

971
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,590
feature extractor

972
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:15,290
but here is going to be more slightly more general view of this encoder decoder

973
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:20,190
model where easy as a latent variable really now sells is not just value to

974
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:23,920
compute with younger but it's the kind of latent variable you have to do inference

975
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:29,100
over OK so general model you take actually run into an encoder

976
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:35,670
for machine and the service level certainly they are different than concepts are quite different

977
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:41,080
too difficult to visualize then we deal with high dimensionality which means that all statistical

978
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,770
techniques might problems and so on

979
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:49,430
and also we deal with very high number of

980
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:53,470
hundreds of thousands so it's not so unusual

981
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:58,710
so all these properties make the whole problem quite difficult on the other side

982
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,910
text has one feature which is very

983
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:07,920
pleasant are friendly for analytic methods and this is the fact that the data is

984
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:17,440
highly redundant and basically all practically all methods count on this single property which makes

985
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:21,950
the easy for everybody too

986
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:27,370
with very simple idea also text and most likely everybody will get some kind of

987
01:20:27,370 --> 01:20:31,890
results and so basically very simple recipe for

988
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:37,090
kind of ad-hoc text mining methods would be just take out some phrases out of

989
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:42,990
the text find some kind of related words and create some kind of summary out

990
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:45,600
of it is most likely will work

991
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:51,040
and a lot of text mining papers with what was followed this recipe

992
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:58,170
now let's put the text mining can the context so who

993
01:20:58,190 --> 01:21:00,970
in this scientific area actually works

994
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:03,750
in the text analysis arena

995
01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:05,200
so on one side

996
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:12,040
it's a machine learning context mining so this would be this community of this KDD

997
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:18,510
conference and maybe ICML ECML conferences for machine learning apart when you decide to have

998
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:23,950
this natural language processing so that this would be linguists these conferences like a COI

999
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:28,700
and so on so they're more interested in linguistic aspects of text

1000
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:35,270
then in the last decade very popular fields information through so

1001
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:43,480
this area is more less concerned with search and related problems and recently so semantic

1002
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:50,280
web and even more recently that two point o which actually also deal with text

1003
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,010
quite a lot

1004
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:54,760
although they also other problems as well

1005
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:57,730
so this is roughly the

1006
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:02,580
the landscape of the area or communities which deal with text

1007
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:10,470
and what's interesting some of these communities have almost no overlap to be honest especially

1008
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:17,710
the semantic web and machine learning overlap is almost zero well with this other fields

1009
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:20,110
there's a little bit more

1010
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:29,080
so this would be the typical tasks each of these committees and so that analysis

1011
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:38,790
conditioning greece takes reason knowledge representation and reasoning and search and databases for information through

1012
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,960
so if you take text analytics

1013
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:45,170
and try to

1014
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:48,970
the main

1015
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:56,020
areas of work are the most relevant concepts with which we are dealing with when

1016
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:59,870
dealing with text so we can say that first we need to be

1017
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:05,700
a pair of what kind of representations we use for representing text

1018
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,340
so this would

1019
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:13,210
this would range from character level representation is very simple once a month and then

1020
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:17,390
on the other side to first order theories on the next slides we'll go through

1021
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:19,470
all these levels

1022
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,140
next techniques

1023
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,740
how how we deal with

1024
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:27,920
with text so one side we have many work still a lot of men are

1025
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:34,730
actually being done in the text of the learning be sort of the intermediate step

1026
01:23:34,730 --> 01:23:38,850
in the most difficult one will be reasoning quit text or with the content which

1027
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:44,800
which we extract from that and the tasks so this would be the actual algorithms

1028
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:51,310
are applications the and beach which we have so this would be search very popular

1029
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:58,620
task then all kinds of learning unsupervised semi supervised unsupervised learning musicians summers the through

1030
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:02,170
machine translation and so on

1031
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:08,150
in the second part of text mining part will be the

1032
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:12,010
so what's interesting is that these three

1033
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:16,070
main group groups of concepts

1034
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:23,170
i used for dealing with text somehow they all contribute or they all share ideas

1035
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:28,200
intuitions methods even the data datasets and so on you know this

1036
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:34,450
a kind of that with with these ideas although as i said so they often

1037
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:38,670
they just don't communicate or some people are to be and

1038
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:45,830
don't share ideas on the social level but technically they they are quite similar

1039
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:48,630
in way

1040
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:54,900
we can say that up here is politics and some of his scientific work

1041
01:24:56,610 --> 01:25:01,560
may be interesting to mention so this in the an initiative by

1042
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:04,600
mainly by

1043
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:07,200
w three c people

1044
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:15,270
somehow to establish the so-called web science and this is the architecture of this website

1045
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,800
so you can see the details here and this

1046
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:20,520
site so

1047
01:25:20,690 --> 01:25:25,710
usually that's our community KDD community would appear somewhere here in a i

1048
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:33,360
and computer science but everything else is around this from media law economics on one

1049
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,120
side and the other mathematics psychology and

1050
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:43,600
so all these contextual sciences which provide the context for websites

1051
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,480
and this is relatively new so

1052
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:49,010
that's why i cannot say much more on this

1053
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:52,880
will discuss

1054
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:56,340
do we represent text

1055
01:25:56,570 --> 01:25:58,850
we have

1056
01:25:58,900 --> 01:25:59,710
at least

1057
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:02,820
three levels of representation

1058
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:09,370
so i will discuss each of each of them a little bit more in detail

1059
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:11,320
but let's just let's

1060
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:13,640
make sure quick walkover

1061
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:14,980
now when you look

1062
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:18,010
through an optical telescope from the ground

1063
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:20,640
and you look at the system

1064
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,080
you will see the light from the donor

1065
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:27,010
because there's very little light coming from the neutron star because there's an enormous miss

1066
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:30,540
small surface most of the energy comes out in x-rays anyhow

1067
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:37,040
so we only see the light from the donor

1068
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:41,940
i have learned over the years this has nothing to do with doppler shift

1069
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:45,250
but when you look at the spectrum of the star

1070
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:47,100
they in general can tell

1071
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:48,760
how massive stars

1072
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:49,900
in other words

1073
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:53,590
a star which is ten times more massive than our sun has a very different

1074
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:55,950
spect and the spectrum from the sun

1075
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,800
and so

1076
01:26:56,810 --> 01:27:00,750
they look at the spectrum and they say this is probably five times more massive

1077
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:04,970
than the sun but this is probably twenty times more massive than the sun

1078
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:09,240
so astronomers can tell by simply looking at the spectrum

1079
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:12,640
of the donor what the mass of the donor

1080
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,900
so let's call this star number one

1081
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:15,930
so they look

1082
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:19,850
starring optical light from the ground and they say

1083
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:22,940
we know roughly in one

1084
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:26,410
now they see the doppler shift of this one

1085
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:29,220
so they see an absorption line in the spectrum

1086
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:31,220
goes nicely back and forth

1087
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:32,920
and they say i

1088
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:33,970
we now know

1089
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:35,710
the orbital period

1090
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,000
and we know

1091
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:38,920
the velocity v one

1092
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,220
and we know the radius r one

1093
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:45,580
we know all that

1094
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:48,030
but of course astronomers no

1095
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:50,680
i hope

1096
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,300
they also know

1097
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,980
whereas companies law

1098
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:55,580
i didn't erase anything

1099
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:59,250
but i did

1100
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:03,290
they also know capital

1101
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,510
now look at capital law

1102
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,220
so you know i one

1103
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:08,750
you know and one

1104
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:09,920
you know t

1105
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,070
but what you don't know is are two what you would like to know

1106
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:16,920
that is the mass that's the radius of the orbit of the creator

1107
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,340
you don't know this one

1108
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:22,570
and you don't know that one

1109
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:23,820
but you know

1110
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:24,990
n one

1111
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:26,030
times i one

1112
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:28,030
it is and two times are two

1113
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:30,110
so you have two equations with two unknowns

1114
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:31,650
you can solve for n two

1115
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:33,840
you can so far too

1116
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:36,210
so now you will find the mass

1117
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:37,210
of the

1118
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:43,050
immensely powerful

1119
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:47,260
so this has been the game which has been going on for many years whereby

1120
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:48,690
actually astronomers

1121
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:49,780
this is what

1122
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:52,170
my specialty has been for the past

1123
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:56,420
i can't even remember since nineteen sixty six for the past decades

1124
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:00,760
so in x-ray astronomy we've made a living out of trying to determine the mass

1125
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:03,170
of these creatures

1126
01:29:03,190 --> 01:29:05,090
and in many cases

1127
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:09,090
do you find that the mass of the creator is very close to one point

1128
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:11,650
for solar mass

1129
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:13,550
we are sure that in that case

1130
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:16,940
we're dealing with a neutron star

1131
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:20,010
it's not an accident that we find one point four times the mass of the

1132
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:24,920
john as the car

1133
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,960
the quantum mechanical calculations

1134
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:31,210
in nineteen thirty

1135
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:34,460
and if you take a white dwarf

1136
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:37,880
and you don't matter onto the white dwarf

1137
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:41,420
and it reaches a mass of one point four solar masses at the white dwarf

1138
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:43,340
can no longer support itself

1139
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:45,210
the collapses

1140
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:47,150
so that's the upper limit of the

1141
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:48,530
white dwarf

1142
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:53,210
that's called the child caliente mitigate got for that nobel prize in nineteen eighty three

1143
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:56,990
wide by the way all the all by itself is the bizarre stories about the

1144
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:58,670
radius of the earth

1145
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:00,530
ten thousand kilometres

1146
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:01,940
and it has about the mass

1147
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,400
one of the

1148
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:07,650
they already we it stars all by themselves

1149
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:12,380
we demonstrated that the upper limit on the mass of of the white dwarf is

1150
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:18,440
one point four solar masses so we were not surprised that many of these creatures

1151
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:23,130
headmaster one point four solar masses not was they probably worldwide what in the past

1152
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:27,760
and they were pushed over the chandrasekhar limit

1153
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,550
later in time can general relativity

1154
01:30:30,610 --> 01:30:33,730
einstein's theory of general relativity

1155
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:38,510
out of that theory it follows that if you keep dumping mass onto the neutron

1156
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:43,340
the moment that you crossed the three solar masses line

1157
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:46,110
the neutron star can no longer support itself

1158
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:49,490
and collapses into a black hole

1159
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,030
now comes the question

1160
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:54,210
is a black hole

1161
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:56,940
a black hole is an object

1162
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,550
from which

1163
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:01,070
light cannot escape

1164
01:31:01,090 --> 01:31:02,820
i have to something

1165
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:07,400
and i think i'm going to raise the left part of the blackboard

1166
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,050
it is an object from which

1167
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:12,400
light cannot escape

1168
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:18,940
i have to be more specific than that

1169
01:31:20,150 --> 01:31:24,550
black hole is an object from which the escape velocity is larger than the speed

1170
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:28,420
of light

1171
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:31,480
we know what the escape velocity is

1172
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:35,260
because this remember and that's why i pay attention to it and mentioned is also

1173
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:37,300
the escape velocity

1174
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:39,860
so here is the black hole

1175
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:41,110
there is a

1176
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:46,670
radius around the black hole which has name wonderful name is called the event horizon

1177
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:54,980
and all i have to do is make this e

1178
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:57,800
and i can calculate what the rate is is

1179
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:00,690
that means if you the inside that radius

1180
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:02,360
then the escape velocity

1181
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:03,820
will be larger than c

1182
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,880
you can get up

1183
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:08,670
so the radius of a black hole

1184
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:12,300
is then the the radius of the event horizon i wouldn't want to call it

1185
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:15,650
the radius of the black hole but the radius of the event horizon

1186
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:19,630
it is that two mg

1187
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:24,460
divided by c squared

1188
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:26,710
if you are

1189
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,960
closer to the black hole

1190
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:33,750
in this case velocity would be larger than c which is not possible

1191
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,920
to give you a little bit of feeling for what this means

1192
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:39,400
if you take your

1193
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:43,320
and you take the mass of the earth which you can look up in new

1194
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,690
you substitute that in there

1195
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:50,570
you will find that the radius of the earth to become a black hole is

1196
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:53,090
only one centimetre

1197
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:56,050
so you you the mass of the earth

1198
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:58,740
and we want some sense of consistency

1199
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,650
so that if a rule if the conclusion can be reasoned in several ways for

1200
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:05,490
example that each way should be for the same answer

1201
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:10,920
it doesn't matter which order you apply the operations in you still get the same answer

1202
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:16,820
and the robot is not allowed to just arbitrarily ignor

1203
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:18,790
relevant information

1204
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:23,860
an equivalent states of knowledge have to be represented with equivalent plausibility statements

1205
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:25,770
then it turns out

1206
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:29,870
these belief functions must satisfy the rules of probability theory

1207
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:33,920
and the sum rule the product rule and bayes rule that follows

1208
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:38,290
so here's a kind interesting sideways approach to

1209
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:39,800
arriving at

1210
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:42,820
probability theory

1211
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:48,060
it's a language for representing beliefs rational agents

1212
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:51,940
it extends logic

1213
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,130
strengths and beliefs

1214
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:56,030
questions rather

1215
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:02,820
so here's a different way of approaching

1216
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,820
the problem that motivates probability theory

1217
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:10,860
this is kinda gambling or economics approach

1218
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:14,140
it comes in the form of the dutch book theorem

1219
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,750
which i think is definitely the talk about

1220
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,410
two so one of the founders bayesian statistics

1221
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:26,250
so willing to accept bets

1222
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:29,910
with odds proportional to the strength of your beliefs so now

1223
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:34,810
the way we can assess the strength of your beliefs beliefs is that we're gonna make you gamble

1224
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:36,480
thank you

1225
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:36,790
you know

1226
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:38,250
is it

1227
01:34:38,730 --> 01:34:41,160
but is it real madrid and barcelona playing tonight

1228
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:46,850
thank you

1229
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,140
right next week

1230
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:52,790
so you could have beliefs about what you think is gonna win right

1231
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:58,270
might be willing to bet

1232
01:34:58,830 --> 01:35:01,370
on the basis of those beliefs so you believe that

1233
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:02,940
rallies gonna win

1234
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:08,410
with strength billy point nine without means is that you'd be willing to accept

1235
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,810
nine to one odds

1236
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:12,120
are better

1237
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,090
here is the interesting

1238
01:35:18,490 --> 01:35:18,910
in fact

1239
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:24,250
if you have a set of different beliefs not one belief but set of different beliefs

1240
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:33,920
unless these different beliefs are coherent with each other in that they satisfy the rules of probability theory

1241
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,470
okay the most trivial one would be

1242
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:38,480
my belief in x

1243
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:40,610
and my belief and not acts

1244
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:42,060
should sum to one

1245
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:43,250
for example

1246
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:45,540
but things along those lines

1247
01:35:48,430 --> 01:35:51,170
unless your beliefs satisfy the rules of probability theory

1248
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:55,270
there exist some set of simultaneous bets called a dutch book

1249
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,590
which you are willing to accept

1250
01:35:58,470 --> 01:36:02,060
for which you are guaranteed to lose money no matter what the outcome

1251
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,310
this isn't about losing money on average

1252
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:09,030
this is about

1253
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,190
sure loss

1254
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:14,320
and the only way to guard from that's fourier believed to

1255
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:16,750
because here with the rules a probability theory

1256
01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:23,520
so this is kinda economics or r yet

1257
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:30,980
by confidence values are ranges

1258
01:36:36,370 --> 01:36:37,490
in this setting

1259
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:39,930
in the sense that

1260
01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:41,350
you know

1261
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:42,250
if u

1262
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,590
if u have a range

1263
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:47,890
over something like between point seven and point eight

1264
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:53,070
there's no clear way a betting on their

1265
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:55,600
in this framework

1266
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:00,580
so you need to basically the

1267
01:37:02,910 --> 01:37:03,600
need to commit

1268
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:07,620
and actually in a betting scenario it's much more

1269
01:37:09,910 --> 01:37:14,430
intuitive is to exert to figure out what somebody's beliefs are okay

1270
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:18,400
you know that if you ask them what do what are your beliefs they might

1271
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,200
not know and then you say okay i'll give you

1272
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:26,120
you know ten to one odds and also known you say ninety one eight a one whatever

1273
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:28,980
and then at some point they're willing to accept bet

1274
01:37:31,710 --> 01:37:36,980
that's one way of figuring out what the person's you know beliefs are but of course

1275
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:39,330
has a model of humans is quite

1276
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:42,750
flawed because humans are not coherent

1277
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:44,540
for example you know

1278
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:49,040
little lotteries would never work if humans were totally coherent right

1279
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:51,810
maybe i don't know

1280
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:56,460
in general humans are not very coherence

1281
01:37:57,790 --> 01:38:00,750
so it's not necessarily it's a model of what humans should be

1282
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,080
we want robots underwater robots we humans

1283
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:06,210
well robots three rational

1284
01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:09,980
there should be more rational than humans

1285
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:17,790
so this is just a model the economic rationality which is a bit idealise of course

1286
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:19,920
just want

1287
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:24,920
these are

1288
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:32,500
well you could affect your belief in

1289
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:36,440
that's true

1290
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:40,330
poured into dictionary you got bytes of text

1291
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:42,660
so how to solve this problem

1292
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,520
if you using

1293
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:47,520
another library

1294
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:51,600
i'm not just once class library that using this approach

1295
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:56,350
what they can do it can put not real elements in your crash

1296
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:59,270
table you can do partially

1297
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:05,180
this is you put simply point to the element and this element is least

1298
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:07,980
and if you adding additional rewards for example

1299
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:13,500
khatami has the same hash functions simply put them into a really

1300
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:17,580
the disadvantage is that you are doing

1301
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:23,580
using least it's again not local usually because you like it this element and and

1302
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:26,870
again you have additional point

1303
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:31,390
it's more

1304
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,160
good structure

1305
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:35,540
this is not a good here

1306
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:37,890
another approach what you can do

1307
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:40,680
and it's very good for modern hardware

1308
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:42,500
he is to do to pass

1309
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:45,790
what simply a linear expression

1310
01:39:45,790 --> 01:39:47,120
for example

1311
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:51,390
we are going to index our documents and what we are doing

1312
01:39:51,410 --> 01:39:55,540
we are creating partial forward in one document

1313
01:39:56,350 --> 01:39:59,270
and what we've done with these document

1314
01:40:00,710 --> 01:40:04,020
results from this has to out the dictionary

1315
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:06,270
and the intuition behind these

1316
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:07,910
in that

1317
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:11,200
dictionary from one document spread to small

1318
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:15,520
and we can use cash for it which is very far in addition

1319
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:21,350
and when we finished with a document and are this dictionary not a small dictionary

1320
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:26,710
to the while using dry or another structure but because it was

1321
01:40:27,790 --> 01:40:30,100
repeating document many times

1322
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:34,560
you don't need to all appearances of this for you

1323
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:37,640
you need to put on the repeating documents

1324
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:39,160
and for this small

1325
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:43,000
only for these documents what we can do

1326
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:48,060
we are trying to edit my and we see that this element is already occupied

1327
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:50,120
by cat

1328
01:40:51,210 --> 01:40:56,330
we start trying all elements all next elements in disarray

1329
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:57,390
and when we

1330
01:40:58,310 --> 01:41:01,000
if we come to the last element we can

1331
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:04,040
you can jump to the first one

1332
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:06,500
and this is catches refresh

1333
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:12,480
and if you indexing it's my approach how are used implement it to increase in

1334
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:18,040
distance speed i'm using is usually an indication station has two dictionaries

1335
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:24,210
one small index in small is has for this particular document

1336
01:41:24,230 --> 01:41:26,560
and this is the first place to use linear

1337
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:28,770
passion because it's perfect for

1338
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:31,500
morning process standard fast

1339
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:35,500
and then when i'm done with a document or usually a group of documents i

1340
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:39,040
merge this this has to be a good dictionary

1341
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:43,160
and for big addition i can use whatever everyone structure i'm not

1342
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,790
i don't bother about

1343
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:49,980
the speed of light into this structure because i don't do a lot of there

1344
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:53,980
are added i remove all repetition of words from the action

1345
01:41:54,850 --> 01:41:59,930
fashion and this part of of structures that

1346
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:02,350
what what what you want to

1347
01:42:02,390 --> 01:42:05,160
add to our system is

1348
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:08,580
so as you go flat because i think that it's better to

1349
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:11,100
start looking for from from this one

1350
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:13,940
let because

1351
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:17,910
today's lecture this this one is completely not

1352
01:42:17,930 --> 01:42:20,120
connected with information retrieval

1353
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:23,710
and we need to introduce one more structure

1354
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:26,160
so that's

1355
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:28,230
and with some incubation

1356
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:31,160
i want to give you a real problem

1357
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:37,600
so we doing indexing of our collection and imagine that all this collection is coming

1358
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:43,350
character recognition text

1359
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:45,290
and the problem with

1360
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:49,230
optical character recognition that is that we have

1361
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:51,850
pretty big number of our

1362
01:42:51,870 --> 01:42:54,060
so i really

1363
01:42:54,060 --> 01:42:57,770
it has talked to our customer who

1364
01:42:57,790 --> 01:42:59,310
you this system

1365
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:00,730
morning as

1366
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:09,280
so i think get where we were last time

1367
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:16,290
we talked last time about

1368
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:21,450
experimental design

1369
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:28,880
and not just elegant very careful to and having organisms that bred true in a

1370
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,390
lot of work went into that

1371
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:33,020
we talked about his

1372
01:43:33,070 --> 01:43:36,400
observations and his

1373
01:43:36,450 --> 01:43:37,780
really great

1374
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,480
choice count

1375
01:43:39,490 --> 01:43:45,860
we talked about his ability to look at numbers that were approximate and somehow intuit

1376
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:49,700
what was interesting about them and we had to take rough numbers and say

1377
01:43:49,710 --> 01:43:52,190
and i think this is a three-to-one ratio

1378
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:54,310
although that was an abstraction

1379
01:43:54,490 --> 01:43:57,860
but it's a very good one and his partner and it's hard to know when

1380
01:43:57,860 --> 01:44:01,680
to make those leaps and when you're you're kidding yourself but mendel got a lot

1381
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,310
of data i didn't mention

1382
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:07,870
that he worked on not just around and recalled but he worked on seven

1383
01:44:07,930 --> 01:44:09,810
different traits

1384
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:12,770
across people at all seventy

1385
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,210
show these

1386
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:17,320
very consistent properties of

1387
01:44:17,410 --> 01:44:24,010
going those are recessive and dominant phenotype in the first generation the dominant phenotype by

1388
01:44:24,010 --> 01:44:30,260
definition was evident in full force and in the second generation we saw three-to-one segregation

1389
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:34,240
he felt pretty good about that he made other predictions based on this and he

1390
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:35,380
was able to

1391
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:40,320
put together very coherence story and as i also explained last time

1392
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:42,770
some like a stone

1393
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:48,270
it was an orderly abstract story the idea that there were these

1394
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:53,680
articles inheritance factors of inheritance you can put your finger on and people hate stuff

1395
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:57,240
you can put your finger on they say it's just the model

1396
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,760
as i mentioned last time

1397
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:06,050
the discovery of chromosomes in cell

1398
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:09,960
was really laid the foundation for the beginning of

1399
01:45:10,110 --> 01:45:17,710
a rebirth of interest in men lysm in medals ideas and

1400
01:45:17,730 --> 01:45:20,790
the interesting part of that

1401
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:27,390
characterisation of chromosomes was the choreography that we talked about last time that normally in

1402
01:45:29,110 --> 01:45:34,440
going undergoing mitosis normal mitotic division to make more and more cells when you stay

1403
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:37,960
in the cells and look at them before they went into meiosis you of these

1404
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:42,670
acts like structures however many there were they lined up along the midline of the

1405
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:45,960
period then two

1406
01:45:45,970 --> 01:45:50,540
sometimes you can even see them kind of attached to

1407
01:45:50,570 --> 01:45:54,770
something pulling them back and they would pull back to make two cells

1408
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:57,230
each of which had half of px

1409
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:01,740
somebody as last time i drew drew four chromosomes was that the cells have four

1410
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:06,690
chromosomes and the answer is no it's because i have room to draw four chromosomes

1411
01:46:06,690 --> 01:46:11,080
in that cells so this time i drew six chromosomes to indicate that you can

1412
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:14,030
have different numbers of chromosomes they are usually

1413
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:18,390
but i should note not always an even number of chromosomes in

1414
01:46:18,430 --> 01:46:26,090
a higher organisms but anyway so i do six this time and what's interesting was

1415
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:32,280
this meiosis the generation of sperm and eggs for example in animals there the chromosomes

1416
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:36,480
lined up with the different choreography they lined up in pairs and were you could

1417
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:41,960
see differences in the shapes of chromosomes like maybe the little crossing point was lower

1418
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:46,220
down they would appear or the chromosomes are shorter in length they would appear to

1419
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:48,290
find their own partner

1420
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:52,320
the one that had the same basic shape and they line up in pairs and

1421
01:46:52,370 --> 01:46:55,830
they would undergo a series of two divisions a myopic

1422
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,810
one division meiosis one

1423
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:02,370
and a second division meiosis two

1424
01:47:02,450 --> 01:47:04,170
and in meiosis one

1425
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:07,860
you would get one copy of each

1426
01:47:08,930 --> 01:47:11,560
then it would undergo a second

1427
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:17,040
machine in this sense the regime describes the character tone

1428
01:47:17,110 --> 01:47:18,590
of the society

1429
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:21,800
what a society finds most

1430
01:47:22,990 --> 01:47:24,380
what it looks

1431
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,400
up to

1432
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:30,110
you can't understand regime

1433
01:47:30,130 --> 01:47:34,300
unless you understand so to speak what it stands for

1434
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:39,060
what are people stand for what they what they look up to

1435
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:42,580
as well as its again it's structure of

1436
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:48,440
institutions and rights and privileges

1437
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:54,240
this raises a further set of questions that we will consider over the term how

1438
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:57,140
power regimes founded

1439
01:47:57,150 --> 01:47:59,210
the founding of regimes

1440
01:47:59,210 --> 01:48:02,910
what brings them into being and sustained them over time

1441
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:06,440
the thinkers like tocqueville for example regimes

1442
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:13,760
are embedded in the deep structures of human history that had determined over long centuries

1443
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:18,600
the shape of our political institutions in the way we think about them

1444
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:22,760
other voices within the tradition play-doh marke valley

1445
01:48:22,890 --> 01:48:24,580
so come to mind

1446
01:48:24,590 --> 01:48:31,270
i believe that regimes can be self-consciously founded through deliberate acts of great statesmen or

1447
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,040
founding fathers

1448
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:35,320
as we might call them

1449
01:48:35,330 --> 01:48:36,530
the statesman

1450
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:41,900
lockyer valley for example refers to romulus moses cyrus

1451
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:43,240
is the founders

1452
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:45,290
it looks to we might think of

1453
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:48,830
mean like washington jefferson adams and the like

1454
01:48:51,310 --> 01:48:52,930
and institutions

1455
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:58,530
the very first of the federalist papers by alexander hamilton even begins by posing this

1456
01:48:58,530 --> 01:49:01,960
question in the starkest terms

1457
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:04,100
it has been frequently remarked

1458
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:05,820
hamilton writes

1459
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:09,480
that seems to have been reserved to the people of this country by their conduct

1460
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:13,500
and example to decide the important question

1461
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:18,880
whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection

1462
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:20,710
and choice

1463
01:49:20,710 --> 01:49:27,130
or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and

1464
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:30,190
there we see

1465
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:36,750
hamilton asking the basic questions about the founding of political institutions are they created is

1466
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:41,080
he is he puts it by reflection and choice that is to say by deliberate

1467
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:45,940
act of statecraft and in conscious human intelligence

1468
01:49:45,950 --> 01:49:52,500
or are regimes always the product of accident circumstance custom

1469
01:49:57,260 --> 01:50:02,300
but the idea that regimes may be created or found founded by a set of

1470
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,900
deliberate act raises

1471
01:50:04,910 --> 01:50:11,720
a further questions that we will study and is inseparable from the study of regimes

1472
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:14,300
this park

1473
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:16,580
cause statesman

1474
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:20,630
what is the statement

1475
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:27,080
again one of the oldest questions of political science very rarely asked by the political

1476
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:29,300
science of today

1477
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:34,530
it is very skeptical of the language of statesmanship

1478
01:50:34,530 --> 01:50:40,030
it's all the sense political science simply was a science of statecraft

1479
01:50:40,110 --> 01:50:42,500
it was addressed to statesman

1480
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:48,110
what potential statesman charged with steering the ship of state

1481
01:50:48,130 --> 01:50:51,000
what are the qualities necessary

1482
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:54,590
first sound statesmanship how to statecraft

1483
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:57,880
differ from other kinds of activities

1484
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,770
mister good statesman

1485
01:50:59,790 --> 01:51:01,310
played believe

1486
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:02,690
for example b

1487
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:04,300
the philosopher

1488
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,140
first poetry mathematics

1489
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:08,980
in metaphysics

1490
01:51:09,030 --> 01:51:12,440
or statesmanship as aristotle believed

1491
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:18,300
a purely practical skill requiring judgement based on deliberation

1492
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:22,470
and experience

1493
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:25,140
his streak of cruelty

1494
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:30,360
and the willingness to act immorally necessary for statecraft

1495
01:51:30,410 --> 01:51:32,020
this market valley

1496
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:38,370
the number of test items are called projective models and models which don't are not

1497
01:51:38,370 --> 01:51:44,770
affected by permutations of the way items are labelled are called exchangeable models okay  and the nice

1498
01:51:44,770 --> 01:51:52,350
thing with the CRP is that it is both projective and exchangeable okay and in

1499
01:51:52,350 --> 01:51:59,190
the case of partitioning what is meant by projectivity is the following so so

1500
01:51:59,190 --> 01:52:04,390
I guess first I have to define what is a projection of a partition so imagine we have a set S

1501
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:08,810
and we have a partition of the set S and we have a subset S prime of

1502
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:13,530
S okay then the projection of row onto S prime is simply you take our

1503
01:52:13,530 --> 01:52:18,450
partition of S and then remove everything that's not an S prime and that's gonna

1504
01:52:18,450 --> 01:52:24,970
lead us to a partition of S prime right so for example the projection

1505
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:29,330
of this partition of one  two nine onto the subset of one two six is

1506
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:39,810
gonna be this partition of one  to six okay and a projective random partition's basically

1507
01:52:39,810 --> 01:52:45,430
that if we sample from a partition from a distribution of the partitions given by

1508
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:50,770
P M and we project it down to the set one to N then this

1509
01:52:50,770 --> 01:52:58,850
is a random partition and and the marginal distribution of this partition has to

1510
01:52:58,850 --> 01:53:05,350
be the same as  as what we had to begin with

1511
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:18,290
why this thing is doing this sorry okay I'll just show you the Chinese restaurant process is projective because

1512
01:53:18,290 --> 01:53:22,080
firstly we can derive it from the finite mixture model and we know that the finite

1513
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:27,550
mixture model is projective another reason why it is projective is basically because we've

1514
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:34,070
defined it sequentially so it has to be projective and a nice the reason why

1515
01:53:34,070 --> 01:53:40,330
we're interested in projective models is that it does is that whether there are additional

1516
01:53:40,330 --> 01:53:45,630
data items that we urned and we did not observe shouldn't affect our inference based

1517
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:50,630
on the data items that we did observe and also this also means that we

1518
01:53:50,630 --> 01:53:55,170
can do prediction in a kind of a consistent manner and to kind of learning

1519
01:53:55,170 --> 01:54:04,130
sequentially in a self-consistent manner as well how about exchangeable random partitions we say that a distribution over

1520
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:10,610
partitions is exchangeable if it is in variance to the way the elements of S are

1521
01:54:10,650 --> 01:54:17,250
label so the probability of this partition should be equal to the probability of this

1522
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:23,650
partition  whereas sigma is a permutation of one to N so if you permute it all in way

1523
01:54:23,650 --> 01:54:30,890
in which the data items are labelled then it shouldn't change the probability of our partition again the

1524
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:36,790
CRP is also exchangeable because again the finite mixture model is exchangeable basically

1525
01:54:36,790 --> 01:54:44,040
because the IID given the mixing proportions and given the cluster parameters and another reason

1526
01:54:44,040 --> 01:54:48,080
is that if you look at the probability of a particular partition under the EPP F

1527
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:53,230
of the CRP then it actually doesn't depend on the identities of the elements of

1528
01:54:53,230 --> 01:54:57,930
S alright so we can see this actually I'll come back here so this thing here

1529
01:54:57,930 --> 01:55:02,150
doesn't depend on the element of S it just depends on the number of on

1530
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:07,090
the sizes of the clusters and the number of clusters in that partition so in

1531
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:21,070
that sense it'll be projective it will be exchangeable so an an exchangeable model is

1532
01:55:21,070 --> 01:55:24,910
one that does not depend on the arbitrary way in which the data items are

1533
01:55:24,910 --> 01:55:35,350
indexed so there's kind of a fundamental theorem called De Finetti's theorem which relates to this idea of

1534
01:55:35,350 --> 01:55:41,950
projectivity and exchangeability  and I guess I need to define it something else again so

1535
01:55:41,950 --> 01:55:45,870
imagine that we have a sequence of random variables X one X two X

1536
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:50,270
three and so forth and  it's an infinite sequence we say that this sequence is infinitely

1537
01:55:50,270 --> 01:55:58,020
exchangeable if the joint probability of any N  of the variables is in variance

1538
01:55:58,070 --> 01:56:02,650
to permutations  of the variables okay so this is related to the effect

1539
01:56:02,650 --> 01:56:07,930
that  given our data set so imagine that X is our data set if

1540
01:56:07,930 --> 01:56:11,420
you observe X one to X N our model of X one to X N

1541
01:56:11,420 --> 01:56:16,750
shouldn't depend on the way that the data items are labelled so this is our

1542
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:22,670
model and it is in variance to the way to to permutations of the way the data

1543
01:56:22,690 --> 01:56:30,430
items are indexed and this idea of infinitely exchangeable sequence is basically a generalization

1544
01:56:30,450 --> 01:56:35,270
of IID  random variables right so if we have a sequence of IID random variables they

1545
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:40,430
are all independent and all sampled from some distribution then of course they will be infinitely

1546
01:56:40,430 --> 01:56:48,370
exchangeable despite construction and in fact we can construct infinitely exchangeable sequences as mixtures of

1547
01:56:48,370 --> 01:56:53,570
this IID  random variables so the idea is that we have some latent variable G

1548
01:56:53,570 --> 01:56:59,620
and it's gonna be unobserved and they have some prior given by P of G and

1549
01:56:59,620 --> 01:57:05,950
given G the N  the first N  data items are gonna be IID with

1550
01:57:05,950 --> 01:57:13,000
distribution that is described by G okay and if we integrate it out  G so because

1551
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:17,470
it's unobserved then we are then we'll end up with a joint probability of X

1552
01:57:17,470 --> 01:57:24,250
one to X  N there's that would be exchangeable it turns out

1553
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:29,590
that any such infinitely exchangeable sequence of random variables has to

1554
01:57:29,590 --> 01:57:35,510
have a form given by this so and that's  De Finetti's theorem okay that

1555
01:57:35,510 --> 01:57:42,370
there's kind of a one-to-one correspondence between infinite exchangeable sequences and mixtures of IID random

1556
01:57:42,370 --> 01:57:51,250
variables and this is quite an important prior fundamental theorem in bayesian statistics because it's quite
