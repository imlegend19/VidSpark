1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,270
you can pay if you want to up to a couple of thousand from a

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,670
total of this stuff and the cheapest you'll get out of it in the duty-free

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,170
is one hundred forty euros for this ridiculous little

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:16,460
top it and my wife tells me it's absolutely wonderful i made a stupid mistake

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,280
when i was traveling three weeks in a row one occasion of going insane i'm

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,770
really going to get something nice and this nice lady in the duty-free told library

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,790
and swears that the most fantastic thing ever and you're trapped after that because there's

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,020
no going back but here's the point

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,880
you go into the department store and you got these tiny little tops maybe about

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,130
that size

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,190
and it's cost one hundred forty years they'll give you a sample

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,790
which is about and they are tens of what's inside the tub

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,130
it's fantastic if you've got ten those in fact if you go on ebay you

14
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,070
can buy the samples they couldn't give a damn it costs them money

15
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:59,020
because of the norm of reciprocity they know that when they give you a gift

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,480
they can more easily get you went and by the way this month

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,860
if you buy that we have an extra small gift with three sample sizes this

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,090
nice pouch and so on and so forth and they know they will close sixty

19
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,210
seventy percent more you want to the supermarket somebody is giving out samples of chocolate

20
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,750
cake you don't want chocolate cake you don't like chocolate well maybe you like it

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,480
if you don't want to you definitely don't need it

22
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,040
you try to avoid eye contact you take a little piece and you know you're

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,690
not going to buy it even though you have sampled the and actually putting trial

24
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,790
you're wondering why am i doing this and you think i'll take it off and

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,170
put on the shelf around the corner but you don't you buy it that sonoma

26
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:42,150
reciprocity when you catch somebody doing something right when you give them recognition one squirt

27
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,710
dopamine they feel better

28
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,420
they want to do it again secondly they want to pay you back

29
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,710
you become more charismatic more appealing some the more engaged they want to give you

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,790
what you want you just want them to engage in a little bit more to

31
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,460
work with the work when you've made it clear what you want

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,380
and then you provide them with this then you get that reciprocal action

33
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,840
this is really really interesting area let me let me give you a little bit

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,440
of greek mythology education

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,380
really really fast and some of you may have heard of this particular myth of

36
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:24,030
pygmalion and galatea the psychologist talk about the pygmalion complex of the pygmalion effect i

37
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,340
should say

38
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,750
and it's it describes

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,590
the fact it describes an effect that has been established over forty fifty years of

40
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,090
research that the single

41
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:43,110
the most important factor in raising the performance of an individual is the expectation

42
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,070
that that person's leader has of the pygmalion effect just like pygmalion

43
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,630
imagining the perfect woman and carving the absolute perfect figure of a woman that you

44
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,650
can imagine in his mind and it came to life

45
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:03,860
like the sculptor pygmalion leader having high expectations of the people they work for

46
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,860
has the biggest of all of the impacts has the the

47
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,480
the most significant impact on raising persontoperformance now nineteen thirty two

48
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,290
a guy called dale carnegie wrote a book that you've probably heard of called how

49
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,250
to win friends and influence people

50
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,730
and and some people say i think they say it sold more copies in the

51
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,300
twentieth century the the bible and things like that but is the key one of

52
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,940
his principles and there was very simple

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,540
he said if you want to get the best of people

54
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,920
give them a high reputation

55
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,000
to live up to

56
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,610
set the bar high

57
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,130
when i first joined this company

58
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:50,790
i was originally running the irish and and united kingdom organisations and i so our

59
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,960
organisation is based on an agency or distributorship agreement and i i was an independent

60
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,270
businessperson running the irish and UK operations

61
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:04,190
and they adopted me and to what my colleagues called the dark side to to

62
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,340
work with the corporate team and it's about school when he the founders of the

63
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,270
i brought me out to dinner fill me full cocktails before we negotiate the money

64
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,610
by the way of course they didn't get rich by being stupid and at the

65
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,590
end of the the dinner

66
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,480
so as when we finish the whole thing came up and he shook my hand

67
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,880
like that he said derek you one of the most talented individuals that i've had

68
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,230
the pleasure to work with and one of the things that i like about working

69
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,110
with two is

70
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,020
the quality of what to produce

71
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,560
i think we've ever worked on one

72
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,900
you always greatly exceeded expectations and everything seems to come in on time

73
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,960
and he went on and i walked out there feeling kind of that my head

74
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,570
was full of dopamine i mean i was swelling was coming out my ears

75
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,230
i was feeling great back home to my wife honey i didn't get much money

76
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,400
but you should hear what he said about me

77
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,860
it was great now

78
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,800
clever man whether he knew what he was doing or not he said an expectation

79
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,940
here he gave me what currently called the high reputation to live up to so

80
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,650
the first time he said to me i needed to work on such such what

81
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,710
did i do

82
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,670
exactly the same as i would have done except i worked on it longer

83
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,570
harder and even though we set up a little bit higher than i thought it

84
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,860
was capable of attending push for he knew me well enough to know what i

85
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,860
was capable of what strengths i had what areas i need to develop and then

86
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,150
he said hey i needed to do this he just said here's where i thought

87
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,040
i could achieve here's what he thought i could achieve

88
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,500
and because he gave me the reputation stretch

89
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,170
pygmalion his car having the perfect person the perfect performance and what happens when i

90
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,020
i pulled myself up there's a well

91
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,130
i could do well

92
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,130
i'd better than i thought

93
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,210
two things happened one is

94
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:58,040
well he knows this stuff he knows me better than i know myself there's charisma

95
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,540
when i'm around him

96
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,290
i do better that's charisma that's engagement leaders expectation your expectations of people that you

97
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,400
work for you are tremendously important but you have to know them

98
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,590
at the level that we spoke about their earlier on the second thing that happens

99
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,790
when you

100
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,320
when that somebody achieves at that level is they suddenly become galaxy here

101
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,110
they say

102
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,860
o g i know i could do that and the second most

103
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:32,250
important factor in driving a person's performance and productivity and achievement is their expectations of

104
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,920
a good leader

105
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,540
knows people well enough

106
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,060
to set the bar there

107
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:43,540
when they pull themselves there they raise their expectations themselves what do you do that

108
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,070
you know well enough just to raise a little bit more and you get this

109
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:55,230
in fact

110
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,770
go wrong

111
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,860
saying that

112
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,990
that is they can get model

113
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,440
so wrong

114
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,590
one of these

115
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:52,100
we had a

116
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,890
you can be in

117
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,940
turn it should be

118
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,890
you that's

119
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,290
it is

120
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,430
come on

121
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,610
they do not

122
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,740
they later

123
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,490
you know

124
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,490
good well

125
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,570
o of

126
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,860
of a

127
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:34,100
this 1 here is what hydrogen women had electrons that's isoelectronic with helium

128
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:41,050
this thing here this is just a naked proton so it doesn't it doesn't work

129
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:41,610
it doesn't work

130
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:53,010
so we need to find another schemes and that solution was provided for us by

131
00:12:53,110 --> 00:13:03,550
GM lewis GM lewis and he asks the question what is

132
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:09,540
if we share

133
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:18,910
electrons and by no means the valence electrons and what if we could share what

134
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,800
if we could share electrons well let's look at it and see what happens well

135
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,170
we know that hydrogen is 1

136
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:33,160
so we take another hydrogen stick over here 1 as we know we have electron

137
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,090
here and let's say

138
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,530
the x denotes the other the electron from this hydrogen and now we form

139
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:55,470
a bond but we have well this is isoelectronic with helium and so is the

140
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,270
isoelectronic with helium

141
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,030
and so we think we can and we have a lot of both each hydrogen

142
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,610
has access to each electron

143
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,630
and now we have a satisfied systems that we can do the same thing with

144
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,610
what we're going to have to do with nitrogen atoms but this is the case

145
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:17,490
where we have would have to work to have sharing electrons and

146
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:25,050
in general we have sharing of 2

147
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:41,840
sharing to achieve electrons octet stability let's take a look at let's look at nitrogen

148
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,910
to see if it goes to succeeded that applies that applies here as well as

149
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:51,860
well we know nitrogen has what nitrogen is of 1 s 2 2 s 2

150
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,390
to the 3

151
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:04,300
we've got 5 electrons here and there in the valence shell it we take nitrogen

152
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:10,950
and let's just go 1 2 3 1 4 5

153
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:21,390
1 2 3 4 5 . 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 1

154
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,750
2 3 4 5 6 7 8

155
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,770
we got to cases where each 1 of those things now

156
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,520
this isoelectric within the neon

157
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,900
and we have achieved octet stability I

158
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:47,330
in the in the same way right so Lewis called this

159
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,450
because called collaborative

160
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,270
for example used

161
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,950
of valence

162
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:08,170
the lecture right so you take the call here

163
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:17,310
and we take the valence here and that comes called valence

164
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:22,350
right covalent right and let's be a little

165
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:41,650
need of little terminology here in this region in here contains the bonding domains right

166
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:46,030
and than non bonding electrons are not

167
00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:02,730
nonbinding domains and this structure that's that I depicted using the axes the knows what

168
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,190
is called the Lewis structure

169
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:17,740
that is called it's called Lewis structure and that's

170
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:23,450
this is actually from Lewis's notes now remember

171
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,500
but this is 1902 so that was a whole lot going on there was a

172
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,450
lot of physics going on but we don't know a whole lot about atomic structure

173
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,100
back in those days but you can see this is right out of his

174
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,760
right out of his notebook and you can see arranged the adams by road and

175
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,330
he's trying to figure out the lithium has 1

176
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:49,630
beryllium magnesium have to boron aluminum have 3 and he's trying to figure out how

177
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,390
to arrange these things this is right out of his relatives noble and look up

178
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,020
at the top

179
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:02,430
got a bit of a mistake the trying helium octet stable he tried but the

180
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,150
electrons around helium in working but look down here

181
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,420
you electric field may be

182
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,130
that's assuming the down direction smaller smaller here

183
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,490
smaller smaller even than zero zero zero here and here the electric field be like

184
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,530
and that whole pattern then

185
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,150
standing wave

186
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,780
so this is down this is up and also it's like that this is always

187
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:37,030
he's always nodal lines

188
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,670
imagine now

189
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,970
that is and is open

190
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,920
so i just removed the short circuit

191
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,780
and i leave it open

192
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,170
i hope you remember

193
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,690
the experiments we did with strings

194
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,530
this is really the equivalent of this training is attached

195
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,320
so you get to know there

196
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,780
reflectivity is minus one mountain comes back as very

197
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,340
this no

198
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,900
when the entries of

199
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,420
so there nothing at the end completely nothing

200
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,670
that is the situation that it is right now by the way this is completely

201
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,570
open is why here

202
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,200
this is why are not connected

203
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,360
so in this is open

204
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,320
you expect the reflectivity

205
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,570
of plus one

206
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:33,240
just like with the story that the mountains comes back as amount

207
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,920
and if that's the case

208
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,150
then you get the maximum

209
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,240
of the if you get an and sign up here right here in the middle

210
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,110
you get you know to lines and right here in the middle you get you

211
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,170
know old ones

212
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,880
so we get this shift of one-quarter wavelength

213
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,130
from where you only have notable

214
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:55,070
lines you get now and high nodes and where you had earlier and i note

215
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,530
you know get nodes

216
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,380
so this is open

217
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,400
these i don't know to lines

218
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,630
so those the locations

219
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,380
across the y here

220
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,200
where there is no potential difference at all moments in time

221
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,090
so this is what we will refer to as close

222
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,530
i want to draw the parallel with are streams and

223
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,610
i even think that in

224
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,360
my problem sets that i give you a chance to

225
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,450
work a little bit on this

226
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,590
remember was streams we can fix the length of the string in such a way

227
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,800
that we get resonance

228
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,320
we can write string at one end

229
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,690
moving to senior in little bit

230
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,490
and the end is fixed

231
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,010
and we can set the system in resonance

232
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,400
the wavelength that we don't get level of

233
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,030
and being an integer

234
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,880
so n equals one

235
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:05,280
three et cetera the wavelength is into l divided by n

236
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,510
you can also regulate here

237
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,920
and leave this and open

238
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,220
we even discussed that you've demonstrated that

239
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,820
in which case

240
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,260
you get resonance

241
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,010
for lambda and

242
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,860
because for l divided by

243
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,110
two n minus one

244
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,840
and of course the frequency at which you reach that resonance

245
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,010
omega of and

246
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,490
it's always k of and

247
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,650
times the speed of propagation which in this case is the speed of light

248
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,450
OK of and is two pi divided by

249
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,200
the wavelength

250
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,070
so the way i'm going to do this demonstration for you

251
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,610
we have chosen the length of these wires

252
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:58,220
such that the system is resonance when it is open

253
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,510
so we have length

254
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,220
which is four point

255
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,380
two five metres

256
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,280
the wavelength

257
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,150
three point four years

258
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,400
so the lengths

259
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:15,280
is one and one-quarter wavelength

260
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,150
and so when it is opened

261
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,990
richard is here

262
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,670
and this

263
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,720
is one quarter wavelength

264
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,690
and this

265
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,010
is one

266
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,050
half wavelength and so on

267
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,470
if i leave these open and that's what i'm going to do

268
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,320
and i have you lights

269
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,720
it is connected

270
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,400
between these two is that i can slide along so i have the light your

271
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,950
light source

272
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,260
this is very specialised sources

273
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,900
as an enormously high all week resistance

274
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,650
so that when i put it here that i'm not disturbing

275
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,570
the potential difference between the wires are not changing the boundary conditions really

276
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,490
because it is enormously high ohmic resistance

277
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,240
and the light bulb

278
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,220
lights up even with a minutely small current

279
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,570
so the first thing

280
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,800
that i'm going to show you is that

281
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,570
if i turn on the

282
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,780
transmitter which i will use the same one that i have here make sure don't

283
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,490
get electrocuted no

284
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:26,880
so we're going to take this off

285
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,630
and may help actually if we give you

286
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,000
will have lots of

287
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,510
exercises lots of chances you will have an assignment to

288
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:52,080
the play was is a little bit now comes my method number two

289
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,490
message number two

290
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,310
is again as we had with the dot product

291
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,680
is a

292
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,420
geometrical methods

293
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,210
let me try to

294
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,110
work on this board between

295
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,920
if you know vector a

296
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,430
and you know vector b

297
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,350
and you know to the angle a

298
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,680
then the cross product c

299
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,910
because crosby

300
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,230
is the magnitude of a

301
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,810
times the magnitude of b

302
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,090
times the sign of data

303
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,470
the cosine of data as we had before was the dot product is the sign

304
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,680
of data

305
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,960
you can already immediately see that

306
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,040
this will be zero if there is either zero degrees one hundred eighty degrees

307
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,930
the dot product was zero

308
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:55,510
when the angle between them was ninety degrees

309
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,210
this number can be larger than zero sign theta is larger than zero can also

310
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,630
be smaller than zero

311
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,870
now we only have the magnitude

312
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,420
of the vector and now comes the hardest part one is the direction of the

313
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,380
and that is something

314
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:13,680
that you have to engrave your minds and not forget

315
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,880
the direction is found as follows

316
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,670
take a

317
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,330
because he first mentioned

318
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,130
you rotate a over the shortest possible angle to be

319
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,920
if you had in your hand corkscrew and i show that in a minute

320
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,270
then you turn the court through is seen from uses clockwise

321
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,020
and the corkscrew would go into the black hole

322
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,540
and if the corkscrew goes into the blackboard

323
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,480
you will see the tail of the vector and you will see across

324
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,480
little plus sign and therefore

325
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,440
we put that

326
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,520
like so

327
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,680
product is always perpendicular

328
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,510
both a and b

329
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,900
but at least it was two choices it can you come out the blackboard or

330
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,140
it can go in the

331
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,700
and i just told you

332
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,140
rich convention use

333
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,180
and i want to show that to you

334
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,370
in a way that

335
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,750
appeal to more

336
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,080
this is what i have

337
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,700
used before

338
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,830
television help sex sessions i've given MIDI monopoly monopolies made not to be or to

339
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,090
i have indicated here and here is a corkscrew

340
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,730
there's a corkscrew

341
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:34,630
i'm going to do the corkscrew as seen from your side clockwise

342
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,290
and you'll see

343
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,680
that's the

344
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:42,070
corkscrew goes in into to the ball take

345
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,350
and that's the direction that of the vector

346
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,210
if we had to be crossed a

347
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,150
then you take being your hands you're or they would over the short is angle

348
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,580
to eight now you have to rotate counterclockwise

349
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,620
and when you rotate counterclockwise

350
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,500
the corkscrew comes to you there you go

351
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,530
and so the vector is now pointing in this direction

352
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,250
and if the vector is pointing

353
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,290
so it's you

354
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,970
then we would indicate that missus circle

355
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,210
and the adult

356
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,280
in other words for this factor

357
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,600
the cross and a

358
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,610
we have exactly the same magnitude

359
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,660
no difference

360
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,320
it would be

361
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,970
coming out of the blackboard and that words

362
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,280
eight crosby

363
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,480
equals minus

364
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,990
the cross and

365
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,150
as a

366
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,860
doctor b is the same as b built

367
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,060
we will encounter cross product when we deal with talks

368
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,070
and when we deal with

369
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,630
angular momentum which is not the easiest part of it one

370
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,570
let's take an extremely

371
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,770
example again

372
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,040
i don't mean to

373
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,190
and so you with such a simple example but you will get chances more advanced

374
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,910
chances on the assignment

375
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,120
i gave the vector a

376
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,840
x rule for the unit vector

377
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,910
in x direction that means a of x is one

378
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,990
and a y zero and nailsea easier zero

379
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,590
and suppose b

380
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,690
it is why rules

381
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,370
that means b of y is one

382
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,680
b of a is

383
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,020
and you see

384
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:34,660
at the phase transformation from isotropic to nematic drastic change in length here by a

385
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,120
factor of two

386
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:42,560
and actually exist some systems in which show and

387
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,400
spontaneous information by a factor of three to four

388
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,010
if we measure the order parameter again

389
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,340
this typical order from the temperature curve which can be correlated

390
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,710
and from this weekend

391
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,380
a determine the coupling coefficient

392
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,070
but looking at these mentioned polymath

393
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:10,640
and this might be interesting for some people who already know this liquid crystalline elastomers

394
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,210
one very interesting aspect

395
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,760
when we start with the non orders

396
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:22,690
elastomer mentioned last month as mentioned in the beginning of such an elastomer then of

397
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:29,120
course we have an all order parameter of zero because it's polycrystalline material

398
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,660
and then we apply mechanical stress

399
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,880
make microscopic orientation

400
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,880
and actually end up with a uniformly ordered system

401
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,690
the nematic order parameter might be extrapolated to the elongation of zero

402
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:54,580
the most interesting aspect is that this uniform orientation of the systems already

403
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,600
can be observed it and elongation of

404
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,020
c thirty percent then we get a microscopically ordered sample

405
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,900
however if you look

406
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,060
at best

407
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,540
train curve of the system

408
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,460
then we see

409
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,410
and that the orientation process

410
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:16,890
or this behavior which has been named soft elasticity by mark warner

411
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,110
this process

412
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:26,280
and it according to the mechanical measurements about fifty percent

413
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,590
but we see that we already observed in one of the main thirty percent

414
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,710
that's an interesting behavior which is a little bit puzzling

415
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,710
in our explanation is if we look

416
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:45,970
these types of liquid crystal made pollen then of course these problems can form so-called

417
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,610
and when we apply mechanical stress we have to remove these happens

418
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,940
and when we remove these happens this

419
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:03,090
that's not change essentially change the conformation of the polymer backbone and consequently does not

420
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,870
so a change in the

421
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:11,640
entropy elasticity

422
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,310
another interesting

423
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,820
very new results

424
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,780
which exceeds the properties known

425
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:26,180
for these so-called such elastomers which has been obtained by my phd students human calls

426
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,550
this year

427
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:34,550
we again look at the length of the sample as function of the as function

428
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:39,990
of temperature and the order parameter could as function of temperature

429
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:47,090
and from this experiment you already can identify that's not behaviour

430
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,870
which can be directly correlated

431
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:56,140
and the correlation of lang's work because the order parameter can no longer be described

432
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,040
with the linear behavior as in the frame of the land decision theory in other

433
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:07,670
for these main chain systems for this liquid crystal and main chain systems there's another

434
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,590
and if you

435
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:18,700
estimation in calculation of this we see that the length changes with the order parameter

436
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,240
with the power of four

437
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,010
with an exponent of four

438
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:27,030
very strong nonlinear behavior

439
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,040
microscopic dimension and state of all

440
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,360
up to now there no explanation for this type of behavior

441
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:43,860
i think this might be a typical example for a system where entropy elasticity changes

442
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:50,430
into and p lest he due to the chemical constitution of on networks these are

443
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,680
some of these new

444
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,770
network we already this morning source sort some of this curve you see a strong

445
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,120
load on elastomer

446
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,660
the change of temperature and the spontaneous

447
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:09,100
the question is of course when we want to apply the system for example as

448
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,150
artificial muscles it would be straightforward to look for

449
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:18,810
another external he's not another stimulus not temperature

450
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,400
and another possibility to

451
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,100
change the dimension of the network

452
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,970
it is by applying light and with life changing the state of order the state

453
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:36,610
of all the comforts to the microscopic dimension when on very old

454
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:43,200
for example if you such as molecule which is around like molecule if you make

455
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,090
for example cis trans isomerase station of such a molecule then you get end up

456
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,310
with a bent molecule spend molecule locally

457
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:57,610
reduces the state of order of the

458
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:06,040
medically all molecules and this reduction in the state of order should be directly indicated

459
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,940
in the change of the length of the sentence

460
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:12,710
and the very simple explanation of

461
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,860
the these molecules act as so you fallen nematic phase

462
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:25,340
and with the in with a simple linear relationship between concentration at phase transformation temperature

463
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:30,630
we should expect the behavior that for example if you have the town's molecule if

464
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,300
you increase the concentration of this

465
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,080
since molecule of the spend molecule you should decrease

466
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:44,880
the first transformation temperature and accordingly at the given temperature should reduce the state of

467
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,970
this has been investigated in UK

468
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:54,980
during the last years doing with our with our european project

469
00:34:54,990 --> 00:35:00,730
i will give you just one ca one example that is really perfectly works

470
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,300
here we have taken such robert

471
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,020
at constant length

472
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,730
shine light

473
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,280
at a constant length on the sample and measure the retracted force

474
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,710
as a function of of

475
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:20,800
and you see you get a very fast response slower response the stationary state and

476
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,760
it's smooth simple

477
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,730
that is wrong

478
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:31,210
but that in the case of course we've got enough data

479
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,010
if we had a hundred

480
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,760
data points

481
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,890
are there

482
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,590
one hundred data points out there will be no further ahead

483
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,350
simply having lots of samples doesn't help either

484
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:45,420
unless they are well spread out

485
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,140
the the

486
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,960
the main over x

487
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,540
no noise anyway here

488
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:59,640
it's not relevant noise just makes it a little bit more difficult but not very

489
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,390
much more difficult

490
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:06,280
if you've got loads of data that is well spread out those two hundred points

491
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,140
on that one then you need to model

492
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,810
the data and the model of the same thing so no problem there is that

493
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,570
if you've got some noise on that you could still eyeball it

494
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,140
and get a very good

495
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,800
OK so

496
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,670
the questions are

497
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,070
we got enough data

498
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,130
we can see what we've been looking at

499
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:38,110
it's the one dimensional problem that is is there is one dimension to x

500
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:43,110
as the dimensionality of x goes up then

501
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,860
the possibility of seeing what f of x looks like

502
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,300
very very rapidly

503
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,130
OK in two dimensions

504
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,760
it's quite difficult

505
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,570
on the screen to see what the two dimensional function looks like if you just

506
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,050
got a few points dotted around on it

507
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,540
OK is quite good in one dimension with that sine wave

508
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:06,690
it becomes much more difficult in three dimensions and higher

509
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,500
then without the assistance of

510
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,680
LSD or something else

511
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,450
we have no chance whatsoever

512
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,280
my there may be

513
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:19,920
there are several points that can see these things in their heads or whatever i

514
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,540
don't know but i can't

515
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,740
and i doubt that many if you can because you have been in the papers

516
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,190
one thing i would have heard of

517
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,090
so we lose the ability to see some car really get any good information about

518
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,950
what sort of shape are expected

519
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,660
OK so high dimensionality

520
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,840
we got enough data well the number of samples we're going to require turns out

521
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,940
to be exponential in d the dimension

522
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,510
of x

523
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:53,330
OK so without going into any technicalities if you've if n samples is enough

524
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,240
in one dimension so

525
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,740
four our sinewave wave six samples turned out to be enough

526
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,170
OK then in n dimensions

527
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,540
sorry day dimensions we can only enter the power d

528
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,240
so in two dimensions you need thirty six samples to get the same density of

529
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,420
four hours

530
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,700
sine wave original time-life problem and in

531
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:17,950
ten dimensions

532
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,860
then you're going to have

533
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,720
six the pattem ten which is quite large number

534
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,910
OK so

535
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,960
there's a problem

536
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,330
OK that the amount of data we need goes up

537
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:35,100
in order to say that we well sampled goes up quite rapidly with their dimensionality

538
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,530
so the question is how do we know if the data well spaced so only

539
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,040
mention this OK

540
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:45,010
putting them on us on a fixed grid like like i did for that sign

541
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,420
is one

542
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,170
possibility if we're in a happy situation of being able to do experiments

543
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,380
OK so

544
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:58,040
somebody over here mentioned doing multiple experiments

545
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,220
a single conditions

546
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,950
that is something to be aspired to sort of problem we'd love to be able

547
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,040
to do

548
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:09,430
many many experiments at every single value of x and to choose our values of

549
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:15,160
x carefully and then we have a superb information

550
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,700
typically in data modelling problems particularly engineering once we don't have the luxury of doing

551
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,300
experiments at all

552
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,300
what we do is

553
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,740
get samples from

554
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,120
something we're measuring anyway

555
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,130
OK i did some work some years ago for what was then british steel and

556
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,140
they measured

557
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,360
i mean it

558
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,250
about a hundred and sixty pressures and a hundred and sixty temperatures on a blast

559
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,860
hopelessly muddled

560
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,490
one label it

561
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,090
you need to be sure that you get minds and classes

562
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,880
so for the careful KVL

563
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,540
i would like to do is let's started c

564
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,670
let's say i started c

565
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,110
and from c and we got a

566
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,480
in would be

567
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,250
from the american back c

568
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,910
that's hard reversed my little

569
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,600
the trick will follow

570
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,610
it is as i

571
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,620
as my finger walks through

572
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:14,990
and labeled which was the first sign that i see for that

573
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,040
OK so i'm going start from c

574
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,270
and i go up

575
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,240
i start by pointing into

576
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:25,080
the elements the water sought elements and pointing towards the minus sign for the beano

577
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,610
is understood right down the minus

578
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,110
then i go through

579
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,340
they come up to a input on b

580
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,190
it points to the plus sign up to the one

581
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,790
so that's a plus b one

582
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,260
and then punch into the plus sign of the week

583
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,370
so i guess plus two and that is zero

584
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,450
so that that matters which have not as well so this is sort of the

585
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,500
first equation

586
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,900
similarly i can go through my other loops and write down the equations for

587
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,760
and the convention that i like to follow is go to the loop

588
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,970
i i don't

589
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,770
as the sign for the page

590
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,820
the first find the encounter for that

591
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,630
you can do the exact opposite if you want to be different but you know

592
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:12,440
one of the longest a consistent it would be OK

593
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,530
all right so in the same manner here

594
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:20,060
there are four that i can afford equation again one of them turns out to

595
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,550
dependent on the others so end up getting

596
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,120
three independent equations so i get

597
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,060
a total of twelve equations

598
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:32,910
the equations

599
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,030
six elements

600
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,200
OK what and five resistors

601
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,990
there are six unknown voltages and six unknown currents

602
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:45,470
two sets of equations and growth

603
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,720
twelve unknowns can take all the equations

604
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,750
put them through

605
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,210
a big crank

606
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,040
and so that and grind

607
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,210
and if i was really crowell give give this is a homework problem

608
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:07,320
and have grinding grain grain grinding you get your six voltages and six current

609
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,850
OK it works

610
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,830
OK you get from the equation

611
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,450
and this method

612
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,170
just works

613
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,060
notice that

614
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,110
this is quite a wider grubby methods wide-ranging

615
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,760
i get equations and

616
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,300
it's what i've been doing for simple circuit like this

617
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:36,560
suffice it to say that this fundamental methods

618
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,550
is just one step away from maxwell's equations simply works

619
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,160
so what we do is that in the rest of this lecture

620
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,810
i'll introduce you to a couple methods one is an intuitive method

621
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:55,500
and another one called the node method is limited formal but uses is much more

622
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,660
i guess much more errors

623
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,810
and the KVL KCL method

624
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:07,350
method two

625
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,940
so the relevant section to read in the course notes is

626
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,900
section two point four

627
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:21,960
one of the things that would be stressing this semester is intuition

628
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,520
OK what you find

629
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:27,880
what you'll find that has become much easier as majors and so on and go

630
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,800
or if you talk to your desire professors and so on you will find that

631
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,610
very rarely they actually go ahead and apply the former methods of analysis

632
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,040
OK by and large

633
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:44,400
engineers would look at the circuit and simply by observation i don't

634
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:49,490
and usually in the past what it's like to do is

635
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,290
ignored that process

636
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,860
and foreign students that look the former methods and you will know develop their own

637
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,800
intuition and be able to do it

638
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,820
what way trying do this term is distressed the intuitive methods

639
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:07,080
anthony show you how into the process goes so you can very quickly solve many

640
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,460
of the circuit simply by by inspection

641
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:12,590
OK so this method and show you here

642
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,870
is one such intuitive method

643
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:18,690
and i call it the element

644
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,770
combination rules

645
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:28,110
OK for many simple circuits can you can solve them very quickly by applying this

646
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:34,540
components of this method are these

647
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:39,550
i learned about how to compose a bunch of elements so let's say for example

648
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:42,300
i have a sort of resistors

649
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:47,220
one through the end

650
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,750
in cities

651
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,810
you can use KVL

652
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,320
and KCL

653
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:56,890
are to show

654
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,850
is equivalent to

655
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:08,780
a single resistor whose value is given by

656
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,560
the sum of the resistances

657
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:15,290
OK so you have a resistance in series then effectively it's the same as if

658
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:19,490
there was a single resistor values the sum of all the resistances

659
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,570
you can look at the course notes for a proof of

660
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:25,690
for the formation of this fact

661
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,520
similarly if i have

662
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:32,360
it the sensors and power

663
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,120
so we call them conductances

664
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,020
conductance is

665
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:43,700
the reciprocal of a resistance

666
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,240
if the distance is measured in ohms

667
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:50,010
conductance is measured in mos image

668
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,980
so so that's the conductance g one g two

669
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,450
and g three

670
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,990
they're effectively

671
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:00,850
and these are the different voxels here these are the different samples of brain activity

672
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:06,900
and you can divide your data into training and test data the problem is the

673
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:11,440
this question you could very easily addressed in with information theory

674
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:18,480
mutual information for example the problem is that the dimensionality is far too high

675
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,620
for you to be able to estimate this i mean you don't have very many

676
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,460
so i mean how to deal with this this is something that yakov is currently

677
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,770
looking into

678
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:33,190
one way we're doing this is to use in canonical correlation analysis

679
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,480
canonical correlation analysis is a way what you do is you basically have two

680
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,400
multivariate variables you try and find projection of each of these variables

681
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:48,740
that maximizes correlation between these two

682
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:55,370
and then we do this for training data set and test data so you can

683
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:59,320
see that here we do this this is the first canonical variates

684
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:02,980
here as quest as a function of the

685
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:07,900
it's kind of like autocorrelation function some of the multivariate autocorrelation function

686
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:13,280
so basically what actually cross correlation function is shifting the activity in both great areas

687
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,910
with respect to each other and you can see as you might expect to get

688
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:21,490
to peak around zero time lag but if you then go to the test you

689
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:27,640
can see that you get sometimes you get these kind of skewed distributions and part

690
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:32,210
of this is explained by the autocorrelation of a my signal

691
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:38,540
one thing you can do you can you can try and analysed systematically analyse the

692
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:45,040
this cross correlation function here this multivariate cross correlation function here

693
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,330
and then try and c

694
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,780
get the a hint that

695
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,440
information blowing from one brain area to another area

696
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:59,660
and so to measure the asymmetry basically measure the correlation

697
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:06,570
with the like one too positive like minus one minus two and you compute the

698
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:12,290
distribution of these image values and this is what you can see here on the

699
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,540
bottom left

700
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:18,280
is it the colour coding tells you the direction of symmetry

701
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:23,560
basically information seemingly flow from the brain area from brain area a to b

702
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,790
or from b to

703
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,450
and that's on the right here

704
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,570
is a man

705
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:34,940
that tells you that is is very hard to to the coherency analysis that you

706
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:39,030
can do with it e energy is or is very hard to visualize them but

707
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:43,110
you can see here that there are a number of arras tell you information flow

708
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:46,480
from one brain area to another brain area or you could say

709
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:52,240
one brain area having predictive information about the buildup of the pattern in the second

710
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,530
brain areas it to point in time and what you can see here is that

711
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:04,830
this effect seems to hold these two regions frontal polar cortex because this have

712
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:10,730
predictive information of the build up of information occurs later in the supplementary motor area

713
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:15,150
and but according to you have to be careful with this because of course there's

714
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:18,120
is a hidden variable in this hidden variable is

715
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:22,710
the predictive information i've already shown you previously

716
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:26,400
so in this this already says you're going to expect this

717
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:32,190
the degree but i think the key point is this something that is extremely fascinating

718
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:36,890
is the question of trying to find multivariate multivariate conductivity measures

719
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,430
so try to understand not

720
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,310
the consequent activity measure is just some simple correlation that most people use never mind

721
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,740
what this is about is trying to tell you how to build up of information

722
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:53,240
one brain area is related to the information of the brain area

723
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:58,960
and just just to mention that we did more of these studies so this is

724
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:03,580
study where you can see determinants of high level decision means where people again have

725
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:08,850
to make the adding or subtracting tasks so you can see very similar pattern again

726
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:11,060
frontal polar cortex impecunious

727
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:16,480
and another interesting point is that the buildup of this information

728
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:21,790
the question how this is related to other slow process in the brain

729
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:25,710
so there is no other slow process in the brain but really talks about and

730
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,190
that's the default network

731
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:34,140
mister before network is medial prefrontal cortex and petunias these activity in these two brain

732
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:39,200
there's always goes up when people are in the scanner on the avatar

733
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,140
so say your scanner and you have to do ten is the calculation of the

734
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,070
them and then this

735
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,240
default network goes up

736
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,990
activity in the simple network is called full network

737
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,660
what i show you is that is

738
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:58,530
the area is very similar to the areas that contain information about people about people's

739
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:59,870
prospective memory

740
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,100
between the different species in the system

741
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,810
so you have the whole park which has resulted in these two

742
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:11,160
see that

743
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,100
i'd like to do talking lot about feedback loops

744
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:19,270
because these are the things that made in the dynamics and the quality qualitative dynamics

745
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:26,140
you will also see that i chosen image to give you feedback loops into this

746
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,750
no there

747
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:35,520
the point being to actually create when we're actually looking at our research programs

748
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:39,100
remember to actually

749
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,560
look at all the kinds of feedback loops that we will be there

750
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,350
in your self organizing

751
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:47,310
this is

752
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:52,370
it's not always easy to capture ghosts this because

753
00:51:53,930 --> 00:52:02,120
nonlinear one of the of the service

754
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,560
there is also interesting for to me and i don't quite understand how it works

755
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,750
possibly by people study groups in study organisations in a study collective

756
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:16,160
have the water back on local orderings

757
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:20,910
and this is also very interested in self organizing system this is what happens here

758
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:28,180
to merge the essentials influences the time local interactions with tried and this is how

759
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,480
to see what's going on in small interactions and how

760
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,200
eustace is being maintained by the way how is a single point

761
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,850
it's multiple points

762
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:41,450
and how self-regulation is actually

763
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,080
happening now what this is function

764
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:46,620
all the dendrites

765
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:50,200
and to by a chapter at university

766
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:58,200
and created decorative structures from the parameters so that means that the global granulation of

767
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:04,950
the glory i back into injuries mathematical models modelling tool and is able to generate

768
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,680
the local structure and of the structure

769
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:12,370
it doesn't make any sense and i'm making this you human know

770
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:20,140
i don't try to the mathematical model what's in your kind of structure in the

771
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,910
brain to that

772
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:30,390
the ensembles and self organizing systems will continue some ways we call it inuit

773
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:35,560
organisation and this generates new functions and new structure get function

774
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,250
the function possibilities

775
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:41,120
four different kinds of fish monastery

776
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,040
but not necessarily more just

777
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:48,250
and with different information processing capabilities and that's the

778
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:53,910
what kinds of information processing capabilities what structure to get you

779
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,700
and so on

780
00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:00,450
that's a conceptual break philosophical right

781
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:07,080
with anybody like clarification about too general

782
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,080
two months specific

783
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,430
was used

784
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:22,850
and so my data

785
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:26,830
the engineering works the moment and staying constant building block

786
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:33,140
and so decided to apply to pretty because that's a separate from set was understand

787
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:37,810
it was the basis for these these and then when we get to the idea

788
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:41,970
to just a few examples of what did was connections model and that bring

789
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:44,100
in sense down to context

790
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:48,120
so we could just try and terminates on ideas to

791
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,770
use which is that the most important for me

792
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,560
so hopefully that

793
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:10,980
but the school i want to

794
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,720
it does

795
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:32,680
yes it does but now how big is the memory of how much more is

796
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:37,240
needed this the most beautiful beautiful research

797
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:43,200
right i and back to model it was surely the

798
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,680
children and i'd like to look at the time and memory that you need in

799
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,720
order to get to the next one organisation in fact from the fact that you

800
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,450
do in memory

801
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,890
so you can get memory

802
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:00,620
cases have a real-time right here situated in active

803
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,870
behaviour with absolutely no need for any information about what's the before which is what

804
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,720
you find virtual organizations

805
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:10,480
outside of structure

806
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,390
there's nothing that gives you any ideas that strategy

807
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:15,430
new structure that you

808
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:18,160
because when connected to the

809
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:23,660
well inactive

810
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:27,870
you start the dynamic process gets created three

811
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:31,220
the interaction of behaviour of the system

812
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:40,160
so it constantly interacting constantly processing information generating patterns organising certain

813
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,470
well connected increased

814
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,180
you get the transition into a new form of more stable necessary morgan that's not

815
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:51,180
necessarily better able to come process information

816
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:57,930
this is just

817
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:03,810
well OK so that would be a change OK

818
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:09,560
that we should i don't know

819
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:20,180
you know i don't

820
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:25,910
one of the disease

821
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:33,750
well i think that's called meta cognition

822
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:35,370
there's nothing

823
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:37,810
so what you

824
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,290
two technological one

825
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,910
i one instruments one extension

826
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:50,540
year what seems to be similar behaviour

827
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,250
they never married that

828
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:57,040
and then goes to another way

829
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,060
and fact the

830
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,560
large-scale behaviour over time

831
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:05,850
and it's back again and again if anybody can explain this better than that

832
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:10,190
know there are ways of bounding this generalization and  probably the tightest is the PAC

833
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:15,810
Bayes bound  so I'll just show you that and that will be the motivation if you

834
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:22,410
like for the particular optimization if you're interested in this more detail of this I'll

835
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:27,970
be talking about this afternoon  so the way you you measure margin is simply

836
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:37,250
by taking the  the label multiplying it by the actual underlying linear function value

837
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:41,710
so  remember in order to get the classification we're just gonna take the sign

838
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:45,830
of this  function you know if it's bigger than zero positive if it's less than zero

839
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:50,130
negative but obviously we're interested in how much bigger than zero and how much

840
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:54,710
less than zero so before we take the sign we just multiply it by the label so

841
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:59,930
this will now be positive if it's correctly classified so it's a positive example plus

842
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:04,540
one and this is positive then it's correctly classified as negative example and this is negative

843
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:09,890
if it's correctly classified and if it's wrongly classified  it's  gonna be negative so the margin is

844
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:15,210
positive  if it is correctly classified and we're interested in in fining hyperplanes that sort

845
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,950
of keep that margin as large as possible

846
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:22,170
so the margin of a linear function is just the minimum over the training data

847
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:29,470
of this of this margin in fact we typically maximize this but allow some margin

848
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:35,850
errors so  some of the  points may fail to meet that that minimum margin so here's

849
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:40,310
a sort of  classic picture I'm sure you've all seen you know the hyperplane

850
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:46,090
the positive data the negative data and there's a clear separation and the points that

851
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:52,970
are at the distance here are distance gamma or the you know the margin from

852
00:59:52,970 --> 01:00:01,430
the hyperplane so the bound that  I'm gonna sort of suggest motivates this is this

853
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:07,020
PAC bayes bound which basically says that the probability of missclassification of a

854
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:14,730
test point can be bounded by this quantity here now K L  inverse is just a

855
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:22,010
way of sort of inverting this equation here which says that the difference between Q and P

856
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:27,570
is bounded in some way by A so A being small makes P and Q

857
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:34,490
close so if I specify Q and A I know that P can't be too big

858
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:38,950
and basically P's  the thing I'm interested in and Q is my empirical error and

859
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:45,730
A  is my measure of complexity and so this is what I actually am bounding

860
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:49,850
here so this is sort of our bound on P the true error I have to

861
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:54,070
put a factor of 2 in  don't worry about that but this is my

862
01:00:54,100 --> 01:01:00,130
proxy for the empirical error but it's a margin based measure and this is my

863
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:06,210
proxy for the for the sort of complexity term and basically what the empirical error

864
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:13,410
measures is the average of this margin multiplied by mu so mu is a factor I can

865
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:19,250
optimize it's a trade-off between increasing margins here but paying a penalty here by the

866
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:23,910
complexity it's basically the norm of the weight vector that I'm I'm varying here

867
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:30,570
and so this quantity F tilde is just the earth function inverted so

868
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:35,130
it's sort of  the bigger the margin the smaller penalty I pay going to

869
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:40,090
zero as as if this goes to infinity as this goes the margin goes to

870
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:44,450
zero  you pay zero point five  and as you get more and more misclassified

871
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:51,130
you pay up to one  here and so this is sort of an empirical average

872
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:57,050
of the margin and and then this is your you which you can boost by

873
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:03,570
varying mu and this is the penalty you pay for varying mu so now if you

874
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:10,750
think about optimizing this you want to optimize this quantity while controlling this quantity and

875
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:16,630
the slack variable now you can't see this cause there's another line here but the this

876
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:22,330
is the slack variable optimize thing that you optimize and the support vector machine superimposed

877
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:30,010
on this is a line that corresponds to the this quantity here this this sort of

878
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:36,210
inverse of the cumulative normal distribution and so what I'm saying is if we sort

879
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:42,170
of take as a proxy for this this line and so opstim optimize the

880
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:49,070
average rather than of this F tilde of this quantity here and for the

881
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:53,070
other quantity here we just have the norm squared then you end up with this

882
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:59,040
optimization so you minimize the norm squared of the weight vector plus the sum of these

883
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:04,610
xis which are the measuring how far you up that slope  which is basically the amount

884
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:09,520
like this was first marketed that actually this function will be trivial to do

885
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,510
was only able do then is you would sit

886
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,220
CIJ is still to be i the j

887
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:18,850
prior to actually one minus that so that's the type of such that

888
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,620
it's zero only if

889
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:22,480
vertex i

890
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:27,650
of the graph first graph and vertex j after six graph after same

891
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:30,850
and then you optimize away

892
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:37,390
that's not the interesting case we interested in finding more general scientist

893
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:40,730
is the hungarian marriage

894
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:45,040
so let's say here's some hungarian man yes some hungarian women

895
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:49,200
so i'm not very good at drawing and they all need to get married to

896
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,100
each other

897
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,440
and so they all have a preference

898
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:58,860
for each other so for instance hungarian men five like maybe hungarian woman six

899
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:02,870
more than he likes number two number three with a

900
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,160
so they have some pairwise happiness

901
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:07,570
and you know that at the end of the day and they all must get

902
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:10,310
so what you do is

903
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,810
you've been trying to find the permutation

904
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:13,860
which maps

905
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,380
while the hungarian manner

906
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,850
to all the hungarian women

907
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,140
in such a way that the overall happiness is

908
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:27,540
the unhappiness is not minimize so the CIJ from before are basically unhappiness course

909
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:31,940
so it's say for instance hungarian man number three hates number five

910
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,090
c i j

911
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:36,360
c three five will be very large

912
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:42,750
people have studied this problem for a long time

913
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,430
this for instance the on munkres algorithm

914
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:47,610
which sources

915
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:50,920
so just writing out the optimisation problem again

916
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:54,470
so we minimize piping permutation matrix

917
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,400
five IJCAI j

918
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,760
under the constraints applied j

919
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:00,390
has interested in one

920
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:03,150
and the matrix is doubly stochastic

921
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:08,430
you can actually go and show

922
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:11,100
but you can relax this optimisation problem here

923
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,920
which is an integer problem

924
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,630
to one that's a linear programme

925
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,080
so what's different

926
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:20,300
for all i have done is i've just replaced this

927
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,170
integral constraint here

928
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:23,980
one interval constraint

929
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:28,680
we can clearly see that this is a linear objective function point

930
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:32,300
you can see that all the constraints are linear

931
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:36,690
so i've got a linear objective function linear constraint i can clearly just go and

932
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:39,540
so solely by using a linear programming solver

933
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:42,670
you would probably actually do something slightly smarter than that

934
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,130
and use

935
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:48,360
for instance something like quick match or some other algorithms which

936
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:52,860
well space you specific properties of this optimisation problem but

937
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,610
in theory you can do it

938
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,990
now y

939
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:59,510
would actually solve this problem if i want to solve that one

940
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,070
well the nice thing about this problem is that

941
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:04,330
if you look at the polytope

942
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:08,000
which contains all of feasible solutions FI

943
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:09,110
so basically

944
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:12,490
all those doubly stochastic matrices

945
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:15,150
we know that for linear programming

946
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:18,450
the optimality is achieved at one of the vertices

947
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:23,800
anyone would

948
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:29,060
let's say

949
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:33,610
that's the polytope that contains all the points

950
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,270
and if no

951
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:38,850
all those coordinates here are integers

952
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,580
we know that since

953
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:42,340
and optimality

954
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:46,040
five star is going to sit at one of those vertices if they all have

955
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,550
only into integral trees

956
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:54,780
then i know that the solution of this problem is equivalent to that

957
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:59,780
that the phi j's will only be are series one

958
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:03,590
the reason why this works is because the concert this constraint matrix

959
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:06,590
it is so called totally unimodular

960
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:12,280
and it actually a fairly large class of discrete optimization process chapters nice property

961
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:16,460
the reason why mentioning it is because quite often you might actually not find itself

962
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:19,970
related to the truth value of what you put in here

963
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:21,300
because this thing

964
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:24,300
it doesn't have as much interesting logic perhaps it

965
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,860
some of the other

966
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:30,700
but with connected k we can build up

967
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:33,570
sentences of arbitrary

968
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:42,810
for the purposes of classical

969
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,590
we concentrate on just a few of these

970
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:48,730
these two

971
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,260
we like

972
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:52,920
we also like all

973
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:55,660
either or

974
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:56,790
we like

975
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,970
or if

976
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:10,730
a binary connectives put it you put into

977
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:15,020
the negation not

978
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,370
it's not true that

979
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:21,760
is connective

980
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:34,610
just for notational convenience we give ourselves some notation for writing these things

981
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:38,120
and we usually right

982
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:40,510
like this

983
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:43,910
binary operation you also see

984
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:46,470
the ampersand or adopt or

985
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:51,620
other notations or even just simply juxtaposition

986
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,180
for the conjunction for for and

987
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,560
four disjunction

988
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:09,470
we're on the same thing upside down and that seems to be

989
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:14,720
common symbol for that you also see vertical stroke or other things but

990
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,150
this today

991
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:20,040
notations that i use

992
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:24,450
four negation

993
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:29,210
denying things

994
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,670
i shall right

995
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:33,060
this corner

996
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:38,290
you also sees in the literature and places it till the

997
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,500
or a minus

998
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:45,450
of other things sometimes you then see letters for these

999
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,400
OK a

1000
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:51,830
but we can use this column

1001
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:55,030
and it's

1002
01:09:55,030 --> 01:10:01,820
for the conditional

1003
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:06,070
implications material implications

1004
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:07,150
people used to say

1005
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:13,150
i shall use arrow

1006
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:16,460
single arrow

1007
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,530
so those will be

1008
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:20,820
basic connectives

1009
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:25,680
in the literature you'll also see double arrow quite commonly or hawk

1010
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:28,490
or other things

1011
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,580
i guess all the letters c

1012
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:36,250
but will use these and with these we can build up

1013
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,400
of any complexity

1014
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:51,580
right the other thing we need to be able to do with this languages generalise

1015
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:54,480
so we don't just want to be able to say

1016
01:10:57,310 --> 01:11:00,530
canberra is bigger than captains flat

1017
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:02,750
we want to say that

1018
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:07,760
there is some city is bigger than cats

1019
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,130
such that you see

1020
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:14,360
it's never negative so that's the way to the first one and

1021
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:16,410
i want to do do mornings and also

1022
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:19,220
we tend to give human is to try to solve the

1023
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:03,110
so maybe

1024
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,170
maybe i'll give you the ones who have so the first one OK

1025
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:14,290
so if you plug in the definition of the kernel into this

1026
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,800
formula here

1027
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:17,150
you know this

1028
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:20,040
you know what you have to use the

1029
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:22,480
product is actually a linear

1030
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,170
so what does this mean means you can

1031
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:28,380
these provisions inside

1032
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,400
you can also some insight

1033
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:33,680
so what you do is you have to move

1034
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:36,400
the AI can efficiency

1035
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,720
in this part of the dot product

1036
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:39,790
you have to move

1037
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:40,590
a j

1038
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,320
so this the product

1039
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:44,860
likewise you move the sum over time

1040
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,300
here in the hall j here

1041
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:52,940
if you do that then you probably see how it works

1042
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:13,270
don't be shy because of security and i'm not going to work can admitted

1043
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:19,040
OK so maybe i'll give you the solution of the first one now

1044
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:21,810
and then maybe i'll give you a few hints about the other one

1045
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:23,540
OK so

1046
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:29,120
so as i mentioned before

1047
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:34,070
the dot product is not so you can move coefficients in some sense i i'm

1048
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:35,560
actually going to move

1049
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:40,070
everything related to i to this part of the dot product everything related to data

1050
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,800
this part

1051
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:44,160
so then i get this

1052
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:47,140
what i a i

1053
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,250
five x i

1054
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:51,920
and here the sum over j

1055
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:02,300
now if you look at this for a second you can see

1056
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:05,930
this is actually the same as this just

1057
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:10,350
i mean a name for the for the summation index but it doesn't matter

1058
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:14,620
this is the same vector this one so this may be of the form

1059
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:16,720
times vector

1060
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,850
since we assume that is the dot product

1061
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:25,720
the dot product of a vector with itself is actually always nonnegative

1062
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:30,800
o assumptions

1063
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:34,930
this dot product

1064
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:36,740
it can be negative

1065
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:42,560
in any questions about this part

1066
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:59,150
so it

1067
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:01,810
you know what i'm what i'm using here

1068
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:05,370
is the fact that k corresponds to the can be written

1069
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:10,210
the product the product in space right i'm not assuming that k is positive i

1070
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,940
just assume k can be reached

1071
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:13,990
like this

1072
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,370
these angular brackets denote the products

1073
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:20,920
and then i'm using the facts

1074
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:23,050
and plug it in the definition

1075
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:27,080
of positive definite term to verify

1076
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:30,920
what actually is nonnegative

1077
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:35,430
and then i know it's positive definite at this point here under substituting it i

1078
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:39,160
don't know whether it is positive or negative and i go through use the fact

1079
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:43,470
that this is the sort of product i know that in the end i see

1080
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:46,290
that is negative

1081
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:51,540
because and also some hints for the other problems

1082
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:58,200
so in the second problem

1083
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:02,490
the hindus you should consider a set of points

1084
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:06,560
so nobody in the definition of positive definite kernels

1085
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,030
you have

1086
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:15,120
since the end points and coefficients corresponding to them

1087
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:18,740
just to prove the second property

1088
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,760
you should only consider one point

1089
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:24,250
and what efficient

1090
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:26,220
so i think about

1091
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:30,040
liquid again doesn't not some kind of backwards when you think that you start with

1092
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:34,230
gas atoms far apart then you move closer you get liquid atoms and you press

1093
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:36,370
the liquid out to get solid

1094
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,200
but water special

1095
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:43,490
water special because the bonding in the solid is more open than bonding in the

1096
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:47,960
liquid and i can look at this and say because when i press

1097
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:50,190
from solid to liquid

1098
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:54,000
this tells me that the density of the solid is lower than the density liquid

1099
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:55,620
i look at that i say

1100
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:57,470
i scube slow

1101
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,600
i students flow and there are other there are other

1102
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:04,160
systems for which the same happens i hear silicon

1103
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:05,440
look it's silicon

1104
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:09,670
here's the phase diagram for silicon pressure versus temperature you see

1105
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:13,770
down here it's FCC the diamond cubic structure

1106
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:17,560
and if we go there's the melting point of silicon we go to the liquid

1107
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:21,800
it's got more nearest neighbour how many nearest neighbours there's the solid had its sp

1108
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:26,550
three hybrids has four nearest neighbours most liquids have about six nearest neighbours

1109
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:32,380
so when you have these open structures like silicon germanium the silicate glasses and i

1110
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:38,530
you actually go to a more condensed system when you first liquefied and this is

1111
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:39,890
how you skate by the way

1112
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:44,170
you know you down here one atmosphere but minus five degrees c and you put

1113
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:48,610
your weight on the blades so that's the mass which then becomes the force on

1114
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:53,330
a small area which becomes the pressure and then that allows you

1115
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:57,600
the cross this line so you go i don't thin film of water

1116
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,610
and if the temperature gets really cold

1117
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:03,810
it's down here around minus twenty and i've had the pleasure skating one it's minus

1118
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:06,620
my mass

1119
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:11,590
converted to of appropriate pressure on the blades is not high enough to cross this

1120
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:17,270
and skating experience is very different because now it's just it's just steel blades on

1121
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:20,230
and it's you don't get traction

1122
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:22,820
to put it simply you fall

1123
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:26,800
OK you all not good not good OK so let's let's look at a few

1124
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,920
others if we contrast here this is the limit simple fcc metals and what we

1125
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:36,850
see with aluminum in this case it's normal liquid has about six to eight nearest

1126
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:40,390
neighbors and the solid has twelve nearest neighbours so

1127
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:44,070
the solid is denser than the liquid you see that the phase diagram

1128
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:50,100
here's nitrogen nitrogen is are let's see what we have it's at one atmosphere pressure

1129
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:56,510
melting point is sixty three kelvin its boiling point seventy seven kelvin you remember that

1130
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:58,940
because MIT is seventy seven mass

1131
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:02,110
so nitrogen boils at seventy seven kelvin

1132
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:06,110
and the triple point is down here it's it's about one hundred of the degree

1133
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,260
and it turns out it's about an eighth of an atmosphere pressure this is the

1134
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:18,870
triple point of nitrogen ice in boiling liquid nitrogen but this has a positive slope

1135
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:23,570
so this means that the solid nitrogen ice sinks to the bottom of the liquid

1136
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:27,530
nitrogen i thought since it's friday maybe we could have just a little bit of

1137
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:32,320
fun here with liquid nitrogen so i'm going to get dressed first have to practice

1138
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:36,610
a science i have to send an example for you see i this year one

1139
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:41,780
of my staff patrick trapezoid what to wear lab coats i said OK

1140
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:42,790
i tried it

1141
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:44,420
try to do this problem

1142
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:49,430
this is work which which designed did you go to the

1143
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,290
valentino over such

1144
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:57,060
what going because nitrogen

1145
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:59,310
it's gets some nitrogen

1146
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,910
have some fun and so we're going to be working at seventy seven kelvin

1147
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:05,670
and for those of you on the back to put this up on

1148
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:11,620
monitors no food in the laboratory put that over there

1149
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,870
four this

1150
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:24,000
OK so

1151
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:30,340
so the first thing we do is let's let's look at glass transition temperatures so

1152
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:34,430
i have some rubber gloves or have to face crazy over this way

1153
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,760
OK creating to do with this so here's some rubber gloves and so you know

1154
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,310
you can hear that there

1155
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:44,090
are acting lassiter above thirty g so this is just covalent bonds

1156
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:45,750
what i wanna do

1157
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,680
as a former member nitrogen here

1158
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:54,350
and know if you noticed but these gloves are chiral

1159
01:20:54,370 --> 01:20:56,600
just justification or

1160
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:59,040
i chose chiral gloves

1161
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:00,260
OK so now

1162
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:01,040
so they

1163
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:04,270
so the below the glass transition temperature on sorry crazy

1164
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:05,870
get to

1165
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:07,970
so how did one more time

1166
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:14,200
got a glass transition temperature also if you wanted to drill the

1167
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:17,850
if you want to draw the rubber stopper of course now you can hear the

1168
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:20,790
key to the site so you can hear that

1169
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:26,200
it's robbery drop in their little mind its own business also-ran rap it's also got

1170
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:28,040
glass transition temperature

1171
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:29,930
so we can show that

1172
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:34,460
going into liquid nitrogen

1173
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:51,350
OK so

1174
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:53,190
here are flexible now

1175
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:03,070
OK now you can hear how it changes

1176
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:07,360
i should have been wearing gloves and all that

1177
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:10,710
OK how about protein or you know the other thing we can do thing we

1178
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:14,150
can do is i wanna make some liquid oxygen so i don't know can we

1179
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:17,500
just cut to the to the computer slide for second one show people what we're

1180
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,470
going to do here

1181
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:20,950
this next one

1182
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:27,640
so what do is to put a graduated cylinder inside filled this with liquid nitrogen

1183
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:32,610
and these are the boiling points of oxygen argon and nitrogen and nitrogen is at

1184
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:37,980
seventy seven so this is all seventy seven kelvin but oxygen condenses ninety so we're

1185
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:41,060
gonna make liquid oxygen with a little bit of argon ice

1186
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:41,830
the truth

1187
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:43,310
all talking a minute

1188
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:45,310
it says that

1189
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,630
this pattern has

1190
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:52,000
support of this in a slight they don't call probability because it's not a

1191
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:55,430
you know it's only from this particular data set

1192
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,740
therefore they use support so

1193
01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:01,930
in some sense if we feel a bit losing in our terminology you can say

1194
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:03,480
probability of x

1195
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:05,180
that belongs to the

1196
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,200
class i

1197
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:10,060
probability of that pattern belongs to class j

1198
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:12,550
these probabilities are highly different

1199
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:14,590
then we are interested in this

1200
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:17,470
so if the same pattern as in probability

1201
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:18,640
both classes

1202
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,210
then this pattern doesn't tell us very much to

1203
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:24,050
so that's basically the idea here

1204
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:25,120
as long as the

1205
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:27,240
the support is very large

1206
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,100
then we are interested in this part

1207
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:33,930
or you could use some kind of javascript tests saying that you to make the

1208
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,680
so you can control that how big these patterns can be

1209
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:44,990
and then just that what he is he actually used them

1210
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,890
basically decision trees

1211
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:51,500
to build these these patterns

1212
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:53,860
so these rules

1213
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:59,060
you know as i said earlier can be generated from decision trees so for example

1214
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:02,770
i hope you know what decision trees right

1215
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:07,110
so so if you know the decision trees all you have to do is you

1216
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:08,500
start from the root

1217
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:09,860
and go to the leaves

1218
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,130
i say

1219
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:13,300
you know you know by definition

1220
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:15,050
the lead should be highly

1221
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:17,310
dominated by one particular class

1222
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:19,310
which means that expression

1223
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:23,590
going along the branch is basically defined congress

1224
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:28,110
leaf nodes should give you some description of

1225
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:32,310
how get out there and that description is a contest

1226
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:39,000
but unfortunately you know these are greedy methods and generally decision trees tend to one

1227
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:41,970
so they don't capture the whole

1228
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,240
the distribution of these patterns

1229
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:48,650
so therefore you will miss many many useful patterns

1230
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:52,430
so one of the ways you can remedy this is you know if you're not

1231
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:57,470
really interested in all the patterns you can actually feel use random forest and collect

1232
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:02,170
these problems and and of course when you do that and forest sometimes you discover

1233
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,240
the same pattern

1234
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,020
so what you have to do is make sure you know if you find the

1235
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:07,820
same thing

1236
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:15,060
but random forests pretty pretty fast algorithms and you can tell i really interesting patterns

1237
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:21,240
so different contrast set mining algorithms that you know once you have decided you can

1238
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:23,680
see economics going into building

1239
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:28,970
you know variations of this definition variations of several of these algorithms

1240
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:34,580
so for example you might have you might have a very good contrast pattern seems

1241
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:39,390
the probability ratios or support ratio could be extremely large

1242
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:43,600
the individual probabilities are extremely minor

1243
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:45,510
you know for example

1244
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:48,730
it's a very strange and never appeared in

1245
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:49,910
in one case

1246
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:53,060
but appeared only once which is just the noise

1247
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,260
then you say well

1248
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:59,060
you know it has contrast ratio infinity because in one case support is zero

1249
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:00,980
the other cases you know

1250
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:05,420
one and then but still the ratio is infinity so therefore you think it's very

1251
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:08,450
hard but could be brought practical purposes

1252
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:09,840
just the noise

1253
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:11,060
so therefore

1254
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:14,870
people try to put that all these patterns that you're interested

1255
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,490
they should have a minimum support

1256
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:21,480
in the dominant class then over dominant classes

1257
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:25,250
and and sometimes we also have this notion that

1258
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:27,980
they could be

1259
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:30,730
i know there could be some kind of noise

1260
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:33,890
so some patterns are allowed to have some minimality

1261
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:38,730
you know the maximum probability of support it could have been other countries could be

1262
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:46,030
so the latter the the support ratio

1263
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:49,560
we believe that this is a more interesting

1264
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:53,480
o or the difference could be latch

1265
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:58,070
so there's a particular group of patterns that i was telling you which is called

1266
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:00,300
jumping emerging patterns

1267
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:02,000
these are

1268
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,890
quite powerful in the sense that

1269
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:06,320
you know this pattern x never appears

1270
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:08,330
in the in the dataset one

1271
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:11,630
but it appears in dataset two which means

1272
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:14,850
it has basically infinite

1273
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:16,380
growth in the sense

1274
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,620
you know more from zero to

1275
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:22,780
so these patterns are are quite

1276
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:26,560
quite quite dominant quite powerful and maybe

1277
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:30,410
they will tell us something really interesting in order to

1278
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:34,550
the typically languages use these get to language that means

1279
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:37,500
you're looking a conjunction of patterns

1280
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,080
that means feature one taking this value

1281
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:42,780
seven taking this value and features

1282
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:43,380
you know

1283
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:48,400
eleven taking this value this the kind of expression language we try to to use

1284
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:52,490
if you try to use anything more computational complexities

1285
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:55,230
horrible i mean even in this case it's horrible

1286
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:58,080
but is or even worse

1287
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:04,060
so this a particular dataset you know in the machine learning people use this come

1288
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:05,640
from UCI

1289
01:28:05,650 --> 01:28:07,900
university of california irvine

1290
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:12,240
so they have a group of of data data sets but is there some are

1291
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:16,060
inconsistent some are synthetic some

1292
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,560
actually collected

1293
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:22,970
this particular one was called mushroom that is basically the two groups

1294
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:26,480
the things that you can make the things if you if you die

1295
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:28,560
the edible and

1296
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:32,450
all poisonous

1297
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:34,140
so in this case

1298
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:37,320
they collected certain features

1299
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:40,860
i think if i remember correctly it has about twenty three

1300
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:42,080
different features

1301
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:45,540
like one of the feature is this mountain in order

1302
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:47,960
it has gone you know

1303
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:52,920
and then stalk surface you know the stop

1304
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:56,780
with a small tour of when these kinds of things

1305
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:59,160
and and also it has the

1306
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:00,810
the color

1307
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:04,430
and it has a number of rings for example how many

1308
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:05,680
rings it has

1309
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:07,560
and so forth so for example

1310
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:11,590
if you see a pattern like this you know you're somebody brings so much to

1311
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:14,280
and you say oh it doesn't have any

1312
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,640
that smell

1313
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:20,370
and then you see that the start surface below the ring is small

1314
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:22,490
you know it's it's reasonably small

1315
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:27,540
and he has only one ring of these these rings that has

1316
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:31,200
so now we have some knowledge that says that

1317
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,980
the the support

1318
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:36,620
is point two percent in the poisonous case

1319
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:39,000
to see this kind of an observation

1320
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:41,900
whereas in the labelled case we see

1321
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:46,250
nearly fifty seven point six per cent of them had this but features

1322
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:49,390
so we know that the ratio of this particular

1323
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:53,910
these two hundred eighty eight so that means the are

1324
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,000
are much more towards an ability rather than

1325
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:57,930
o point

1326
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:01,600
and of course on this just one if eat there's a good chance

1327
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:03,390
that we must do that

1328
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:08,430
because it is still present this so what you have to do is to collect

1329
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:11,860
many many such patterns and the combination of them

1330
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:13,370
is the one that gives you

1331
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:17,300
much much higher confidence

1332
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:22,200
so here is a nice example

1333
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:25,050
and i'll give you the actual data later

1334
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:30,080
so so let's assume we have two tissues one is normal tissue and the other

1335
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:30,820
one is

1336
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:32,000
cancer tissue

1337
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,680
let's assume that we have somehow selected for groups of

1338
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,480
each rule tells you

1339
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:44,450
one particular tissues so here we have

1340
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:46,930
eight issues four of them normal

1341
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,200
and four of them

1342
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,930
well do that thing with the starting again

1343
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:59,250
so now we're going to look at problems with the same

1344
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:02,990
you know this

1345
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,740
this formula for the energy looks the same

1346
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:08,990
but now we're going to allow x

1347
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,060
to have

1348
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:14,690
multi multivalued labels that we will have to be

1349
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:19,300
and so this is clearly what we want it to go back to stereo and

1350
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:21,600
the the full

1351
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:27,680
stereo problem with all those different levels of disparity so xk is in that context

1352
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:28,570
i will have

1353
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,300
disparity values

1354
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:32,090
and we need to be able to solve

1355
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:38,090
real integer optimisation problem in that case

1356
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:39,970
so what we do this

1357
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:42,820
well here's one construction which is

1358
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:45,880
a different graph construction that there

1359
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:50,450
related to the last one but that is generalized to allow the multiple levels that

1360
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:51,800
were previously

1361
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,120
we had a single

1362
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:58,210
row of nodes corresponding excels and the source and the sink

1363
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,030
rose of nodes

1364
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,980
each column corresponds to a pixel

1365
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,310
and each row corresponds to

1366
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,160
an integer values such as the disparity value

1367
01:32:12,210 --> 01:32:14,180
so now the convention is

1368
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:17,300
if the cut in this graph

1369
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:18,630
comes here

1370
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,580
connecting leaving

1371
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:23,480
the node four

1372
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:28,320
excel with value one connected to the source but no others the source then we

1373
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:31,970
interpret that as meaning that it one has value

1374
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:36,670
big one here has value one a pixel to here has value two and so

1375
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,060
on because of three here

1376
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:39,650
as value to because

1377
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:40,890
that is the

1378
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:44,980
the first one that still can be connected to the source

1379
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,650
and now we have to lay out cos along the edges of this graph in

1380
01:32:49,650 --> 01:32:50,570
such a way

1381
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:52,050
as to represent

1382
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:54,040
the real valued costs

1383
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:56,300
that you see up here

1384
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:01,930
the first thing is that

1385
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:08,940
edges here get into the costs associated with them because it's not allowed

1386
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:10,040
all the

1387
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:16,370
curve here to cut through these because we have no meaningful interpretation of that

1388
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:24,070
there are going to have to take a special form

1389
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:29,370
such that the air for particular into into value is going to be

1390
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:35,120
so the so

1391
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:40,060
this page here is simply f one for this big cutting through this

1392
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:42,630
incurs cost

1393
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:45,130
corresponding to the the the

1394
01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:49,790
the the label on that day the weight on the stage and that that corresponds

1395
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,650
to for the particular

1396
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:54,800
the level of disparity at pixel k

1397
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:57,740
horizontal edges

1398
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:04,370
a little bit more complicated because although i haven't illustrated on this diagram we could

1399
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:06,240
have just not just one level

1400
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:09,430
but two levels supposing i jumped up to here

1401
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:14,260
so the separating cross this and you also this week

1402
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:20,190
then proceeded to the right we would have jump two levels once and so then

1403
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:23,020
the cost incurred would have to be

1404
01:34:23,070 --> 01:34:26,960
he applied to one and three

1405
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:31,700
so what that means is that this function g gets made up

1406
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:32,840
as of some

1407
01:34:32,850 --> 01:34:36,130
of the costs on horizontal

1408
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:37,670
links in this diagram

1409
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:42,000
g one three is constrained to be the sum of g one two

1410
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:44,970
he two three

1411
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:48,770
there's definitely a constraint being applied here too

1412
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:51,500
the nature of this

1413
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:53,200
pairwise cost function

1414
01:34:53,250 --> 01:34:54,640
so supposing the

1415
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:56,660
but see posing the horizontal

1416
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:59,400
links here all constant cost on the

1417
01:34:59,410 --> 01:35:03,510
what gene function with that implements

1418
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:09,640
but i think that was just a unit cost of all of these horizontal links

1419
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:14,130
he function with the implementing

1420
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:15,740
it would be

1421
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:16,880
i guess

1422
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:19,310
the function of the

1423
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:21,990
one and here

1424
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:24,120
the shock

1425
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:27,660
it's just going to be the absolute differences so it's going to implement

1426
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:36,700
x and x prime is going to have before

1427
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,830
he to allow

1428
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,380
x minus ex-prime minister prime

1429
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:47,530
it will also

1430
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:51,230
x is just going to be

1431
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:55,250
the modulus x because what the gene function is doing in that case is simply

1432
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:58,160
counting the number of horizontal links

1433
01:35:58,180 --> 01:36:00,040
the dog crossed by

1434
01:36:00,090 --> 01:36:02,610
by the separating by the cut

1435
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:06,120
as it as it leaps of this diagram

1436
01:36:06,130 --> 01:36:11,240
so define the next level of the next node

1437
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:13,660
so that you know that doesn't sound

1438
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:17,710
a very versatile that's useful function actually

1439
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:20,040
we'd like

1440
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:21,890
what is much more useful though

1441
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:24,560
it's something which is a mixture of that

1442
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,470
the potts prior to the potts prior

1443
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,600
is the icing prior for

1444
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:37,790
labels so

1445
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,060
potts prior something

1446
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:43,430
is function g tilde like that one

1447
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:46,850
which charges nothing

1448
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:52,920
but when the when the difference between prime this is nothing but some fixed value

1449
01:36:54,840 --> 01:37:01,670
it's that function just like the i think belong on multiple a multiple label values

1450
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:05,740
so this is a useful function because it's

1451
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:09,110
it doesn't continue to penalize differences when they get

1452
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:13,920
like for example in the image reconstruction that's very good because what happens is that

1453
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:19,140
when two pixels are different you know the cost very different you don't have to

1454
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:20,150
be more cost

1455
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:21,710
you know it's like saying well

1456
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:26,770
the discontinuity that we follow the edge of one object onto another object and having

1457
01:37:26,770 --> 01:37:30,080
decided that the cost to be paid for having edged that at the end of

1458
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,930
the matter having more contrast across the doesn't change

1459
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:36,430
so actually useful

1460
01:37:37,530 --> 01:37:39,590
it is something in between those

1461
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,020
there's too where

1462
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:47,540
the universal schedule which has been carefully worked out to maximize the benefit both for

1463
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:49,640
the individual child

1464
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:54,290
and for the community and to minimize the side effects

1465
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:58,410
alternate schedules give credence to erroneous beliefs

1466
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,290
and the and so

1467
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:04,700
unfounded fears

1468
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:10,480
i think they misinform by failing to distinguish between good and bad science

1469
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:13,620
it leaves in infants vulnerable by

1470
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:17,740
withholding vaccines for the period of

1471
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:24,290
when they are most vulnerable to the adverse effects of disease and encourages basically free

1472
01:38:24,290 --> 01:38:28,890
riding or relying on immunization immunizing other people

1473
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:32,480
in order to protect your child

1474
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:41,430
finally by spacing out the schedule you're absolutely increasing the cost of immunizing community

1475
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:49,040
have under-invested in vaccine safety science

1476
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:53,330
questions have arisen and will continue to arise

1477
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:59,620
resources to answer rapidly

1478
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:01,290
that are not in

1479
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:03,980
the budgets for vaccine safety

1480
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:10,810
we need to study the factors associated with adverse reactions including the genetic potential genetic

1481
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:18,730
we need to look at the efficacy and safety of vaccines in special populations what

1482
01:39:18,730 --> 01:39:20,930
i mean by special populations

1483
01:39:20,950 --> 01:39:23,020
individuals will who

1484
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:26,790
who have for example congenital heart disease

1485
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:28,740
individuals with

1486
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:32,930
family histories of certain kinds of disorders

1487
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:37,930
we need to increase the capacity to do large epidemiologic studies

1488
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:43,890
i have shown and why they need to be large we need to explore greater

1489
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:45,060
time window

1490
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:47,370
after immunization we we look

1491
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:50,160
first effects

1492
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:52,180
this is

1493
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:57,080
just a quick snapshot of how big a study has to be

1494
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:58,720
to look at

1495
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:00,790
an adverse reaction

1496
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:06,620
so if you're looking at something that occurs about one hundred thousand times

1497
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:10,620
you need about three hundred thousand people a year study

1498
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:14,370
so the last rotavirus vaccine was licensed

1499
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:20,890
was tested in seventy thousand children prior to license because we were looking for an

1500
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,450
adverse event

1501
01:40:23,930 --> 01:40:25,830
with prior vaccine

1502
01:40:25,870 --> 01:40:28,810
occurred about one in ten

1503
01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:32,640
now on to the issue of risk communication

1504
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:36,240
risk communication is complex

1505
01:40:37,370 --> 01:40:39,540
and i'm just touching here

1506
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:44,770
we have a number of in britain biases two of them

1507
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:52,600
just the way we are wired intellectually the omission bias bias is that it's safer

1508
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:53,830
to do nothing

1509
01:40:53,870 --> 01:40:56,790
and to do something

1510
01:40:56,810 --> 01:41:00,700
and i come back to the withdrawal of rotavirus vaccine

1511
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:04,540
we accept that more deaths

1512
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:05,620
rather than

1513
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:09,160
be responsible for aid

1514
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:15,000
compression we overestimate rare risks and we underestimate common is

1515
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:19,930
many of us suspect will never go out of golf course with an umbrella thunderstorms

1516
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:21,680
but you might very well

1517
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:25,520
drive to the shopping centre without putting to sea

1518
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,390
that's it

1519
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:29,080
good example of irrational behavior

1520
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:32,740
the risks are far greater than the way the shopping center

1521
01:41:32,810 --> 01:41:38,160
and then there's this issue is the credibility of your information so source

1522
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:42,850
and there's a belief in the future just remember statement the beginning

1523
01:41:42,870 --> 01:41:46,080
and if you read it well enough to exercise right

1524
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:50,120
your immune system will be strong and you get sick

1525
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:53,390
or you can protect your child somehow

1526
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:55,060
from contagion

1527
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:58,970
but what you feel or how much their size

1528
01:41:59,910 --> 01:42:02,500
talking to this audience it's

1529
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:09,310
particularly important to emphasise that while good science is essential but it is not sufficient

1530
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:16,700
it's complex junk science out there safety concerns are presented as plausible

1531
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:23,180
and people's concerns are by and large often fear-based

1532
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,850
and science along

1533
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:26,620
is not sufficient

1534
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,750
to overcome their fears

1535
01:42:28,770 --> 01:42:30,950
and just large enough

1536
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,560
with scientific information

1537
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:35,660
they have black

1538
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:38,750
often lack trust in the integrity

1539
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:41,240
of the expert spokesperson

1540
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:46,060
and they have faith in told alternative billy

1541
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:50,770
when you deal with issues that are of low concern

1542
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:54,500
expertise is what people look to

1543
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:58,750
they believe you if you are an expert but if you do deal with issues

1544
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:01,390
of high concern

1545
01:43:01,410 --> 01:43:05,950
what they care about is your compassion not expertise

1546
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:09,580
and i love this quote i just found it was from will rogers

1547
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:11,330
very fairly

1548
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:21,200
state-of-the-art segmentations of pretty complicated rich data from bayesian nonparametric models

1549
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:24,180
there's some work on

1550
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:29,790
the word segmentation again using bayesian nonparametric models

1551
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:36,750
you know the the line involved in these papers is the bayesian nonparametric models compared

1552
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,330
to competitors

1553
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:43,960
so that gives you some comfort

1554
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:48,500
there's still work in language modeling with

1555
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:52,180
hierarchical pitman yor language model

1556
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:56,460
which can give excellent results compared to

1557
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:00,180
other competing methods

1558
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:02,830
related work in compression

1559
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:04,770
with the sequence memoizer

1560
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:05,870
that is

1561
01:44:05,890 --> 01:44:08,180
beating state-of-the-art

1562
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:10,000
compression algorithms

1563
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:12,020
so there are success stories

1564
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:18,640
i guess i'm just not involved in any of the work that's OK

1565
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:25,960
so here's another one

1566
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:29,180
from nacional man and holden

1567
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:35,270
which compares support vector machines with the sparse former gassing process classifiers

1568
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:41,680
and the interesting thing here is that on a whole bunch of different kind of

1569
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:44,230
standard-issue CIS datasets

1570
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:48,580
you get error rates for the SVM

1571
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:53,080
and the gas in process and then sparse version of the guassian process which is

1572
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:56,460
actually an approximation to the full gaussianprocess by the way

1573
01:44:56,480 --> 01:45:01,480
but it's a lot faster and it's a hell lot sparser OK so if you

1574
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:04,270
look if you compare these columns here

1575
01:45:04,290 --> 01:45:07,350
if you look at the number of support vectors which is support vector machines are

1576
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:09,370
supposed to be sparse

1577
01:45:09,390 --> 01:45:13,830
here's the number of support vectors for these different problems here is a sort of

1578
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:17,960
roughly comparable quantity which is the number

1579
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:23,480
basis points from sportscaster process

1580
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:27,290
you know sometimes you get

1581
01:45:27,330 --> 01:45:29,410
very comparable performance

1582
01:45:30,330 --> 01:45:31,810
rather than

1583
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:35,080
you know two rather than a hundred and twenty two

1584
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:37,330
or something like that

1585
01:45:37,390 --> 01:45:40,940
and in this one does actually better than the SVM in this using exactly the

1586
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:42,930
same kernel by the way

1587
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:45,660
we could probably better if you

1588
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:51,830
a lot of the kernel learning in guassian process which is certainly very very well

1589
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:56,680
so you want to hear me ran more of the axioms

1590
01:45:56,710 --> 01:45:58,140
yes processes

1591
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:02,560
i'm actually gonna speak more about that in the preference learning workshop

1592
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:05,040
make some more enemies

1593
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:11,640
and in fact i think this is policy but we're we're actually pursuing and much

1594
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:15,000
systematic large-scale comparison

1595
01:46:15,020 --> 01:46:18,000
because people are so damn interested in classification

1596
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,600
so with alex things first replying kind of

1597
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:26,160
really flesh out this comparison little more

1598
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:28,730
OK so

1599
01:46:30,580 --> 01:46:35,290
i want to talk briefly about covariance matrices modelling covariance which is different kind of

1600
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:38,500
structure that we can model here i think we do have

1601
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:44,160
actually this is what maybe there's the trend there's been recent works

1602
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:46,100
where i think we have

1603
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:47,770
competitive results with

1604
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:49,520
are methods

1605
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:55,180
so why why would be interested in modeling covariance matrices

1606
01:46:55,230 --> 01:46:59,210
well the problem of the covariance matrices as a

1607
01:46:59,230 --> 01:47:02,100
change as a function of time or during

1608
01:47:03,230 --> 01:47:07,140
is actually interesting to a lot of people and they tend to be people in

1609
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:08,460
the common

1610
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:13,180
we're looking at the relationship between a bunch of different variables

1611
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:15,910
the change over time

1612
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:19,620
and the models are commonly used in things like multivariate garch

1613
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:22,520
multivariate stochastic volatility models

1614
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:28,070
x this article sigma inverse right so but we at sparsifying regularizer on x which

1615
01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:32,570
is our estimate sigma inverse right now we turn the crank on lambda to trade

1616
01:47:32,590 --> 01:47:34,520
sparsity of the inverse versus

1617
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:37,170
versus fit here OK

1618
01:47:37,570 --> 01:47:41,070
and i mean this is something that's been so i mean just some of the

1619
01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:45,300
things people have looked at it actually others have two including people here it's just

1620
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:46,460
talking to someone before

1621
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:48,360
OK so

1622
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:51,190
what do you do again it's only you just do the x equals the thing

1623
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:55,150
about it will see some splittings that don't involve this embarrassing

1624
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:57,300
splitting here

1625
01:47:57,320 --> 01:48:01,650
and you get something that looks like this here's your this thing

1626
01:48:01,670 --> 01:48:05,690
we know how to minimize that we have to call quadratically augmented

1627
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:09,320
this we have to deal with because that's going to be a soft threshold right

1628
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:13,150
so on the x step you minimize this thing

1629
01:48:13,170 --> 01:48:18,340
and otherwise you do is far side sorry a soft thresholding you do this then

1630
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:21,270
update and so you look at this for a while and you can solve this

1631
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:25,820
you know lbfgs or something like that you look at it long enough and it

1632
01:48:25,820 --> 01:48:28,520
should start dawning on u u we can solve that

1633
01:48:28,570 --> 01:48:34,630
semi analytic actually analytic right certainly can solve that analytical analytically right and the key

1634
01:48:34,630 --> 01:48:37,860
would be to say look without loss of generality we can do this for x

1635
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:42,480
for this unilaterally invariant so you can assume that x is a is diagonal then

1636
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:47,820
splits and it turns out this is unilateral invariant to frobenius norm squared so you

1637
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:49,650
can solve this analytically

1638
01:48:51,770 --> 01:48:55,550
it's just this you compute and i can decomposition

1639
01:48:55,570 --> 01:49:00,750
and then you solve quadratic involving the eigen values and then reassembled OK so it

1640
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:04,420
says that the cost is an idea composition so again you know you're right a

1641
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:11,300
blind script and you know it's not i totally and optimize

1642
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:14,690
and then optimize you get something that's you know within a factor of ten or

1643
01:49:14,690 --> 01:49:17,210
something like that of the state of the art

1644
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:22,960
type think for something like this right which again for maximum coding time i mean

1645
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:27,520
like i five minutes or something like that maybe forty five minutes of pencil and

1646
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:31,630
paper to do that they worked out what the update is this is not that

1647
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:39,840
what we now it was that that definitions up that that section and the point

1648
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,360
there's just by assembling these bits and pieces

1649
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:44,790
you can actually do stuff with this i mean quite

1650
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:48,050
quite quickly you can get something up and running

1651
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:49,710
OK now look at

1652
01:49:49,770 --> 01:49:53,340
distributed optimisation and to do that we're just going to look at

1653
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:58,170
two canonical problems one month in much more detail than the other which is consensus

1654
01:49:58,570 --> 01:50:00,550
and so it's sort of like the canonical

1655
01:50:00,570 --> 01:50:04,440
like it's the first it's the whole world of

1656
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:09,880
distributed optimisation and it's got a beautiful interpretation it's the it's very simple

1657
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:12,230
but i'd honestly want to understand this

1658
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:17,590
you understand all you understand other distributed optimisation problem so OK

1659
01:50:17,630 --> 01:50:20,650
or at least this is a stepping stone to it you we want to minimize

1660
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:21,770
a sum

1661
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:26,170
of functions of the variables and these functions because if you want to think of

1662
01:50:26,170 --> 01:50:29,310
the something i think of that phi is the loss function for the i th

1663
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:30,610
block of training data

1664
01:50:30,630 --> 01:50:33,920
so that that's what it is right it's some something like that

1665
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:37,920
and so you can make some big deal and you could say oh this is

1666
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:42,380
like collaborative filtering because you see i have all these different data sources and they're

1667
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:46,250
going to combine and minimize the total loss and come up with an axe that's

1668
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:49,300
better than any of them by themselves might have come up with something make big

1669
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:51,590
story about so that's that's the problem OK

1670
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:55,130
so we simply write this way again it's quite stupid what you do is you

1671
01:50:55,130 --> 01:50:57,530
allow each one has its own private opinion

1672
01:50:57,550 --> 01:51:01,490
so instead of a global variable x they all have their own local opinion XII

1673
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:05,210
and you have a constraint that says you can have your own good local opinion

1674
01:51:05,610 --> 01:51:08,530
but but it has to be in concert they'll have to be agree with this

1675
01:51:08,530 --> 01:51:13,190
global variables e again it doesn't these things look so obvious and silly that it

1676
01:51:13,190 --> 01:51:17,000
doesn't look like anything good is going to come from this right OK

1677
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:18,650
that's the idea

1678
01:51:20,430 --> 01:51:23,920
just turn the crank u four men augmented lagrangian

1679
01:51:24,090 --> 01:51:29,190
you minimize it turns out this first one obviously splits entirely so the only thing

1680
01:51:29,190 --> 01:51:30,670
you have to do is approx

1681
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:33,520
is approx operator on each phi

1682
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:38,960
then you do all how do you how do you minimize the stadium over e

1683
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:39,920
well that's

1684
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:43,820
trivial this is totally irrelevant a bunch of linear functions that's a bunch of quadratic

1685
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:49,520
technologies quadratic functions is the norm squared i'm ERD minimize that like an average i

1686
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:52,070
mean it's for it's political justice thing

1687
01:51:52,090 --> 01:51:55,400
this can even be simplified more because it turns out

1688
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:57,880
the sum of the dual variables is zero

1689
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:02,710
and so it turns out you end up with a very very simple algorithm it's

1690
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:04,820
just beautiful and it looks like this

1691
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:10,380
it's this it says each what each it's it each

1692
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:16,610
work whatever subunit or agent separately minimize their function plus the linear terms that's irrelevant

1693
01:52:16,610 --> 01:52:20,020
of course is just first statics right was the linear terms

1694
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:25,940
plus this quadratic and the quadratic penalizes you from moving from the last

1695
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:28,980
average and i mean if you send a message to this thing and say OK

1696
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:34,230
time's up please give me what tell me what x is you an average all

1697
01:52:34,230 --> 01:52:38,400
of the opinion local opinions and that would be many the winds averaging work well

1698
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:43,050
because everything is convex and so jensen's inequality says you average and things get better

1699
01:52:43,050 --> 01:52:44,170
OK so that's what

1700
01:52:44,210 --> 01:52:47,690
that's the idea so you get this beautiful quadratic penalty

1701
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:50,790
for everything and you can sort of understand all the bits and pieces of this

1702
01:52:50,790 --> 01:52:53,940
right so in fact this would be a dual decomposition

1703
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:54,800
right there

1704
01:52:54,820 --> 01:52:55,920
this with the penalty

1705
01:52:55,960 --> 01:53:01,130
and then this as you have the quadratic regularisation you me towards the mean and

1706
01:53:01,170 --> 01:53:03,790
makes the algorithm go from quite

1707
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:09,290
are non robust fragile to utterly and completely robust and you can see it's like

1708
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:13,690
a scatter gather to think that you know what it's not even its not together

1709
01:53:13,690 --> 01:53:17,900
even that is is not correct and that the wrong way of course the average

1710
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:22,480
million vectors of size millions the exactly wrong method would be

1711
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:26,820
to gather them all in one place and average them so but i you know

1712
01:53:26,820 --> 01:53:28,920
what i mean by this so

1713
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:34,250
the statistical interpretation is absolutely beautiful it says this

1714
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:39,900
if you want to basically what this is let's do distributed maximum likelihood street maximum

1715
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:45,480
likelihood says i have a bunch of data blocks each each one never have those

1716
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:48,500
are encased that i have i and the only thing i have to do is

1717
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:53,630
only one method i have to implement for each box each box of data the

1718
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:57,400
and the only thing you have to do is approx operators right you have to

1719
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:00,770
be able to minimize i have to be able to pass in this thing in

1720
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:04,460
this thing or for that matter i combine these into one thing i pass in

1721
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:05,800
one thing

1722
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:10,500
and then i had i say minimize your loss function plus the quadratic

1723
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:16,170
but minimizing loss function plus the quadratic has very simple interpretation is just MAP estimate

1724
01:54:16,210 --> 01:54:22,250
x maximum a posterior probability estimation with the gas in prior to the only thing

1725
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:26,710
that you have to implement on each of these data boxes or anything like that

1726
01:54:26,730 --> 01:54:30,980
is a is a map methods so that's it

1727
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,690
it doesn't matter what the measurements are how many there are utterly irrelevant the only

1728
01:54:34,690 --> 01:54:39,790
reason that method you send to the box a prior with the gaussians
