1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
but that composed the car and they have very very little things

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,460
there is also the label f four that we

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,820
we did in collaboration with bryan russell offices in somewhere here

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,050
here our goal was to create annotation tool

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:21,300
that will live online this was also inspired by the CMU game ESP game developed

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,780
by this one and the idea was that you put this on the way people

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,900
will go there and take more objects and this can grow beyond what a single

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,880
up to do

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,400
so these are some examples this is a snapshot of the tool online

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,780
and you can go to the web page and an image will appear and people

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,420
can label objects so here some of the

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,670
later this only going here has annotated

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,230
the boundary of this object and then a pop-up window will appear i will ask

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,960
you what is the name of the subject so here they will say this oppose

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,630
and we have collected all the data we have about half a million

16
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,190
annotated objects now

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,820
so there is a lot of data when we start in is one of our

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,360
concerns was what's going to be the quality that you can get when you ask

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,210
people to label images online because you know you don't really give much instructions even

20
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,670
if you put instructions the were page people and they don't really read them anyway

21
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,920
at the beginning we have instructions here and then remove them until people which is

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,420
the same some mother

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,860
but despite that there is a very good labeling so here are some examples of

24
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,420
the best label that we got so here you can see these three here somebody

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,150
has label all the branches here everything all the details or this just here all

26
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,770
the different towers have label even or the police among the oldest is done by

27
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,840
hand stimulated to some people have

28
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,460
the time in the hands

29
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,730
here from the silhouettes here you can tell the gender

30
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,840
just based on the silhouettes of oscilloscope have very very good quality and of course

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,340
this is not always the case sometimes we get something in the

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,770
and sometimes people get really creative and you have things the these

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,800
which is correlated with the image content but not what we want

34
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,460
or things like this

35
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,090
so these two different labelings somebody labelled the book and then somebody else can here

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,480
just kill them

37
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,550
and and then denoted at some point we also decided to

38
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,550
allow people to upload images and when you that you open a new kind of

39
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,730
you can imagine but will get uploaded and immediately of course

40
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,030
the point that i loved it

41
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,920
and and body parts that were never meant to be labeled with labels

42
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,230
and the funny thing is that so when i saw that there are hundreds of

43
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,360
images like that i removed them immediately and they were all labeled consistently

44
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,150
and of course only a few weeks later i got an email from a mysterious

45
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,440
alien all my images have disappeared have been here a while so i can really

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,300
show you the images but they consider the labels

47
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,960
come to the next scale

48
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,650
so now we move to the millions of images

49
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,940
so now the fence of the powers of six or seven

50
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,340
and here things is really good starting

51
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,550
to get out of hand there are so many images is really hard to know

52
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:27,280
what they are so now things is really difficult to do by yourself so you

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,480
decide to create that few million images just as you cannot do it immediately so

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,780
you have to think of other ways of doing it

55
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,610
and there are a number of air force not about trying to get some of

56
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,050
them i already explained them so one is the ESP game at at CMU in

57
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,590
which what they do is they had this game the players will play on the

58
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,420
an image as a result of playing the game images get label so that's one

59
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,780
way of getting a the labels that is the label and for the we are

60
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,770
trying to get there and there are some of the process will be a lot

61
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,320
of skill that's it that's all the time to get very large databases

62
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,730
so there are different strategies

63
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,070
one thing you can get people to play games on the web or you can

64
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,800
do is higher amongst graduate students closed them on roman said to them good appears

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:20,460
the the label million images and that's basically what is being on going on here

66
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,690
so when that said we created is the eighty million images dataset

67
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:30,550
inc which what we did was we took wordnet which is this electronic dictionary developed

68
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:36,840
by princeton and we took seventy five thousand words that correspond to a known as

69
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,190
the announcer things that could correlate with this well

70
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,630
this concepts and then we took a bunch of all line search engines

71
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,920
so this was done with focus and he will talk a little bit more about

72
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,030
that than its

73
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,070
so we took seven online image search engines and we starting with all these different

74
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,050
so the seventy five thousand words with that over one g and we don't know

75
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,530
the all the images on google this is that

76
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,360
after you know a lot of time when you don't know images we collected eighty

77
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,500
million images were collected more but many of them were duplicates one journal the journal

78
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,360
of them you joined up with eighty million images and there is a website that

79
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,650
you can navigate and it gives you like an index to all these images

80
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,500
another project also related to this is the imagenet done by fyfe and collaborators in

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,250
which they basically do the same thing that they were not to download images correspond

82
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,050
to all these different words but now they choose humans in order to clean up

83
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,460
the labels so they will all the search engines have lot of noise when you

84
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,440
do this one is you don't get what you are asking for dinner and you

85
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,940
get a lot of noise on them and the goal then is to have human

86
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,130
annotators to clean up the labels

87
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,500
so for that they use mechanical turk

88
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,630
mechanical turk is very interesting

89
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,210
application developed by and on

90
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,400
and probably some of you know but for those of you that don't know what

91
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:09,860
amazon is an online site an application that allows you to interact with walkers so

92
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,820
people that have articles small tasks that can be posted on the web can advertise

93
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,420
their the tasks here

94
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:21,610
and there are hundreds of thousands of workers that this is this page continuously and

95
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,880
they will look at what are the best available there for a very small amount

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,210
of money they will perform the task so

97
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,840
here is an example of putin label me a mechanical turk

98
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,030
and so

99
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:38,840
just mechanical for computer vision was made most popular by sonication and foresight in

100
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,530
and they show that you can actually get a lot of work done for labeling

101
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,550
images using mechanical turk so this is an example of justin

102
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,440
label me on mechanical turk

103
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,570
and the way that they will look is that this a header that this typical

104
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,710
of song and then here there will be the task w fine

105
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,210
like in this case place labels many of its kind in this image

106
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,490
and the the image appears and is just basically like the label means interface just

107
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,320
click around an object and you countries the polygon and then it will actually the

108
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,400
name and that's what the work has to do

109
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,010
one of them with the task you click submit and you get your money

110
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,840
and really they don't get a lot of money

111
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,360
generally that's going to be paid one cent

112
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,150
and you can wonder what people can do for one cent well it's amazing what

113
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,380
they can once and so here is the schools so the question here is please

114
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,270
label one object in this image taken label anything

115
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,820
but no this guy when labelled the vote

116
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,000
everything all the different peoples of the about once and he could have labelled the

117
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,010
four clicks and you will have got his one set

118
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:47,130
you know this guy really doesn't have an eye for business

119
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,670
and this is the only one here is another one

120
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,940
one object all these details one cent

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
of course when we started with say OK maybe this is we are asking only

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,900
for one hundred what we ask for the label as much as you want and

123
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,400
what they will do

124
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,340
well they

125
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,230
still don't they will label like about three four different habitats

126
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,750
and despite the just the all opinion once and so i have push it and

127
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,010
is that

128
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,100
if you think about the, I don't know, amount of mass that its that is in the tail

129
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:31,270
it's so it's so large and the variance here is so large that pretty much everything fails, so what happens with power-laws, right, power-laws are distributions that have infinite expectation, so depending on the slope a power-law distribution can have infinite expectation and infi infini infinite variance

130
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,000
or just infinite variance and so on, so basically

131
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:47,010
from from how to say it, if you look at the moments depending on the on the slope, all the moments from, I don't know, third, fourth, fifth, doesn't matter on will be infinite, so this is why power-laws are

132
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,770
hard distributions to deal with

133
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:57,470
and I I think recently that were some papers on statistical tests for power-laws, but what usually people just like to do, they plot this on log log scales

134
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,620
and they are sort of happy with it and that's not good

135
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,750
or we are not too happy about this or I don't know, how to say, but still

136
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:12,190
evidence that your your distribution has a heavy tail, which would mean that the amount of mass in the tail is

137
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:20,770
is polinomial and not and doesn't decay exponentially, this can easily be seen or distinguished from the exponential distribution when plotted on log log scales

138
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,750
okay and I can point you to the reference, if you'd like for for these things okay

139
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,730
here I just want to show what is the difference between

140
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:35,040
poisson and scale-free network or a network that has a a

141
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,910
power-law degree distribution so, right, this would be a erdos-renyi random graph

142
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,870
so the graph that would be created by the process

143
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,800
I introduced earlier, right, and this is how the degree distribution would look like

144
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,390
so this is the graph

145
00:09:47,400 --> 00:10:08,490
on the same number vertices and everything that has a power-law degree distribution and you can immediately see the difference, right, so here pretty mu every node has about the same degree, right, there is there is a the the distribution of the degree has a mode, here we have these hubs, right this would be the node with the highest degree, then there are a lot of nodes that have just the degree of one

146
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,540
right so this is

147
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,970
and what turns out is that real graphs are more like this and they're not like that

148
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,970
another thing with graphs that you can observe is you can ask, how

149
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:41,430
resilient are they to attacks, right, how how many nodes do I need to remove from the graph, so that the graph falls apart, so the question we are asking is, how does the connectivity of the network change as vertices or edges get removes removed and in the most basic question we can ask two things, we can ask what will happen if the vertices are removed uniformly at random

150
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:46,890
and what if you just sort them by the degree and start degree removing high degree vertices first

151
00:10:48,380 --> 00:11:00,290
and why is this important, it's important, for example for studies of how epidemics happen in the network and how many people do we need to imunize, so so to sort of disconnect the network that the virus couldn't spread all across it

152
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:09,130
and here I'm just showing what happens if we remove the node, right, so by removing these two node our network gets disconnected

153
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,730
and what turns out is that real networks are highly robust to node removal

154
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,590
to explain this two graphs, so here we have the graph of the internet

155
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:25,050
and here we have the average path length and this is the fraction of the nodes we removed

156
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:39,550
the random node removal is the bottom line, so basically it says that average path length doesn't really change, even if we remove half of the nodes or eighty percent of the nodes, the average path length remains the same, while if we go and remove high degree nodes right if remove the hubs

157
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:49,830
then we need to remove very small fraction of them and the network falls apart all the all the mean path length increases a lot, okay, and this is intuitively this makes sense

158
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:57,890
if if our graph is like this, we just remove this guy and we disconnect many many nodes, right, and in a case like that nothing really matters

159
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,030
and here I ha I show

160
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:09,010
the random graph, the one that I had it on the left, so this is again the random node removal and this is high degree node removal, right, and you can see that the the the

161
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,770
average path length increases much slowly

162
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:20,190
okay, so what this means is that real graphs are very resilient to random node removal, but if you would go and, I don't know, knock off

163
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,850
top ten

164
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,490
computers on the internet, the internet would fall apart and we see this every day pretty much

165
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,130
the other thing that is also

166
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:44,030
in the structure of the networks it's called community structure, right, most in the social networks we have this notion of communities that more that similar people are more densily grouped together than they are grouped across commmunities and

167
00:12:44,830 --> 00:13:10,110
he he here would be an example of a friendship network in in some school, right, and here you can see sort of these communities that are more denisily link linked inside that than they are link linked across and there are very different algoritms, how to how to find communities or clusters in the network and you can do spectral clustering, there are methods by newman and et al, but

168
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,840
I I don't want to go into that

169
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:21,970
there are what you can also do is you can study the spectral properties of the graph adjacent symetrics and here I don't, all I want to say is if if you plot

170
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:30,370
so yesterday we talked about basic definitions of convex sets and functions and some

171
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:37,010
we reviewed some applications so in the first lecture today we'll discuss interior

172
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:45,850
methods that are implemented in many of the general-purpose solvers for convex optimization so these solvers

173
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:54,750
usually use a conic optimization format that I've explained first and then we'll discuss two methods two

174
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,910
types of interior point methods for convex optimization in this conic format the first one's the

175
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:06,280
first methods are primal barrier methods and the second one are primal dual methods that are

176
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:16,030
also more symmetric so what's a conic optimization problem so it's a problem with

177
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:23,530
conic inequalities and what that means is the following suppose K is a convex cone

178
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:30,910
and I define an inequality X greater or equal to Y with respect to the cone K

179
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:36,690
and I use this notation just to mean that X minus Y is in a cone

180
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,770
so I use this inequality sign with the subscript K to denote an inequality with

181
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:46,810
respect to that convex cone K  so if K is a non-negative orthant then this simply

182
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,990
means that X is greater or equal to Y component-wise right so X

183
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,790
minus Y is in the non-negative otrhant means X greater or equal to Y component-wise

184
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,510
so it's an extension of component-wise vector inequality to other types of  vector

185
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:09,290
inequalities and I also use this X strictly greater than Y if X minus Y is

186
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:15,190
in the interior of K so here K can be any convex cone there are

187
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:21,590
some  conditions you have to impose to actually you know in order to

188
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:27,210
make sure that these inequalities can be used for example you want the cone to be

189
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:33,390
pointed and a pointed cone means that if a vector X is in the cone minus

190
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,980
X is in a cone then X is zero so a non-pointed cone would be a line

191
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:43,430
a straight line through the origin for example is a non-pointed cone so obviously that's something

192
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,350
you would like to have as a condition K if you want to use these

193
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:55,250
inequality signs otherwise you could have a non zero X that's non-negative and non-positive right you want

194
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:00,930
nonempty interior in a cone in order to be able to use the strict inequalities and

195
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,870
you want it to be closed for example so these are some technical conditions you impose

196
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:10,310
on the cones and a convex cone that satisfies them is called the proper cone

197
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,330
and then we use this inequality sign so yesterday we used this type of inequality

198
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,910
for matrices so X greater or equal to zero with this inequality sign

199
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:24,850
meant X is positive semidefinite here we use it for a general conic inequality we

200
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:31,890
add the subscript K in the inequality if we mean a particular cone K and we omit

201
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:39,840
the subscript if it's just a general generic convex cone right so that's definition of a

202
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:47,350
conic inequality and then a conic linear programming problem is simply defined like this it's defined like

203
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,870
in a standard linear programming problem in inequality form you minimize a linear objective you have

204
00:16:52,870 --> 00:17:00,010
linear inequality constraints but instead of componentwise inequalities we replace this with inequalities respect to

205
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:07,650
a convex cone right so the special case if K is a non-negative orthant

206
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:14,710
is a standard PL but we'll look at several interesting nonpolyhedral convex cones

207
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:20,530
you can use instead so everything else is linear the objective is linear the inequalities are

208
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,490
linear so all the non-linearity  is hidden in the cone really the fact that you

209
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:34,230
use a nonpolyhedral  cone makes this a general a nonlinear convex problem so it's  widely

210
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:43,590
used as a standard form in the recent literature on convex optimization for

211
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,740
a mass was

212
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,320
to give you some rough ideas of

213
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,490
what periods will be

214
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,630
substitutes for l one meter

215
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,610
are you take four g nine point eight that this character

216
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,410
you multiply by two pi

217
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,780
and what you find is

218
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,530
that's the period is about two seconds

219
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,280
the pendulum one meter long

220
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,150
as a period of about two seconds

221
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,450
so to go from here to here is about one second

222
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,240
if i make it four times shorter

223
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,470
l four times shorter describe for is two

224
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,900
then the period

225
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,510
the period is changing four times shorter period must be two times short

226
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,630
make roughly twenty five centimetres

227
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,280
i'm not trying to be very qualitative here not whole period must be about one

228
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,130
six roughly one sec

229
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,340
so you see

230
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,670
that the period is extremely sensitive

231
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,650
two the length of the

232
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,650
i now want to

233
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,340
compare with you the results that we have

234
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,430
for spring

235
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,130
with the results that we have

236
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,050
the pendulum to give you

237
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,410
some further insight

238
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,740
we have the string

239
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,720
and we have the pendulum

240
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,970
and i'm only going to look at the period

241
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,630
here is two pi

242
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,450
divided by the square root

243
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,650
m over k

244
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,360
and here is two pi

245
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,170
times square root of l

246
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,550
over g

247
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,110
if i look here

248
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,990
there's a amassing here

249
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,380
if i look here

250
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,050
independent of the mass

251
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,130
why is the same as in here

252
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,840
that is very easy to see

253
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,630
if i take a spring

254
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,760
and i extend the spring over a certain distance

255
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,510
then there is a certain force

256
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,030
but i feel

257
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,760
that force is independent of the mass of the output at the end of this

258
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,170
the spring doesn't know what the masses you're going to put on all it knows

259
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,950
is i'm too long and i want to go back to a click away

260
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,130
that forces the fixed force if i double the mass

261
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:12,280
that fixed force will give on double the mass half the acceleration if acceleration goes

262
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,650
down the period of oscillation goes up is very clear

263
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,240
so you can immediately see

264
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,720
that was just plain

265
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,680
the vast must enter into the period

266
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,780
now go to the pendulum

267
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,970
if i double the mass of my bob at the end of the pendulum

268
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:33,950
the vertical component of the tension will also double

269
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,030
that means this

270
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,780
restoring force which is proportional was attention goes also double

271
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,970
so now the restoring force doubles

272
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,930
and the math doubles acceleration remains the same the period remains the same

273
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,010
so you can simply argue

274
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,780
there should be no mass you know isn't

275
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,450
about this case

276
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,050
if k is high

277
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,590
the spring is stiff if

278
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,550
what does it mean stiff spring it means that if i give it a small

279
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,990
extension that the spring force is which

280
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,930
you have the spring force

281
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,510
acceleration on a given mass will be high

282
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,990
if i have high acceleration the period will be short

283
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,530
and that's exactly what you see

284
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,760
if k is high

285
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,630
the period will be short

286
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,240
imagine that you have a pendulum in outer space there is no gravity nothing

287
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,450
the pendulum will not swing

288
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,800
the period of the pendulum will be infinitely long

289
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,590
going to the shuttle

290
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,380
with the proceeds gravity in their frame of reference

291
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,300
received their wages remember their perceive gravity is zero

292
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,490
you take pendulum in the shuttle you put at this angle you let it go

293
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,990
it will stay there forever and ever and ever the period is infinitely long

294
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,300
but take a spring in the short

295
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,240
and that the spring oscillate and it does

296
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,130
so you can actually measure the mass of an object

297
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,090
using this brain on the shuttle that oscillate if you know the spring constant and

298
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,200
that's the way it's actually done

299
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,470
yes indeed

300
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,570
that these

301
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,180
on the right-hand side

302
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,840
you plug in the current value

303
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,640
you can't guess he said OK can guess and on the left hand side

304
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,620
part the new value

305
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:24,110
and you stop when the value function stop changing more than a certain amount

306
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,260
so on

307
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,050
and you can sort of arbitrary value function this works

308
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,470
so this is the planning version of policy evaluation when you know the model if

309
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,160
no the model again planning was not going to do exactly the same thing except

310
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,220
for the state action value equations

311
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,220
this is q value iteration same stopping criteria

312
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,520
OK i'm going to be very fast the value function of important things and

313
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,550
the crucial

314
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:57,320
property that makes all of RL value function based RL work is this notion of

315
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,530
contraction which is that when you do iteration

316
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,780
you might start off with the same as in two-dimensional value function space on national

317
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,040
state space the origin that access is true it is

318
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:13,320
is that so that's the labelled the stars the true value

319
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:18,270
the optimal value function you start with an arbitrary guess my point one

320
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,090
and basically at every iteration the maximum the box normal

321
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,530
shrinks by multiplicative factor gamma

322
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,160
so the

323
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:31,150
maximum error cross any state from state the unknown true value function shrinks by multiplicative

324
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:36,200
factor gamma this is the underlying principle lorp

325
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,100
the planning out central to the reinforcement learning algorithms that the TV and q learning

326
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,160
out and everyone

327
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,820
at least heard of problem

328
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,400
that was planning

329
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,080
learning is set to a situation where you don't have a real system you don't

330
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,070
have a model

331
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,120
so you don't have a model but you can play in the real system

332
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,680
and so you can generate experience you can be in some status of zero subscripts

333
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,770
and time we take an action you get towards next state action toward these experience

334
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,040
like this

335
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,570
and his pictorial representation you in some state choice of action to take one action

336
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:13,350
which could lead to a choice of the a distribution on next states you sample

337
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:19,120
one next state choice of action gives particular trajectory like this is what life looks

338
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,200
like we

339
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,090
taking actions we getting this process

340
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,920
so on

341
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:29,350
the two classes methods indirect matters indirect methods what is the indirect method most obvious

342
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,720
thing you can imagine we take experience to estimate the model

343
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,810
here is the simplest

344
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:41,620
nonparametric form of a model estimation just to the empirical estimates of the probability of

345
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,760
seeing state j one x nine state a take current model

346
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,970
find the politics often with respect to it and that's the estimate of the on

347
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,520
policy scholar seventy good policy

348
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,670
it's long get enough data model to converge and the are supposed converge

349
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,300
of course you can use parametric models and much much more things that is this

350
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:07,400
is the flavor of in direct indirect direct chris watkins developed this q learning which

351
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,390
is exactly the same

352
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,400
recursive form that you've seen before except of course you can't take expectations so you

353
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,480
just take the

354
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:22,750
the part that i to point part that the square brackets without front is the

355
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:27,260
sample of the recursive formula the recursion iteration you would do

356
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,560
so the actual what you get a discount best value of the actual state again

357
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,490
because you get a noisy estimate you don't

358
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:37,340
move fully to the new estimate you mix it with your list

359
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,620
that's collected

360
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,450
in and

361
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,310
basically it's a noisy a noisy contraction

362
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,150
stochastic approximation theory works and that's the result that q learning convert property one

363
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,220
so much more

364
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,690
so so far i tell you what an MDP definition is what the planning and

365
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,190
learning algorithms are

366
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,180
four for policy evaluation optimal control

367
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:07,570
i was the first to learning i thought i'd say this because chris is here

368
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,830
the first provably convergent adaptive control system and then made a huge

369
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:20,740
huge social logical and practical impact in in reinforcement learning

370
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,730
this sometimes works stochastic sometimes work something does

371
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,380
OK so why aren't we done

372
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,100
well part of it is have until you sold exploration exploitation problem and that is

373
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,100
how do we actually the q learning to learn the value function then tell you

374
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,650
how to behave

375
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,610
now you you've got the optimal q value function then you are ahead but you

376
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,430
don't know how do you how do we hear why learning OK well one answers

377
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,950
epsilon really just

378
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,830
some small property explore

379
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:52,990
now exploit and you can provide conditions under which is

380
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:58,540
and we have the other really interesting class of ideas which i'll just say one

381
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,900
sentence but there are tons of papers that soldier field here

382
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,320
it's called the idea of optimism under uncertainty

383
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,100
this beautiful work has been done

384
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:12,260
in the exploration exploitation problem with the following idea

385
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,920
whenever you uncertain about something

386
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,890
about transition probability somewhere

387
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,360
four songs or you value functions

388
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,940
more optimism then maybe towards

389
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,110
c pretend things you don't know

390
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,220
that the things you know

391
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,950
and that leads but of course if you keep doing that then you forever

392
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,870
explore and that's not good so that the amount of optimism has to go down

393
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,130
over time

394
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:46,540
so shrinking optimism under uncertainty shrinking in time optimism under uncertainty is a class of

395
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,250
ideas starting from

396
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:55,640
exploration bonus work the today and the the first sort of the really

397
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,540
i did this right and then a whole bunch of algorithms that have been are

398
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,680
being produced even today

399
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:09,220
exploits idea optimism optimism under uncertainty and it gets really nice strong results

400
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,010
polynomial time results

401
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,040
for optimism under uncertainty so if you if you if you find this topic interesting

402
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,970
to lots of things to read about

403
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:22,010
and finally i'm just again only one sentence there's bayesian class of methods where

404
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,670
you're doing

405
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,150
planning if you like

406
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,760
in the state of knowledge rather than physical state

407
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:33,470
and if you plan state of knowledge you can make you can optimally solve the

408
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:37,990
exploration exploitation problem i would say much more about that so that's

409
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,810
that's so that solutions to exploration exploitation

410
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,550
so now again what what's already done we can we do can we solve the

411
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,840
problem of building a second live in the real world

412
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,100
it really is stochastic

413
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,980
of course not because all the things that only about more or less fall for

414
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:03,420
but that of course is not practical so how do we deal with

415
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,560
scaling and again this is the last bit of on the table and then one

416
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,800
of the more interesting parts are very quickly that you've never or not been exposed

417
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:17,140
to enforce community maybe forty percent if you didn't raise your hand something like that

418
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,950
i give you a quick tour

419
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,020
of these ideas

420
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,730
so the function approximation ideas the most obvious ones instead of storing things in the

421
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,210
lookup table distorting the function approximation can favor function approximator

422
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,980
backprop electrical basis functions c-max nearest neighbour decision trees whatever

423
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,210
just replace

424
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:41,060
indexing things into a table with a parametric or whatever the parametric form is linear

425
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:45,050
and very partial linear but then the only idea of course

426
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:49,030
so there are other extensions of gas in processes

427
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,510
there are

428
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,670
the couple i can talk about

429
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,150
in this slide are two

430
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:56,950
and then

431
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,420
o i

432
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,700
i could say a couple words about there's a process mixtures people are interested

433
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,950
this is a fruitful area i mean there are lots of things you can do

434
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,950
if you if you wanted to nonparametric bayesian things you're forced into coming up with

435
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,420
new ideas because

436
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:18,010
you know you never satisfied with how flexible your car model is

437
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,570
cholera snow's and i were not very satisfied with gas processes

438
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,880
a few years ago

439
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,900
just the ordinary gasoline prices because

440
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,570
it is difficult to specify really flexible covariance functions so

441
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,360
you want you might have data where the function has varying spatial frequency like here

442
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,550
it's more weakly here unless we hear you might have varying signal amplitude here it's

443
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,780
more it's less you have varying noise level

444
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:55,280
like more noise here last night here and this sort of stationary covariance functions don't

445
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,970
handle that very well

446
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,840
another problem with gas processes is the prediction in training requires

447
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:09,170
finding an inverse of this covariance matrix which to be exact is order and q

448
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,740
of the we can try to approximate it so

449
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:15,530
both of these things can be fixed to some extent

450
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,880
applying is sort of divide and conquer strategy

451
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,630
so what we're going to do

452
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,920
divide of the input space into different regions and have different gases processes for these

453
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,320
different parts of the input space

454
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,650
this is an idea very similar to an old idea called mixture of experts

455
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:38,070
except we're not going to divide it up reorient to these regions really let the

456
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,920
learning algorithm to find the reason regions on its own

457
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:46,470
and the other thing we wanted to do is we don't want to restrict

458
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:52,360
priority how many regions there were we don't want to say find me five regions

459
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,510
it turns out using some tricks

460
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,650
from the sun to talk about

461
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,740
for a couple minutes in the second half

462
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,840
we can actually remove that restriction we can just say

463
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,780
there are countably infinite number of regions

464
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,970
you don't have to have a finite number of regions

465
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,220
but don't worry about that sort of

466
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,110
the trick which makes it even more nonparametric

467
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,920
and the basic idea is that you can have different covariance functions in different parts

468
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,780
of the space

469
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,700
and once you do that you can handle all of these kinds of things

470
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:30,650
another property of this is that by dividing up the space you're also dividing the

471
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:36,090
the dataset into the datapoints belonging to one gaussianprocess versus another casting process was another

472
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:40,280
casting process so instead of doing one big order and q

473
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:46,190
matrix inversion you can split up the order and q to be into smaller

474
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,150
matrix inverses for each

475
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,320
o thing so

476
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,760
for any particular partitioning of the data

477
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,110
this divide and conquer policy

478
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,930
is faster but you have to do inference over all possible

479
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,450
it is also

480
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:05,260
my model

481
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,700
multimodality in this space there are some reasons why this prior functions is not so

482
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,820
nice because

483
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,800
you have to put in sufficient to the function

484
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,260
in this region has to match with the function in this region you can spin

485
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,330
it to make some positive by saying you've multimodality or you can make it sound

486
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,950
negative by saying you have a weird function that can jump from this is that

487
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,740
part of this part

488
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:32,690
i don't know depends on your application whether that's a good thing

489
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,490
the last sort of thing the last kind of snapshot i want to give is

490
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:45,110
that you can do that you can learn the kernel parameters using

491
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:49,490
a combination of e and this EP algorithm

492
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,010
which i know could tell you about how these you're interested in

493
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:59,320
and this is the nice property that that you get policies have is that you

494
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,450
can learn the kernel from data

495
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,530
and the way you do that is just you think

496
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,090
we tried to get process latent variable models you think of the

497
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,590
function values is being hidden and then you have an algorithm if you're familiar with

498
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,690
that and when you want to infer the latent function values in your e step

499
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,720
you do some sort of inference like this EP

500
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,340
which are not going to talk about now this work is really

501
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:31,690
much inspired by work by over winter healthsouth income here seeger

502
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,490
so some of these guys are here in the room

503
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:41,220
let me conclude about casting processes

504
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,030
their general framework for nonparametric function approximation

505
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,260
and they can be extended in several ways

506
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,220
an old one is classification

507
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:54,300
there are other ones like one regression ordinal regression in mixture of casting process experts

508
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:58,990
it is straightforward to infer the kernel from data using bayesian methods and CMC in

509
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,840
the past so MEP algorithm

510
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,780
i have about

511
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,070
zero minutes maybe

512
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,320
i sort of predicted this

513
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,550
that's why this

514
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,990
how think

515
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,990
i think this is just passes

516
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,880
let me just take

517
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,780
you know

518
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,200
half of my remaining time

519
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,570
and just tell you

520
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:32,490
a couple words about a different thing that's nonparametric and bayesian OK to say don't

521
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,800
think it's all only gas processes

522
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,220
don't look at any equations

523
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,990
OK that'll make it faster

524
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,590
everybody probably knows what gas the mixture model is

525
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:51,930
now usually in a gas mixture model you have to decide on some finite number

526
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,490
of components k and you find the maximum likelihood settings of these parameters using the

527
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,150
EM algorithm

528
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,490
a dirichlet process mixture

529
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:04,900
or in particular dirichlet process mixture of gaussians

530
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,300
is a beautiful trick for

531
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,920
so rather than having a finite number of components you can have countably infinite number

532
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,490
so that sort of in doing elimination in the usual forward way i get to

533
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,400
i'm going put glasses on so that i can

534
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:31,370
capture this fantastic problem right

535
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,750
so this is

536
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,770
in the forward direction all indicate those by plus

537
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:43,630
the standard eliminating forward now i don't know if you ever gave any thought to

538
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,680
the possibility of doing the elimination

539
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,910
starting at the bottom row and working upward

540
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,760
the viewer was no reason we couldn't do that

541
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,970
in that order from one to n isn't

542
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,540
the only possibility

543
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:05,130
what what what will happen if i do elimination upwards

544
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,010
and we just pretend have matrix here

545
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,860
what do i do then

546
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,270
i've taken multiple of that row

547
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,650
subtract from the row above

548
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,410
to produce zero there

549
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,920
then i got something new than that from the robot

550
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,810
now what kind of factors one of my one of my guess my original he

551
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,500
was tried diagonal

552
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,410
i'm coming from

553
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,650
upward direction

554
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,090
and one of my reaching

555
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,870
reaching in l

556
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,080
so the region you are reaching l

557
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,650
the factorizations

558
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,630
in the opposite direction would be a u

559
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,330
finds the

560
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,390
times and

561
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,180
and i just have to give those

562
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,300
those that l is different from the other l

563
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:55,020
and that's like the reverse

564
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,270
the reverse LDU OK

565
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,950
and that's the

566
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,410
so that's coming up now here's the fantastic four no

567
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,210
we're interested in

568
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,520
are inverse

569
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,390
the inverse

570
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:15,290
the entries on the diagonal of the inverse

571
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:18,510
that's what all this stuff is going to be about

572
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,180
OK and here's the formula for

573
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,410
that it's

574
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:31,000
the plus it's the diagonal entry of the plus

575
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,820
and the diagonal entries of d minus

576
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:40,890
minus the diagonal entry of t

577
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,620
well i call that night

578
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,440
and the need for

579
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,400
and but i don't call

580
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,870
only answers that i've seen to this question which i don't have with i don't

581
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,220
know the answers with

582
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,570
i don't call them

583
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,600
and i feel that if i really

584
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,950
if i were kalman

585
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:07,800
i could

586
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,150
i'd say oh yeah that's that

587
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,330
that's the formula

588
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,740
and of course i guess i believe that if this

589
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,850
four is true which i think it is

590
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,250
that would

591
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,490
generalized to blocks

592
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,850
let me take one released like

593
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,650
special case of this formula

594
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:39,820
suppose let's look at what common is most important looking at the let the n

595
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,310
k equal and

596
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,350
that n by n block of

597
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,660
the last

598
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,600
so what's the

599
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,830
what do i get when k is an

600
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:55,670
when i went there so the point is this is true for all the middle

601
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,210
between one and

602
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:04,000
but i we conceive quickly why it's true it and similarly quickly why it's true

603
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,190
so i'm just hoping you might

604
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,560
like realizes like press

605
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,330
all right let me take a to be and

606
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,390
what is the

607
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:23,270
what is the minus and and

608
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:26,310
it's the diagonal entry c

609
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:35,750
end we know there was any time admissible mess things up we do that this

610
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,350
is rho n

611
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:43,480
what i'm saying is that that is the same as that

612
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,670
i matrix t

613
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,460
with and and guy in the corner

614
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:53,460
and when i do elimination of words still there never

615
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,850
never got to call the alterations

616
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,190
happened upwards

617
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,920
if if k is an

618
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,440
and this is just saying that members the and an entry three

619
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,920
it's the same as

620
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,850
the end entry

621
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,060
of the

622
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:15,620
and that's all i want to say is that special case is clear

623
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,230
that is if i'm looking at k ghulam and that's the same as that

624
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,330
it's just the regular

625
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,910
last inverse

626
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,250
and that's what calman has to be computed

627
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,250
his colonies

628
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,560
in this

629
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,810
in this part before it does any smoothing he's going for the and and the

630
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,580
most recent one

631
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:45,580
and that's this is the quantity we want and it's the block here so

632
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,330
cameron has to do elimination

633
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,940
on this

634
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,910
on this

635
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,020
on this matrix

636
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,190
so that's a comment whether with the question of repeatedly

637
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:02,390
and the notes

638
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,590
i guess you and i should feel that if we don't find the answer because

639
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,480
a lot of other people didn't find but then

640
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,620
it would be nice to do it in nice to do an interesting way

641
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,290
all the possibility that out of

642
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:17,040
out of our own

643
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,170
work on something

644
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,250
it's of interest outside too

645
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:33,140
well one of my going to do with common

646
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:37,400
when i write down some of those formulas so we got five things then the

647
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,580
new you

648
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:44,750
there is more damping here damping force here let's see can really talk that way

649
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:49,040
since the units of different but does this number is bigger than that 1

650
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:57,340
it seems clear at any rate OK now what's the characteristic equation look now watch

651
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,500
please do what I do or even by I found in the past even by

652
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,400
the middle of the terms but there are still students who feel that they must

653
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,600
substitute y equals e to the RT and go through that whole little derivation defined

654
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,400
and you don't do that it's a waste of time I did it that you

655
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,900
might not ever have to do it again OK

656
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:27,390
immediately right down the characteristic equation that's not very or squared plus 4 more or

657
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,880
less 3 equals 0

658
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,340
and you can write down its roots immediately splendid but let's not assume that level

659
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:42,100
of competence or so it's ah + 3 times or plus 1

660
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:44,620
equals 0

661
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:48,880
OK factor all of this being 18

662
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,890
0 3 alot of the times the routes will be integers when they're not God

663
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:59,360
forbid you use the quadratic formula OK but here the rotor integers is after all

664
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:06,840
in the 1st example so the solution the general solution is y equals c one

665
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:12,780
e to the negative notice the root is minus 3 and minus 1 minus 3

666
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,340
T plus the 2

667
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,390
In e to the negative

668
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:22,380
now suppose you its initial value problem so I gave you initial conditions both the

669
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,860
initial conditions where that's why 0 or 1

670
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:31,890
so at the start of the mass masses been moved over to the position 1

671
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,300
here will we expected them to

672
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:42,230
start doing that but this is fairly heavily damped this is heavily damped I'm going

673
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:46,490
to assume that the mass starts at rest so as in the standard the spring

674
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:51,860
is the standard masses over here but there is no motion at time 0 this

675
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:56,190
way or that way in other words I'm not pushing it on just releasing it

676
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:01,120
and letting it do its thing after that OK so why prime of zero all

677
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,250
assume is 0

678
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:08,120
so it starts at rest but in the extended position

679
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:11,350
1 unit to the right in front of the equilibrium position

680
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,780
now all you have to do is

681
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:20,320
use these 2 conditions notice I have 2 conditions because there are 2 constants I

682
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,250
have to find the value of

683
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,210
alright so

684
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,640
let substituted

685
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:31,410
quality we're going to have to calculate the derivatives so when we do that right

686
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:36,170
away so this is minus 3 C 1 you minus 3 T

687
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:41,800
of minus C 2 the to the negative

688
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:45,620
and now by substituting at 0 0

689
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,560
when t equals 0

690
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:55,380
for get will 1st equation the left says the y of 0 should be 1

691
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,970
and the right says this is the 1 that's 1 so it's c 1 +

692
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,950
C 2 as the result of substituting t equals 0

693
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,110
all about substituting which I substitute in the 2nd equation well why prime 0 0

694
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:15,020
0 0 so the 2nd equation when I put into equals 0 let's solid is

695
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:21,540
0 according to that initial value and the right side is negative 3 C 1

696
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,630
make minus

697
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:31,440
you see would you end up with therefore force a pair of simultaneous linear equations

698
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:36,500
and this is why you learn to study linear search pairs of simultaneous linear equations

699
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,060
in high school

700
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,780
these are among the most important

701
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:48,080
solving problems of this type are among the most important applications that kind of algebra

702
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,390
and this kind of algebra

703
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,780
right what's the answer finally well if I add the 2 of them I get

704
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,150
minus 2 C 1

705
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,390
equals 1 so

706
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,170
C 1 is equal to

707
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,930
minus 1 half

708
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:13,420
and 1 is minus higher than C 2 is minus 3 C 1 so it

709
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:17,380
it's C 2 is 3 halves

710
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:30,690
the final question is what is that look like as a solution while in general

711
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:36,390
these combinations of 2 exponentials on very easy to plot by yourself 0 that's 1

712
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:40,410
of the reasons you are being given this little visual which plots them for you

713
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:44,060
all you have to do is as you'll see set the damping constant set the

714
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:49,670
constants set the initial conditions if by magic the curve appears on the screen and

715
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:54,560
if you change the either the either the constants the curve will change nicely right

716
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:00,120
along with it

717
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:07,340
so solution is

718
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,520
the solution is

719
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:17,430
y equals minus one half

720
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:21,200
and if you make each guest kind of independently you know if you're ninety percent

721
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,280
accurate each step of the way are basically guaranteed to be run by the time

722
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,130
you done so

723
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,240
one of the park's real accomplishments was finding way too

724
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,430
pac only get together and avoid resolving it until you have more information in the

725
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:37,380
pipeline that took a very long time to actually work not just through the sort

726
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,320
of shallow levels of syntax but all the way through the semantic processing pipeline that

727
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:46,360
was really big accomplishment another big accomplishment was only done kind of in the last

728
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,800
seven years which was integrated statistics into the whole system

729
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:56,220
before that there there was no knowledge to prefer one partial interpretation of the others

730
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:01,110
and then there was the amount of work done integrating the school methods with the

731
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,590
with the sort of the pure linguistic methods

732
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:09,610
so that's one set of things the other set was really around more slots

733
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,260
OK that the computing resources didn't just didn't exist so

734
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,820
when when powerset came start working with park

735
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:20,570
they were very excited because they had this sort of seven hundred sentences that they

736
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:25,760
OK and those things could take a long time and now

737
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,180
it's not

738
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,470
i really do before

739
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:36,070
so i like to say that computing resources five years ago

740
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:39,010
if you're thinking about passing the whole web and went past the hole and yet

741
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:44,010
we're starting with millions of documents getting our algorithms down there and then scaling but

742
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:47,860
five years from now five five years ago no amount of computing the whole planet

743
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,910
could do this

744
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:50,550
and five years from now

745
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,860
it's going to look relatively cheap

746
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:56,470
and you know right now is interesting time where things are converging so

747
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:02,010
i guess that this shore short answer is that the technology actually kind of got

748
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,610
to a point where the team themselves like can be commercially viable which was not

749
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:11,870
the case for thirty years the available to community resources like wordnet available to web

750
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:17,510
scale data as you could use statistics on it and large amount of computing resources

751
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:22,320
have all kind of converge to make these things possible to extend we're doing now

752
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,660
that were not possible earlier

753
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:32,740
and i think the question was other advantages to asking structured queries as opposed to

754
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:37,800
natural language queries

755
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:44,240
so yes if you could just let people access structured queries they it of course

756
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,530
it's actually

757
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:50,030
much better from a systems perspective because it doesn't have to risk getting wrong interpretation

758
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,390
of the user's query

759
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:55,680
so we actually have a system

760
00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:02,240
maybe i'll even show it here

761
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,550
OK so

762
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:10,590
here's a much deeper system that we have for development which generates the query execution

763
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,110
like that

764
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:21,370
and then goes down and takes the graphical structures and ultimately has scoring and everything

765
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:25,240
like that and that when we play with this

766
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,490
we were able to do a really great things by working correctly and that kind

767
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:33,510
of query language and so so yes you could do really great things the challenge

768
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:36,680
there is will users actually will consumers actually do it

769
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,760
that that's your question but certainly can do really great things by doing structured queries

770
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,570
the system

771
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:48,220
so let's see the first question was about

772
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,970
and do we have statistics on how well our system performs

773
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,070
and various other task so

774
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:58,640
the basic answer is yes

775
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,030
we do internally we measure

776
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:03,860
accuracy at the semantic role level

777
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:07,050
accuracy of sort of named entity extraction recognition

778
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:12,700
so any step of the pipeline we to measure accuracy and then the at the

779
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,390
higher level we measure overall search relevance so

780
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,760
given the query

781
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,950
take all the results to come back and we have human you know people

782
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:23,870
actually going to evaluate the result quality

783
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,450
so we can compute metrics compare ourselves to other kinds of search techniques and so

784
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,410
on that the overall system level

785
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:35,180
there are interesting things which is which are that the improvement in a given component

786
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:40,070
may or may not actually making improvement at the overall level of perceived relevance by

787
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:44,780
users and other than that i mean there's some components and these things work in

788
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:49,280
progress i don't have specific things about the exact specific accuracy

789
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,090
the second question is about our business model

790
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:58,510
however small is really two two parts one is direct-to-consumer so

791
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:02,010
like other search engines have a search engine users can come

792
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:05,240
and use and make money of advertising so

793
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,590
users can you know users can use that advertisers can say the kind of users

794
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:16,010
they like to reach basically connect then were also interested in licensing our technology to

795
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:20,240
other people who are who have large set content to make their own search better

796
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,890
or to the large search engines to help them you know make some of the

797
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:26,390
queries better touch language

798
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,840
as you saw this these kinds of examples

799
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,390
you know

800
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,090
with with power mouse

801
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,360
being able to go on group of these kinds of entities well then you can

802
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:41,530
go and say OK well we already if we know the dinosaurs that analysis sources

803
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,780
of dinosaur we know what our sources have

804
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:48,110
and we know that you know what think will probably dinosaurs have and what properties

805
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:52,910
in reptiles have then you can really make some very interesting much cleaner ontologies can

806
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:58,800
be used by other systems really we haven't done working that yet we're excited to

807
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:02,470
and certainly will be interested to collaborate with people and we will be planning to

808
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:05,570
put out an API so that people can go and take these things and no

809
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:09,070
doubt about the raw data and going going user more

810
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:13,200
OK so the question is with respect your interaction freebase

811
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,740
how exactly a little bit more detail about how that works because clearly freemasons has

812
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,680
its own terminology

813
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,010
and then there's wordnet and how those things actually go together work and then how

814
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:26,550
that applies to sort out and more different things

815
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:31,200
so i think the first thing is that as we all know these kind of

816
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,360
problems are hard

817
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:33,630
and so

818
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,430
you know i don't i don't know the powerset has better answers on that and

819
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:40,700
then a lot of people here in and in the community in fact we look

820
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:46,680
to this work to help make these kind of ontology mapping integration better one specific

821
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,910
interesting challenges out freebase

822
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:52,860
some pretty cool things it's going on outside vision as well

823
00:54:54,910 --> 00:55:00,240
quick outline here we don't have time to time to go through a sort of machine learning refresher crash course

824
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:00,820
just kind of

825
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:05,030
sort of refresher if you take machine learning class but it's been a while or

826
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,720
you have taken machine learning class maybe been through like intro

827
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:08,740
ai something

828
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,160
sort of the sense for how machine learning is done how it works

829
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:16,100
and then we're going to go through sort of natural extension of that

830
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:18,000
to supervised deep learning

831
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:18,710
and sort of

832
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,380
give you

833
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:24,550
so tools for actually training deep neural network so the basic algorithms used there

834
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,260
and then also

835
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:31,030
tell you a bit about what the application specific things we want to use for computer vision or

836
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,320
if you want to use neural networks for vision problems

837
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:36,000
turns out you need some extra ingredients to with those are

838
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,640
also a bit about debugging

839
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,590
i'm just a couple slides on that

840
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:45,640
and then i'll go back to what maybe story more familiar to some of you who've been

841
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,130
watching deep learning for a while

842
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,090
which is about unsupervised deep learning

843
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:53,040
involves using unsupervised algorithms where we don't have label data

844
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,070
for trying to train deep networks

845
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:59,760
and then at the very end we have some references resources are for you guys to pick

846
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,060
on the web

847
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,770
including link to tutorial that you can do online later

848
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,090
in supervised learning

849
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:11,210
sort of a common mode that we want to operate an

850
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,230
we're we're going to be given a whole bunch of training examples

851
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:19,130
and our training examples all have label associated with them

852
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:23,100
that usually given to us by human some kind of system with a lot of knowledge it

853
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:26,830
basically we have a whole bunch of pairs

854
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:30,720
so the first element of this pair is vector x

855
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:34,160
and this is essentially our input data it's the thing that we're given

856
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,560
and then we have some output y which is the vac variable that we want to predict

857
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:42,210
and why could be a vector could be a whole bunch of continuous quantities are might

858
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:43,010
be discrete

859
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:44,540
so for example

860
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:48,660
or in the case we've been talking about someone as an image and i would like to

861
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:50,150
is cat

862
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,120
we could represent cat as a vector of

863
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,530
pixel intensities

864
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,090
and then we're going to

865
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,690
pass through some function i'm just going to call f of x here

866
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,280
and they were asked to predict the discrete

867
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,900
binary label either zero if it's not a cat

868
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,520
or one if it is cat

869
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:09,300
and the question for machine learning

870
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,540
for supervised learning algorithm is

871
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:18,110
to try to find some f of x so that it correctly predicts the label y

872
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,690
on all of our training examples of whatever i put x sin correctly says as cat

873
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:26,710
or not cat for all the examples are as many examples as possible

874
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,730
in the training set that we've been given

875
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:31,120
and hopefully if all goes well

876
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:34,860
this learned predictor is going to work on some test data so if i give you an

877
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,170
image you've never seen before

878
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,120
you actually get the correct prediction out of it

879
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:44,950
so one review very simple binary classification algorithm so

880
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,360
if you want to actually solve this problem

881
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:49,470
one thing that you could try doing

882
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,700
is to start from a function has this form so

883
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,170
it's f acts and then this will semi-colon here just means that

884
00:57:56,330 --> 00:58:01,370
the variables to the right are sort of parameters but you can just think of x and theta here has been

885
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,550
to inputs to f

886
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:09,130
and f of x is going to have this definition words one over one plus acts of minus

887
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:12,160
the inner product or dot product of of data indexed

888
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,870
so this linear function here

889
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,600
is really to i'm

890
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,440
going to try to give positive values

891
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:25,570
to things that are cats and is going to try to give negative values to things not cats and

892
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:30,600
this nonlinear function that sort of wrapped around it which i'm label sigma everywhere

893
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:35,080
is a sigmoid function you can just think of it as a squashing function which is going to take this

894
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:39,450
otherwise linear value and scrunched down so it fits

895
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,430
into the range between zero and one

896
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:45,280
and the reason we want to do that and so that we can interpret the output

897
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:47,850
of this function f acts as a probability

898
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,020
so our goal is to try to train

899
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,680
this f of x function

900
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:57,860
to tell us the probability that same picture in this image represented by acts

901
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:59,040
is actually kept

902
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,710
so we want to be large

903
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:05,770
when y is equal to one meaning it's cat and we want to be small y equals zero

904
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:06,770
meaning it's not cat

905
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:12,000
and to do that not going to go through exactly where this function comes from

906
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:14,690
but this is an objective function that we want to minimize

907
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:16,560
so basically

908
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,070
what we want to do here

909
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:23,680
is this cost function or loss function as a function of theta

910
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,900
tells us how well our function f fits our training data so i'm going to do

911
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,810
a sum over all the examples

912
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,970
and whatever the label is one

913
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,780
i want to basically make

914
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:37,610
this value here large

915
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:39,910
which is actually the probability why is one

916
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,800
and whatever labels says that zero i want to make this probability very small

917
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,920
so if we find

918
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,440
that the data that minimizes this that's also going to be the one

919
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:51,760
that makes good predictions on our training set

920
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:56,550
so how we actually tunes data to minimize this thing

921
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:03,770
one algorithm that we can actually used to do this and fact there are lots of algorithms we could choose

922
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:06,250
but almost all share the same basic approach

923
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,700
which is that we need to compute the gradient

924
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:09,990
of this loss function

925
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:13,920
and this is something you can do by hand for logistic regression if you just go

926
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:16,990
pull your calculus book compute a bunch of derivatives

927
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,510
then you find that the gradient looks like this

928
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:26,260
you can pass this to some off the-shelf optimizer if you want

929
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:31,220
or you can just implement your own gradient descent algorithm where we do is we pick

930
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:34,370
some initial guess for data that could just be random values

931
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,270
and then we're going to do is every time

932
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:40,240
we want to make up date we compute this gradient

933
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:45,420
and then we make a small change to data points in the negative direction so remember that the gradient

934
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:50,230
is pointing in the uphill direction so if i change data in the opposite direction go down el

935
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,420
so this is a very simple optimization algorithm

936
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,570
i'm going to return to this with ways to make a much better

937
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:57,800
when we talk about

938
01:00:58,010 --> 01:00:58,590
deep learning

939
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,680
and finally i'm sort of

940
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:06,820
technical difference and when we actually implement this is what we have a lot of data

941
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:12,760
we don't sum over the whole dataset we just take a few examples maybe one example one hundred examples

942
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,610
and compute the gradient from those

943
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:15,880
before we make an update

944
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,680
that way we can make lots of updates very quickly and hopefully make more progress

945
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:24,250
so it turns out this is pretty nice

946
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:27,910
function that i showed you that we want to minimize is convex

947
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:33,350
so that very simple optimizer i showed you was always going to take you to some nice minimum one you set

948
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,070
step size properly

949
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:40,990
and this works for simple problems so if i give you these digits zeros and ones

950
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,570
and to give you the labels that tells you whether there's zero or one it turns out

951
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:46,460
this this classifier work great

952
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,730
but the reason that works

953
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:53,130
is because there's some pixels in these things turn out to be very highly informative

954
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,360
so for example the pixel in the center

955
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,060
usually tell whether it's zero or one

956
01:01:58,350 --> 01:02:00,070
because the zeros in the whole

957
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,620
and one it's it's turned on

958
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:06,050
so it turns out that linear function works pretty well

959
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,650
but if i give you something more complex

960
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:11,900
that you know to our eyes these very simple

961
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,270
this algorithm will fail completely

962
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:17,770
so for example if i ask you or is this a coffee mug

963
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:18,790
or you have

964
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:22,090
very little hope you can take my word for because this is a problem that i've

965
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:23,880
played with for quite it for quite a while

966
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,530
to related problem

967
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:28,590
if you want to compute

968
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:32,200
i can functions of integral operators there again

969
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:36,870
computing eigen vectors you can do it you can solve differential equations in integral form

970
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:42,300
so if you have a good integration method you can compute the standing waves

971
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:45,140
alpha particle in a box around the optimal

972
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:46,430
and you can you know

973
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,790
lasers and all these quantum things

974
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:54,920
they can also study the physical properties of objects statistical properties

975
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,780
materials and so on

976
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:01,840
and basically think that last but there is

977
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:11,090
it's all about monte carlo in this setting is all about counting lot very quickly

978
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:14,710
here's an example of how you can use the full simulation this comes from a

979
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:19,170
graph paper of the journey and foresight

980
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:25,010
if i can get this to right

981
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:40,270
the got that have

982
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,330
sorry about the formatting of difficulty with this

983
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:51,100
just by

984
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,060
this is a monte carlo simulation of dice

985
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:58,610
you know like the casino

986
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:07,530
and yes some people really love things that they did is to try to make

987
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:10,280
things that are realistic look realistic

988
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:13,300
that looks like three or by computer program

989
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:17,090
but at the same time you have full control the thing

990
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:20,080
so in particular if your servant

991
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:25,940
the one goes to one of the two will go to it two

992
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,860
the three will go to three

993
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:28,800
and so on

994
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:33,410
so it's like if you designing computer games you want to create realistic settings

995
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:36,880
and you want to at the same time have control of these

996
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:40,450
you know some people in the graphics literature have been doing this

997
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,080
there's quite a few more examples

998
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:46,110
just showing one

999
01:04:46,680 --> 01:05:00,640
we're going to be more interested with using monte carlo to the machine learning is

1000
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,990
this machine learning summer school

1001
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:08,560
and so the idea is you know we were trying to come up with

1002
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,010
some sort of model

1003
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,760
of the world

1004
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:17,010
i'm using attacked to describe the world of forces

1005
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:23,090
and we would like to do something is good this so

1006
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:27,100
let me give you now for another cookie

1007
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,900
you go is another

1008
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:33,890
there's a bunch of things here

1009
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:38,290
and i have highlighted three of the two class

1010
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:39,860
i one to here

1011
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,280
another one here

1012
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,670
and this is the third to

1013
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:46,820
so for of cooking

1014
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:50,300
OK to asked this question

1015
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:54,220
you think side

1016
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,870
the arguments less

1017
01:05:56,630 --> 01:06:00,250
that's a good question

1018
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,540
will come back to that

1019
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:08,590
can someone tell me let's indexed this will be rolled the columns of this is

1020
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,700
two one

1021
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,960
three one to three two

1022
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:12,790
in one

1023
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:15,390
o point out where there's true for

1024
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:20,750
three four

1025
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,500
this guy

1026
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:27,750
how many people agree that this is the two four

1027
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,180
i mean it people think it's not too far

1028
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:35,600
OK so whoever that cannot get the cooking

1029
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,420
OK another one

1030
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,860
i would say many people agree

1031
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,360
the great

1032
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,650
how about

1033
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:53,800
let me make one might and i

1034
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:57,990
this guy how many people think that i think this goes through

1035
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,070
if people think it

1036
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:05,510
this is how much freight company

1037
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,860
two thing is that you have

1038
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,700
what about the two forward like a baby to for growing and

1039
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:16,390
OK so that the

1040
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:20,930
but it was later quite a few people chose not to vote

1041
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,630
i have no clue what to do about it

1042
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,360
all i know is i can take a bunch of tricks symbols i can tell

1043
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,170
you what are two first

1044
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,020
and very quickly in

1045
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:32,930
there is

1046
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:36,420
you actually made a pretty strong opinions of what to was

1047
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:37,920
and what was not

1048
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:39,190
and sometimes

1049
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,280
and also was subjective system

1050
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,430
didn't take on the same features

1051
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:49,190
this kind of very fast learning very kind of strike action is

1052
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:52,320
what we would like to build a given day to be able to do this

1053
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,520
and actions

1054
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,620
what justin bangles them the induction leads

1055
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,260
we very quickly learn

1056
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:03,150
what something is

1057
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:08,030
so using bayes rule so the idea is want to learn this given the data

1058
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:13,160
we want to learn this hypothesis and bayes rule provides us with the mechanism for

1059
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:17,770
that as long as we have a prior model of the hypothesis and we have

1060
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:22,080
the data and this is the sort of simulation ideas for my class

1061
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,780
the sheep

1062
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:29,310
you know a child might have a distribution indicating

1063
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,310
you know according to the height of this

1064
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:35,100
how likely something is to be a shape

1065
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:38,390
and so there's a few goats there because god kind of

1066
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,110
cookies have arrived

1067
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:48,880
others can i mean the

1068
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:57,150
the guides were asking the question then let's look

1069
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,690
all come into play

1070
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,270
by the time

1071
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:07,180
OK it'll come to me but said

1072
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,620
I'm going to leave this example

1073
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:22,070
to finish OK and the beauty of the of the sliding boards

1074
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:26,370
I can make it go away and cannot

1075
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:31,050
let me let me not doing yeah let me

1076
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:32,480
take a 2nd example

1077
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:40,770
me take a 2nd example where the matrix is singular

1078
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:42,960
so rank 1

1079
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:49,090
OK so let me take as an example to

1080
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:57,570
where are my matrix a is going to be a rectangular again

1081
01:09:57,590 --> 01:10:01,380
let me make that may just make it for 3

1082
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:09,740
OK that's a rank one matrix

1083
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:12,220
so that the null space

1084
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:16,110
and only a one-dimensional

1085
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:22,870
rose space and column space so actually that that might buy picture it becomes easy

1086
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:24,680
for this matrix

1087
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:29,960
because what's my columns of my rose space for this 1 so this is 2

1088
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,370
by 2

1089
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:35,660
so my my pictures of both two-dimensional my

1090
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:41,270
my rose space is all multiples of that vector for 3

1091
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:46,310
so that all the row space is just a line right

1092
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:52,240
that's the row space and the null space of course is the perpendicular so the

1093
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,110
row space

1094
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:59,370
for this matrix is multiple

1095
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,400
but of course

1096
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,460
for 3

1097
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:09,920
a typical wrong OK with the column space

1098
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:14,870
the columns are all multiples of 4 3 6 1 2

1099
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,180
the column space then goes in and like this direction

1100
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:23,710
so the column space

1101
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:30,720
when I look at those columns the columns space only dimensional to the rank is

1102
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,830
1 its multiples of

1103
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:41,830
all of for 8 OK

1104
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:45,200
and what's the null space of A transpose

1105
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,550
the perpendicular

1106
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:51,480
there's so this was the null space

1107
01:11:51,550 --> 01:12:00,420
of 8 and this is the null space of A transpose OK

1108
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:04,050
what I want to say here is that the

1109
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:06,940
that choosing these orthogonal basis

1110
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:12,650
for the row space and the columns space is like no problems

1111
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,610
that there only one dimensional

1112
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,880
so what should be the

1113
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,290
they should be

1114
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:23,030
V 1 but yet the ones that have the wines is supposed to be a

1115
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:25,720
unit vector there's only 1

1116
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:30,980
the wondered choose here only 1 dimension in the row space I just wanna make

1117
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:34,510
it a unit vectors so the 1 will be

1118
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:41,940
be this vector but made into a unit vector so

1119
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,460
4 . 8 . 6

1120
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:49,570
453 350

1121
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:54,740
and what will be you want you want will be the unit vector there so

1122
01:12:54,760 --> 01:13:00,620
I wanna turn for 8 or 1 true into a unit vectors so you want

1123
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,510
will be

1124
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:08,610
the it's 1 2 minutes what multiple of 1 to do I want that has

1125
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:13,200
length square root of 5 so I have to divide by square root of

1126
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:20,610
let me complete the singular value decomposition for this made

1127
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:23,030
so this matrix

1128
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:26,960
4 3 8 6

1129
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:33,120
so I know what you want here's the here's a

1130
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:36,850
and I wanna get you the basis and

1131
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,400
column space

1132
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:41,510
and it has to start with the

1133
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:49,410
1 over the square root of 5 2 over square of

1134
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:52,900
then I 1

1135
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,200
the signal

1136
01:13:57,110 --> 01:14:01,310
what expecting our 1st signal

1137
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:06,610
where is what this is only about is only a rank one matrix where only

1138
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:08,900
expecting a signal 1

1139
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,370
which I have to find

1140
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:18,010
0 0 OK so what signal was

1141
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:21,640
if we should see that should be

1142
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,350
where where did the signals coming from

1143
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:26,880
they came from a transpose

1144
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:32,620
so I can do that little calculation over here A transpose is

1145
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,880
for 3 4 3 8 6

1146
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:41,610
times 4 3 8 6

1147
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:46,660
this had better this is a rank one matrix this is gonna be the whole

1148
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:52,920
thing will have rank 1 that 16 and 64 is 80

1149
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:56,810
12 and 48 is 16

1150
01:14:56,810 --> 01:15:05,180
12 and 14 years 60 and 9 36 and 45 OK it's a rank rank-one

1151
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,120
Of course

1152
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:11,370
every row is a multiple of 4 3

1153
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:15,700
and what's the eigen the eigen values of the matrix

1154
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:21,070
so this is like the calculated like practising now what are the eigenvalues of this

1155
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:23,370
rank one matrix

1156
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:27,680
well tell me when eigen value since the rank is only once

1157
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:30,030
1 eigen value is going to be

1158
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:35,050
and then you know that the other eigen value is going to be

1159
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:44,490
so that's sigma squared right in a transpose so this will be the square root

1160
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:47,660
of a twenty

1161
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,010
and then finally

1162
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:52,010
the UV transpose

1163
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:56,610
the movies will be

1164
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,990
there is the 1

1165
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:00,360
and wanted the to

1166
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:03,030
wants me to

1167
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:07,640
what's how do I make this into it

1168
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:09,510
orthonormal basis

1169
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:12,110
well the 2 is

1170
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:18,340
all in the null space direction it's it's perpendicular that's 0 . 6 and minus

1171
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:23,280
so those are the visa go going here

1172
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,010
. 6

1173
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:30,910
and . 6 minus point

1174
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:37,410
and I guess a better finishes here so this guy

1175
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:43,010
all I want is to complete the orthonormal basis be coming from their it'll be

1176
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:49,470
2 over square root of 5 and a minus 1 over square of I could

1177
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:53,200
have taken to take square 5 out of that

1178
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:55,840
matrix to make it look better

1179
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:59,410
so 1 over square root of 5

1180
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:01,820
at times 1 2

1181
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:04,530
minus 1

1182
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:06,350
well we're going to get

1183
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:10,590
when we do

1184
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:12,830
show that these are equivalent i'm just

1185
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:18,460
hands of approach because of the air and it's quite long enough have time

1186
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:20,970
you think

1187
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,620
to one of these proofs

1188
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,130
converting something like this

1189
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:35,520
and then

1190
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,570
that i is where you take

1191
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:45,120
they have offices in here and it

1192
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:46,580
to them

1193
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:49,290
you do to the later

1194
01:17:52,300 --> 01:18:01,380
it's something it implied by all the hypothesis sorry

1195
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,280
to do that sort

1196
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:09,560
here it is stated that are in the input semicolons between the position of the

1197
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,720
i was thinking of the mission to

1198
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:17,130
i just wrote a paper on this

1199
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,790
but i was converting

1200
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:23,570
two sequent calculus but to a hilbert style so

1201
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:26,220
that's the difference

1202
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:30,010
now the disjunction rules as usual a little bit fiddly

1203
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:31,430
production ones aren't

1204
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:34,160
this is straightforward the disjunction

1205
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,540
elimination rule

1206
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:44,350
a little bit for

1207
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:55,150
i mean that

1208
01:18:55,170 --> 01:19:00,590
exactly the destruction you think about it

1209
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:02,020
in those terms

1210
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:05,010
the disjunction introduction rules

1211
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:13,140
the fitch style system

1212
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:18,060
now mission rules a little bit different

1213
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:23,650
and every very very interesting i had interesting to us writing notes for this particular

1214
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:26,250
really interesting consequence that

1215
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:27,550
i had no idea

1216
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:30,140
the great both

1217
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,510
four five times actually

1218
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,330
four times

1219
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,390
the two anonymous course and that's a in in logic

1220
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:44,150
the notice this this particular feature that and what was interesting is a male two

1221
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:51,730
and you never noticed the there's something very very

1222
01:19:54,230 --> 01:20:03,180
right then it's informative here

1223
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:05,820
you need some make

1224
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:26,260
what this tells us that if we had the structure why would replace

1225
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:29,040
and then that

1226
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,710
and we

1227
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,340
the structure would be in in

1228
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:35,810
place today

1229
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,730
and it entails

1230
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:39,350
and x

1231
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:42,480
turnstiles entails a or b

1232
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,140
we could replace

1233
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:48,420
they are the with access to get c

1234
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:50,310
this is sort transitivity

1235
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,780
four transitivity

1236
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:52,820
it tells us

1237
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:54,890
if we can get this from

1238
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:57,840
a or b and we could get a

1239
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:03,050
from x we could use x instead

1240
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:09,320
and now this one is very different about this rule and all the rest

1241
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:14,920
navigation and this is the rules get complicated and we're they get where they get

1242
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,990
we just don't have that much time and what i don't want to

1243
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:26,370
OK good morning over the weekend your assigned

1244
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:32,260
material from chapter one of the test and they don't really with three

1245
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:38,590
famous beginnings of pieces of classical music somebody tell me at the outset what were

1246
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:42,830
those three famous pieces

1247
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:46,290
and lady down here

1248
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:53,110
OK beethoven's fifth symphony what was the second one

1249
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:59,310
piano concerto number one of tchaikovsky and the third one

1250
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:03,130
this piece by ricard straus with this funny sounding german name will just call it

1251
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:08,930
our approach this profits are interested in those with three pieces and the issues there

1252
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:12,560
had to do with musical genre that we're going to talk a little bit more

1253
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:16,630
about it a moment and the instruments

1254
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:21,900
the instruments and you went ahead and work with listening exercises nine to eleven to

1255
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:27,870
engage the musical instruments a bit in those particular exercises and we have performers here

1256
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:32,110
today there are going to as you can see a demonstrate some of these instruments

1257
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:34,020
instruments for us

1258
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:38,380
let's make one point very clear at the outset

1259
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:44,920
often times i get student papers refer to beethoven's fifth song or tchaikovsky's

1260
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:46,480
first piano song

1261
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:50,150
now that's that's not good at all

1262
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:53,330
i these songs

1263
01:22:53,410 --> 01:22:58,580
what you have to have to make something is all

1264
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,200
you get have ten

1265
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:05,980
so we don't have in eighty percent of classical music we don't have the right

1266
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,350
we don't have attacked well yes with opera of course but the other eighty percent

1267
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:16,780
is purely instrumental music it works its magic again through purely instrumental so we can't

1268
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:21,700
really call those songs and this puzzle me one day i was sitting there and

1269
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:27,060
i two and i wanted to buy an interior movement of the modes are serenade

1270
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:32,330
so i was all set to purchase this said by

1271
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:33,860
so far

1272
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:40,060
that told me into that's where this terminology comes into play because an item is

1273
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:44,710
we buy song it could be purely instrumental but it's called by us all

1274
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:48,810
but we don't want to use that sort of parlance we want to be more

1275
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:53,750
and more sophisticated than that if you will and use other terms so we'll talk

1276
01:23:53,750 --> 01:24:01,390
generally about beethoven's compositions beethoven's piece or beethoven's work or his master worker schedule for

1277
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:06,090
our fancy you want to get where we could also go on and be a

1278
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:11,900
little little more precise and say it belongs to a particular genre we could use

1279
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:16,210
the name of the genre now be talking a lot about usual in this course

1280
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:22,890
genre is simply a fancy word for type or kind so what genre of peace

1281
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:26,470
is this by told well it's symphony

1282
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:32,940
symphonies have four movements have four movements what some movement

1283
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:36,210
well a movement is simply an independent piece

1284
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:41,600
it works often times the multiple movements in a symphony or concerto works with other

1285
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,810
movements they are independent yet they are complementary

1286
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:50,480
think of for example a sculpture garden you might have four independent sculptures in there

1287
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:56,690
but they relate one to another they make some sort of special sense one to

1288
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:02,990
another so symphonies have these four movements and they usually operate in the following way

1289
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:09,590
of fast opening movement a slower more lyrical second movement then a third movement that

1290
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:14,430
derive from the dance and then a fourth movement for movement that sort of again

1291
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:18,250
uptempo fast emphatic conclusion

1292
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:23,020
let's see how these play out let's see how things play out by means of

1293
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:27,650
a quick review of beethoven's fifth symphony so we're going to do here and it

1294
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:32,250
is going to go from the beginning of the track for the first movement of

1295
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:37,800
the second movement and so on and was just start let's just by way of

1296
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:42,740
of refreshing your memory the beginning of beethoven's fifth symphony

1297
01:25:42,820 --> 01:26:08,760
although there and we said last time it operates

1298
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:13,370
in that fashion and that beginning gives us a good opportunity to make a distinction

1299
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:18,450
between two types of melody between this idea of a motive

1300
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:24,150
and a theme both are sort of subsets of melody if you if you will

1301
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:29,000
as i say in the textbook there is the beginning of the beethoven fifth something

1302
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:34,550
like a musical punch in the nose right about it and grabbing here he interface

1303
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:40,470
whatever music it's not very long idea how many nodes in this opening gambit here

1304
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:47,780
four but short rods OK so that's a classic example of a motive motor just

1305
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:53,060
a little cell and you're out of which the composer will build other musical material

1306
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:55,870
my name is alexander the roads

1307
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:59,880
from united technologies research centre this is the story real

1308
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:02,270
using different data mining techniques for

1309
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,650
anomaly detection

1310
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:08,900
and this is a joint work with people from university of minnesota where i was

1311
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:12,130
there earlier

1312
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:15,560
the start how many of you

1313
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:18,080
working in the field of an infection

1314
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:20,170
right now

1315
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:24,740
a few people by some other interested to

1316
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:27,690
get involved in this area because of its

1317
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:31,390
one of the input field so this would be like

1318
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:35,580
outline of the story of the first to give some brief introduction

1319
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:42,940
they cover different aspects of anomaly detection in different applications we will present some taxonomy

1320
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:46,080
anomaly detection techniques can be

1321
01:27:46,210 --> 01:27:49,220
classified and present some of these techniques

1322
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,230
and finally present some case study

1323
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:55,930
i made some changes from the

1324
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,700
slides that you can probably

1325
01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:59,120
on your proceedings

1326
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:00,670
so you can

1327
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:04,610
download the new version of light my website

1328
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:07,730
you can copy from here

1329
01:28:07,930 --> 01:28:13,590
not many changes but still some time to do some new slides which don't have

1330
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,750
so you can just send me email and

1331
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:18,680
you know i also need the link and the presentation

1332
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:21,610
it's easier for you

1333
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:26,870
OK so so much continue

1334
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:31,560
OK so

1335
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:36,870
as you know real doing work in data mining and we thank thee

1336
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:41,010
drowning the data but at the same time we started for the knowledge this is

1337
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:47,000
the famous actors from eight to whole field of data mining begins

1338
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:53,340
and whoever in spite of this large amounts of data in particular is this is

1339
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:54,750
still quite rare

1340
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:59,560
and this is this is me here we have a dramatic influence

1341
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:02,030
and often in a negative sense

1342
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:07,120
what actually anomalies

1343
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:16,870
if you have any

1344
01:29:17,930 --> 01:29:21,400
so what is actually

1345
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:29,090
better in a way that does not belong to like regular behaviour does not

1346
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:31,500
belong to expected behavior

1347
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:33,060
from the data

1348
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:36,220
and on this also referred to as

1349
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:43,470
outliers some people called it the particularities some people call it surprises

1350
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:46,460
and so and so on

1351
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:52,620
in instances where anomaly detection can be useful cyber intrusions

1352
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,590
for example when you try to catch

1353
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:00,310
the senior computer network of computer credit card fraud detection than out of

1354
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:04,030
millions of credit card transactions people do all over the world

1355
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:07,350
some people still continues in fraudulent

1356
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:13,740
also different forcing mechanical systems for example if you collect the data

1357
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,820
when you're playing on your car and you also have to figure out

1358
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,400
there sort of false can be coming or if you want to take that unfolds

1359
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,310
in advance before they happen

1360
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:28,590
so all of this application basically

1361
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:31,240
anomaly detection can be important

1362
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:34,050
as i said

1363
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:36,280
these are real world anomalies

1364
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:41,280
and i mentioned the credit card fraud detection and cyber intrusions

1365
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:44,750
so this is a simple example what normally can be

1366
01:30:44,770 --> 01:30:46,220
so far

1367
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:50,340
so let's assume that we have these

1368
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,620
this big

1369
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:53,400
groups of data

1370
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:56,270
and one into the correspond to normal here

1371
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:59,220
coins that did not conform to this number here

1372
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:03,850
simplicity or one or two may be typical of of anomalies

1373
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:08,130
also the small groups of data that are far from anything else may also be

1374
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:12,510
considered as anomalies this is really after application sometimes

1375
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:17,270
this may correspond to be here or sometimes this may correspond to

1376
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:24,020
to some group for example if you're dealing with the network intrusion detection

1377
01:31:24,050 --> 01:31:28,980
in the network intrusion detection there are computer text called denial-of-service attacks

1378
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,800
analysis of service attacks there is no single natural connection involved in that attack there

1379
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:39,440
is usually hundreds of that you can actually be involved in that tag but

1380
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:43,230
and they look quite a normal and then you want to make the difference between

1381
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:47,010
them you want to see coming that regressions appear in the last few

1382
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:52,060
a few seconds coming from specific source that's probably the best way to that this

1383
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:56,000
kind of text so basically to construct additional features

1384
01:31:56,010 --> 01:32:00,790
to make this data points most of us would be form the clusters which is

1385
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:09,570
far from anything else so it's not necessarily the anomalies only the single instances

1386
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:15,990
so the dimension that people from different communities call the problem of anomaly detection

1387
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:20,000
with different names some of them are using the rare class mining summarises in china

1388
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:26,440
people use novelty detection exception mining noise removal and recently there is a book by

1389
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:29,210
nasim talib the black swan

1390
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:34,870
it's basically a very interesting book and his explaining why there is a huge impact

1391
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:39,170
on this highly improbable events like the nine eleven

1392
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:48,370
or predicting the stock market which may cause these days and so on

1393
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:52,820
so what are the key challenges when you're doing anomaly detection

1394
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:58,320
so first the big challenge is to define our representative the normal

1395
01:32:58,390 --> 01:33:00,930
region usually

1396
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:03,010
it's hard to get

1397
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:07,010
clear understanding what is normal especially when

1398
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:12,380
you don't have the label so there's another challenge the labelled data for training is

1399
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:17,940
not usually available for example in many real life applications have any labels you don't

1400
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:22,080
know what is normally knows what is normally if you're lucky you may know what

1401
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,300
is normal sometimes you know

1402
01:33:24,330 --> 01:33:26,730
several types of faults that may

1403
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:28,700
help you in your analysis

1404
01:33:28,730 --> 01:33:31,740
also the boundary between normal and

1405
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:36,240
outlying or anomalous behavior is not clear sometimes you have to figure it out and

1406
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:37,890
also the

1407
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:40,860
exact notion of an outlier is

1408
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:44,520
a different for different application for example

1409
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:47,730
if you have the same kind of data set

1410
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:51,980
OK we have more people

1411
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:55,260
if you go the same

1412
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:00,940
data sets that correspond to for example network intrusion detection log correspond to fault diagnostics

1413
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,050
if the tax system

1414
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,350
in the data set one

1415
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:13,120
from one application may be perfect behaviour while normally in another data set may correspond

1416
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,730
of probability theory

1417
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:20,200
what i want to know now is what is now my belief about

1418
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:23,730
given that i have observed one

1419
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,650
head OK

1420
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:30,930
bayes rule tells me that what i have to do is i have to multiply

1421
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:34,350
my prior probabilities pi times the likelihood

1422
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:38,710
OK and the likelihood is simple i i have it here is justified so basically

1423
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:44,170
i have multiplied by by the beta distribution with whichever parameters i had earlier OK

1424
01:34:44,190 --> 01:34:45,480
now if i do that

1425
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,680
actually things come out extremely simple

1426
01:34:47,690 --> 01:34:48,930
the posterior

1427
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:51,430
is also beta distribution

1428
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:54,250
and that's a very cool thing is very convenient thing

1429
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:58,120
and technically what this means is that

1430
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:03,380
the beta distribution is the conjugate prior to the to the bernoulli distribution

1431
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:07,470
so you say that if you have the likelihood function

1432
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:11,140
and if you pick a prior that when you multiply the posterior comes out in

1433
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:12,040
the same

1434
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:15,990
distribution family as a as a prior when you called conjugate

1435
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:20,140
now i have my personal strong opinion about conjugate priors like to share with you

1436
01:35:23,690 --> 01:35:25,940
conjugate priors are

1437
01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:28,230
essentially motivated by

1438
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:30,390
convenience most of the time

1439
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:32,760
i'm perfectly fine with them

1440
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:35,130
they're not limiting

1441
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:37,220
but if

1442
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:39,920
if you force yourself to choose a conjugate prior

1443
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,620
just because you are lazy

1444
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:45,350
and if you want to get nice distributions that are in the same family as

1445
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:48,030
the prior and you don't want to get

1446
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:52,400
things that are analytically intractable right because sometimes the problem is you can't even compute

1447
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:56,700
the normalizing constant you multiply an arbitrary likelihood by an arbitrary prior and you need

1448
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:00,400
to you know that to get the posterior need to compute the normalisation constant

1449
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:03,230
well tough luck sometimes you can write

1450
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:06,870
i just want to raise a word of caution here

1451
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,630
which is

1452
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:12,180
the most important thing is that you're certain

1453
01:36:13,450 --> 01:36:17,640
that the fact that the prior you've specified is not very limiting or is not

1454
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:20,210
biasing the whole thing dramatically OK

1455
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:21,700
so if

1456
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:24,960
if conjugacy means that you're going to betray

1457
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:27,390
your prior in a certain sense

1458
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:30,510
then you should just not

1459
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:35,590
so now we can turn on the record again so this was offline

1460
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:40,590
OK so i have a bit

1461
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:43,490
have observed ahead and now it all makes sense right we had said that i

1462
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:48,120
find it unlike like pseudocount in way right there in the way i expressed my

1463
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:53,200
prior as in sort of using pseudo counts so now the number of pseudo counts

1464
01:36:53,450 --> 01:36:56,740
increase the final phase is the one that takes care of the heads or make

1465
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,730
sense right so how does it look like in pictures

1466
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:04,190
it looks like this i had these two possible priors earlier OK beta one one

1467
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:09,500
beta three three and now observed overserved ahead a single head so how is the

1468
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:14,710
posterior going look like well both posteriors sort of gore little bit to the right

1469
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:18,630
OK so they both think that by now is is closer to one than it

1470
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:21,950
was before but they do it slightly differently

1471
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:26,020
and if you want what we can do this afternoon we can we can just

1472
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:31,200
work out those equations and you see that there there fairly simple if you're interested

1473
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,710
now again if we

1474
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,430
if you

1475
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:40,620
you know if is about was talking about customers and consultants and stuff like that

1476
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:45,800
so if you have a customer client comes and says and you giving this right

1477
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,260
is going to look at you and say you know what the hell i mean

1478
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:52,500
give me a number give me something i can understand them you figure the distribution

1479
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:54,670
so we said earlier that one thing we could do

1480
01:37:54,690 --> 01:37:56,010
is we could output

1481
01:37:56,030 --> 01:37:59,250
the average OK for example so we can give the

1482
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:01,410
we could give the average pi

1483
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:02,870
overall posterior

1484
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:05,000
now in general

1485
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:08,230
if we are going to make predictions we have a probabilistic model and we have

1486
01:38:08,230 --> 01:38:10,450
done bayesian inference with it

1487
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:13,340
we're going to do is the following and i'll show you some

1488
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:17,370
some figures made nervous about the time said OK

1489
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:23,090
if i have a posterior things neural networks again right now and given a new

1490
01:38:23,090 --> 01:38:24,870
input and i have to make a prediction

1491
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,520
and all i have is a posterior distribution over words i don't have the value

1492
01:38:28,790 --> 01:38:33,330
well it's easy what i would do conceptually is that we take samples from

1493
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:35,280
my posterior of the weights

1494
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:40,080
evaluate my neural net there that input producer prediction repeat repeat repeat an average all

1495
01:38:40,090 --> 01:38:41,100
that OK

1496
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:45,330
and this is just a clumsy way of saying that i just integrate out OK

1497
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:50,140
performed into one of my neural net over the distribution of the posterior distribution

1498
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:51,860
on the weights

1499
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:54,120
how does that work in this case

1500
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:58,780
well in this case now my customer wants to know you what the probability that

1501
01:38:58,780 --> 01:39:01,910
the coin is going to be heads that's what i want to don't give me

1502
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:04,640
distribution or anything like that

1503
01:39:04,690 --> 01:39:06,720
they can say OK fair enough enough

1504
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:08,850
for a fixed by

1505
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:12,260
if i didn't have a prior on it right then this trivially would be but

1506
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:16,120
i mean this equation here is simply but what's the probability of of heads given

1507
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:19,170
by his by but now

1508
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:22,840
we've we've changed the way we do things we're not doing maximum likelihood anymore so

1509
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:26,130
now we actually have a distribution over part

1510
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:30,470
OK we had prior distribution and now we've given ourselves the posterior distribution

1511
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,130
what this integral does

1512
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:34,420
abstract than that

1513
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:39,000
they can just be sending a message to another the computer

1514
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:42,960
so the machine with this need to send the messages the actuator and then the

1515
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:46,770
action is actually the message is also can be something that abstract is that

1516
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:47,860
at the top

1517
01:39:47,870 --> 01:39:51,590
the perceptron observations received by stencils

1518
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:52,800
so if it was

1519
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,630
a robot of some kind

1520
01:39:54,710 --> 01:39:56,300
probably expect to be

1521
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,920
some to computer some sort of the camera

1522
01:39:58,970 --> 01:40:02,920
which the robot is using to perceive the world could be sound or some other

1523
01:40:03,820 --> 01:40:06,040
or it could just be receiving

1524
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:07,860
characters from keyboard

1525
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:14,840
so i can be quite abstract two quite concrete like a camera

1526
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:21,730
so what we concerned about today is just going to

1527
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:27,970
this way

1528
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:33,170
so what we consider that today is what's in a question mark

1529
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:35,240
we have these environments we have this

1530
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:38,400
task we want the idea is to undertake

1531
01:40:38,410 --> 01:40:42,940
we know what it's got it's got a consensus about actuators

1532
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,180
what sort of software

1533
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:47,410
and where do we need to put in that box there

1534
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:48,420
in order

1535
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:49,850
for it to

1536
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:55,310
intelligently in some sense

1537
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:59,020
OK so he's just a bit more terminology

1538
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:01,030
so per percept

1539
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:05,040
is something that the agent receives from time to time from

1540
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,550
the environment

1541
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:10,670
percept sequence is the complete history of the percepts

1542
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:17,480
that the oceans receded since it started being deployed

1543
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:18,920
and typically

1544
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:20,780
in fact in the most general case

1545
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:22,790
the problem is this

1546
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:25,090
given the percept sequence

1547
01:41:25,130 --> 01:41:27,960
what should be the right action to perform

1548
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,150
in order to achieve some goal in order to maximize forms

1549
01:41:33,190 --> 01:41:36,870
mathematically that's the problem we have to somehow solve

1550
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:39,040
so this energy function

1551
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,730
abstract the agents

1552
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:42,800
o is represented by agent function

1553
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:46,680
the agent function takes as input a percept sequence

1554
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,920
some of the stuff

1555
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:50,940
that outputs in action

1556
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:53,820
the ground like again

1557
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,740
so the problem i i

1558
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:57,940
the problem of intelligence agents

1559
01:41:57,990 --> 01:42:01,180
is the problem of designing the eigenfunctions

1560
01:42:01,230 --> 01:42:06,100
plus the other problems and some related to the

1561
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:08,590
so in practice

1562
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:12,430
and i functions implemented by some programs

1563
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:15,550
and not just one thing that typically

1564
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:20,790
when the there should be sort of slightly different the agent programs

1565
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:25,220
he takes the last person is important

1566
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:26,600
that some stuff and then

1567
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:28,590
produces an action

1568
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:31,850
the previous percepts being received

1569
01:42:31,910 --> 01:42:33,570
man may not be stored

1570
01:42:33,630 --> 01:42:35,960
and in the most general case

1571
01:42:36,010 --> 01:42:36,930
the agent

1572
01:42:37,050 --> 01:42:40,250
program can keep the entire percept history

1573
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:42,450
the new two and

1574
01:42:42,510 --> 01:42:44,740
which action to perform

1575
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:47,810
or maybe something different that come to light

1576
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:50,080
the action programme in each state the

1577
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:51,320
it's a percept

1578
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:53,120
that's some reasoning

1579
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:54,390
finds in action

1580
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:57,840
guess randomly began

1581
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,700
rest the distinguish

1582
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:02,470
hardware from software

1583
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:06,330
so the architecture they called the actual machinery

1584
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:09,300
the agent made it might just be

1585
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:12,290
a laptop or maybe some fancy robot

1586
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:16,990
of running around my someone like that

1587
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,250
OK many questions that i have been

1588
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:23,780
after discussing

1589
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:27,000
so it is a very simple example to get the ideas across perhaps is too

1590
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,670
simple but anyway

1591
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:34,570
i hope

1592
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:37,370
so we very simple

1593
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:41,250
agent it's vacuum cleaner can be in two different rooms

1594
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:44,130
i and b understood

1595
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:45,460
so the percepts

1596
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:47,540
come in the form of appear

1597
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:49,970
consisting of the remnants in

1598
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:52,570
and whether in this study on

1599
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:57,030
this is this a year

1600
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:00,300
and the actions are either to move left and right

1601
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:01,820
to sack the

1602
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:04,140
or the not

1603
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:05,500
so this is an incredibly

1604
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:12,020
simple environment and the nation but because start somewhere

1605
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:14,260
so the percept sequence

1606
01:44:14,350 --> 01:44:16,620
a sequence of pairs

1607
01:44:16,630 --> 01:44:17,740
for the role

1608
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:24,450
so this is just the

1609
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:26,420
percepts when there's anyone

1610
01:44:26,430 --> 01:44:28,530
subsequent and there's only one person in it

1611
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:32,080
and that's too and then goes on down the page to infinitely long

1612
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:33,550
lavatory law

1613
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:38,780
so there's a percept sequence and i suppose that these are the actions of the

1614
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,530
agent will apply

1615
01:44:41,650 --> 01:44:44,520
particular cases

1616
01:44:44,530 --> 01:44:47,100
and you can see the agent programs

1617
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:49,270
is very very simple idea

1618
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:50,400
just the one

1619
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:53,090
and the bottom there

1620
01:44:53,150 --> 01:44:54,390
so what it does is

1621
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:58,040
it simply takes the last person

1622
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,170
it looks to see

1623
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:01,520
the first component

1624
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:03,300
so the second component

1625
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:06,560
it's clean or dirty

1626
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:09,680
in this study that sex

1627
01:45:09,690 --> 01:45:11,580
otherwise it's claim

1628
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,930
and looks to see whether it's location i in which case it goes to location

1629
01:45:16,210 --> 01:45:21,400
expecting that the standard location they always get the other way

1630
01:45:21,410 --> 01:45:22,830
OK so now

1631
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:24,940
very simple percepts

1632
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,540
very simple actions that can be applied

1633
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:31,340
very simple programs it's decides given percept

1634
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:38,450
the percept sequence which action to apply

1635
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:44,350
rational agent

1636
01:45:44,450 --> 01:45:47,490
in some sense does the right thing the question is

1637
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:49,310
what should the writing d

1638
01:45:49,370 --> 01:45:54,400
so in order to find that you have to have some kind of performance measure

1639
01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:56,830
and the usual thing is that

1640
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:58,530
the agent designer

1641
01:45:58,570 --> 01:46:02,000
imposes a performance measure on the edge

1642
01:46:02,010 --> 01:46:03,990
by some method or another

1643
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:07,470
so the idea that is the agent got some purpose in mind

1644
01:46:07,530 --> 01:46:09,570
it's got operating miles whatever else

1645
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:11,670
so be given some performance measure

1646
01:46:11,710 --> 01:46:17,410
and the idea is that then the agent tries to achieve performance measure

1647
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:21,170
given the performance measure can be

1648
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:22,260
quite tricky thing

1649
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:25,010
but in some cases incredibly difficult

1650
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:30,060
one possible thing is to

1651
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:32,350
essentially trying tell us what to do

1652
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:36,520
under different circumstances

1653
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:40,090
so you're trying to learn how to behave

1654
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:43,620
generally speaking it's

1655
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:45,850
more convenient

1656
01:46:45,910 --> 01:46:50,620
to give the idea to give the agent the idea of how good stages

1657
01:46:50,630 --> 01:46:53,170
have some measure how good state is

1658
01:46:53,170 --> 01:46:56,400
that the agent trying to get to good states

1659
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,140
some say that

1660
01:46:58,190 --> 01:47:00,950
so this behavior is determined by this design

1661
01:47:01,010 --> 01:47:03,240
to get a good state rather than

1662
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:04,330
telling it

1663
01:47:04,390 --> 01:47:07,690
which state to get to

1664
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:09,930
so there's a mathematical way of doing that

1665
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:10,960
which is

1666
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:15,160
concept called utility which has been heavily studied and i and

1667
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:17,410
especially in economics before that

1668
01:47:17,650 --> 01:47:19,050
parts of engineering

1669
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:26,650
of these structures  that are correct that's that are important at small Z so the measurements

1670
01:47:26,650 --> 01:47:33,090
are cleaner of systematic effects due to nonlinearities at large Z  however you don't

1671
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:38,150
expect dark energy to be important at large Z people say that but I don't

1672
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:45,800
know what I expect from dark energy so baryon acoustic oscillations are an

1673
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:53,230
emerging technique to give us information about dark energy another technique is measuring galax is

1674
01:47:53,230 --> 01:47:59,170
galaxy cluster surveys which measure a cluster mass a redshift and the spatial pro

1675
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:05,570
clustering properties of clusters this is sensitive to dark energy in many ways the volume

1676
01:48:05,570 --> 01:48:12,570
redshift relation the angular diameter distance relation the growth rate of structure and the amplitude

1677
01:48:12,570 --> 01:48:18,950
of clustering however there are problems with this technique the cluster selection must be well understood

1678
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:24,490
how do you tell whether there's a  calus a  cluster what proxy do do you use

1679
01:48:24,490 --> 01:48:28,210
for the mass of the cluster when you see the cluster it doesn't tell you

1680
01:48:28,210 --> 01:48:33,390
what the mass is  and presumably you're going to need photozes for this technique

1681
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:41,860
also finally there's the emerging technique of weak lensing so here is our observer again

1682
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:49,690
they all look like this looking at an object that undergoes gravitational lensing or a  deflection

1683
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:56,650
of light by some mass and  the angular scale of the deflection is related

1684
01:48:56,650 --> 01:49:03,550
to the mass of the lens the impact parameter and various geometric distances the distance

1685
01:49:03,550 --> 01:49:09,490
between the lense and the source and the distance between the observer and the source dark

1686
01:49:09,490 --> 01:49:15,610
energy affects the growth rate of the mass so dark energy enters here and dark

1687
01:49:15,610 --> 01:49:22,670
energy affects all the distance factors because it affects how the universe expands so weak

1688
01:49:22,670 --> 01:49:30,530
lensing gives us information about dark energy now weak lensing is about the opposite of

1689
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:36,890
supernovae for supernovae every single supernovae was useful for weak lensing the signal from any

1690
01:49:36,890 --> 01:49:43,390
single galaxy is too small to be useful but luckily there are a lot of

1691
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:48,350
galaxies in the universe so with  weak lensing you're sort of adding up the

1692
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:55,410
contribution from millions of galaxies to get a good signal there are systematic errors in weak

1693
01:49:55,410 --> 01:50:03,710
lensing one systematic error is the point spread function of the image caused by

1694
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:07,670
the atmosphere and the telescope so if you have a point-like source of course

1695
01:50:07,670 --> 01:50:15,370
the image because it's travelling through the atmosphere atmospheres are not convenient to astronomers and

1696
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:20,180
the telescope is not perfect as some blurringins of the image caused by the atmosphere and

1697
01:50:20,190 --> 01:50:26,510
the telescope and there will also be errors in the photometric redshift there is an

1698
01:50:26,510 --> 01:50:31,510
argument or a discussion under way about whether it's best to do this from space

1699
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:38,750
or the ground of course if you go to space there's no atmosphere to blur the images

1700
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:44,230
in space you can go to the near infrared which gives us better information

1701
01:50:44,230 --> 01:50:49,770
for photozes  however on the ground  you can have a bigger telescope and ground

1702
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:56,770
is less expensive the thing to remember in comparing ground projects to space projects is

1703
01:50:56,770 --> 01:51:05,790
that money weighs less in space the landscape today in dark en in weak lensing

1704
01:51:05,790 --> 01:51:13,230
there are projects going on today that look at hundreds of square degrees in deep multicolored data

1705
01:51:13,230 --> 01:51:19,190
the multicolor is important for the photometric redshifts there are also projects that look at thousands

1706
01:51:19,190 --> 01:51:28,330
of square degrees more shallow in twocolor data in two thousand and ten the dark energy survey will be

1707
01:51:28,330 --> 01:51:32,350
the next step in this direction that will look at thousands of square degrees

1708
01:51:32,350 --> 01:51:39,610
in deep multicolor data and the for the ground  the next step in this that

1709
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:48,270
will be two thousand fourteen two thousand fifteen two thousand thirteen is the LSST the large synoptic survey telescope which will

1710
01:51:48,270 --> 01:51:55,770
look at the full hemisphere very deep in six colors so we modeled one

1711
01:51:55,770 --> 01:52:01,110
of the questions that we were asked is are these projects worth it how well will

1712
01:52:01,110 --> 01:52:06,670
you do in being able to limit the properties of dark energy so we decided

1713
01:52:06,670 --> 01:52:12,770
to parameterize a dark energy equ equation  of state as simply as possible

1714
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:18,270
by two parameters again we wanna  measure the function W of A or W of Z

1715
01:52:18,270 --> 01:52:24,310
but we never measure functions we only measure parameterizations of functions so we pick

1716
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:32,090
a very simple parameterization and then we imagine as a standard eight-dimensional cosmological model

1717
01:52:32,090 --> 01:52:38,710
that includes the dark energy parameters W zero  the value today and W A

1718
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:44,790
which characterizes the change in the dark energy parameter omega dark energy omega matter omega baryon

1719
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:50,970
H nod the amplitude of fluctuations and the spectral index of the fluctuations so

1720
01:52:50,970 --> 01:52:57,670
this again you assume a cosmological model and you can predict how well some future

1721
01:52:57,670 --> 01:53:06,230
experiment will be  now we decided that it's not very useful to get precision measurements of

1722
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:14,550
omega dark energy the theory is off by a hundred and twenty orders of magnitude so asking

1723
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:21,130
observers to work very hard to get another significant figure on the result doesn't seem

1724
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:28,010
to be a good thing to do so the thing that we decided on

1725
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:32,400
is sixty four times more likely than hot to cold and back to her

1726
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:36,230
because these are better by a factor of eight to one so that way overrides

1727
01:53:37,090 --> 01:53:40,480
one is from decision we still think it might be called right the probability that

1728
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:45,190
this is you know we're still getting we're still getting something on the paths that

1729
01:53:45,190 --> 01:53:46,670
go through called say here

1730
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:52,320
just a lot less than we would have died in a one i screamed like

1731
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:57,030
this which is surrounded by cold it's were pretty sure called

1732
01:54:01,150 --> 01:54:05,170
let's do some experiments because that's why it's fun to do this stuff respiratory

1733
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:10,480
what would happen now if

1734
01:54:10,530 --> 01:54:14,110
what would happen now if we we can this whether inertia

1735
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:17,590
actually that's just totally take this whether inertia away

1736
01:54:17,610 --> 01:54:20,400
OK so hot there is

1737
01:54:20,460 --> 01:54:24,230
on cold days are equally likely to follow each other

1738
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:27,340
OK what does this look like now

1739
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:29,190
looks like the data

1740
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:30,920
so in fact

1741
01:54:30,940 --> 01:54:34,420
what this is saying this is seven days

1742
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:36,130
seven to one probability

1743
01:54:36,150 --> 01:54:40,260
the three ice-cream date will be hard to exactly this seven to one ratio here

1744
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:42,650
there's no information

1745
01:54:42,650 --> 01:54:44,710
at all from the surrounding days

1746
01:54:44,730 --> 01:54:47,610
because the day before the day after had nothing to do with the weather on

1747
01:54:47,610 --> 01:54:51,630
this day so this looks exactly like the picture that just squish down into the

1748
01:54:51,690 --> 01:54:56,820
well one seven two one seven range instead of the one to three range

1749
01:54:56,820 --> 01:54:59,990
it's exactly tracking the so this is like this is

1750
01:55:00,070 --> 01:55:06,340
kind of what you'd expect what would happen if we went to nt inertia

1751
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:11,050
so we decided the weather kind of with saws isn't earth venus rich earth after

1752
01:55:11,050 --> 01:55:13,980
the catastrophe

1753
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:16,150
after a cold day

1754
01:55:16,170 --> 01:55:18,300
it's likely to be a hot day

1755
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:21,750
and after a hard day it's likely to be a cold day a

1756
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:23,670
OK now what we have

1757
01:55:23,690 --> 01:55:25,960
now this is trying very hard to whipsaw

1758
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:29,510
so here actually this is rather interesting we have three one ice cream days in

1759
01:55:29,510 --> 01:55:33,610
a row things the middle one probably not just trying really hard to alternate

1760
01:55:33,630 --> 01:55:34,730
so going

1761
01:55:34,750 --> 01:55:37,340
i mean this is sort of the mirror image of what we had before and

1762
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:41,730
eleven were preferred ha ha that was sixty four times more likely here and saying

1763
01:55:41,730 --> 01:55:45,800
it prefers cold hot cold that sixty four times more likely than cold cold cold

1764
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:49,170
and when i sprinted

1765
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:53,630
so it's trying alternate over here didn't quite manage to alternate

1766
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:57,920
because you know there's sort of this phase reversal

1767
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:02,110
where it could manage to stitch the left half together with the right half by

1768
01:56:02,110 --> 01:56:06,130
alternating it was able to alternate much more happily and explained that he will still

1769
01:56:06,130 --> 01:56:08,110
kind of explaining the that over here

1770
01:56:08,170 --> 01:56:12,250
five and over here similarly if it took to heart disease and rho

1771
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:17,010
but it's trying real hard to alternate just as

1772
01:56:17,030 --> 01:56:20,210
back in the original set up

1773
01:56:20,260 --> 01:56:22,170
it was trying real hard

1774
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:26,300
something like this to keep the same weather

1775
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:29,380
here is keeping the same whether even though there's is

1776
01:56:29,420 --> 01:56:30,510
three hours per day

1777
01:56:30,510 --> 01:56:33,010
in the middle of the heart spell it just keeps in the middle of the

1778
01:56:33,010 --> 01:56:37,090
cold spell decides to keep it cold

1779
01:56:38,030 --> 01:56:40,400
so let's try another experiment

1780
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:45,510
maybe all

1781
01:56:47,090 --> 01:56:49,820
well it's too quickly

1782
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:53,210
so what happens if

1783
01:56:53,230 --> 01:56:55,110
what happens if we

1784
01:56:55,170 --> 01:56:58,010
change this column here

1785
01:56:58,090 --> 01:57:01,760
so that these are

1786
01:57:04,690 --> 01:57:07,380
let's try this

1787
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:09,460
OK what's going on here

1788
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:13,550
so now i've said that both cold days and hot days are likely to be

1789
01:57:13,550 --> 01:57:18,690
followed by heart disease

1790
01:57:18,730 --> 01:57:22,510
so one thing that certainly happen is that they become more likely

1791
01:57:22,570 --> 01:57:37,300
both how does this relate to this picture after

1792
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:38,960
basically no inertia again

1793
01:57:38,980 --> 01:57:40,760
again these values here

1794
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:42,460
correspond exactly to

1795
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:45,670
one two and three

1796
01:57:46,750 --> 01:57:50,050
because again we get no evidence from the surrounding whether

1797
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:54,260
maybe a little counterintuitive but think about from here

1798
01:57:54,260 --> 01:57:58,260
the probability of a hot day to day doesn't doesn't depend on what the weather

1799
01:57:58,260 --> 01:57:59,860
was the previous day

1800
01:57:59,860 --> 01:58:02,940
so we get no inertia effect

1801
01:58:03,010 --> 01:58:05,590
or so

1802
01:58:05,690 --> 01:58:15,110
we have that's just undo this here OK

1803
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:18,710
so we have this reconstruction this looks pretty nice right

1804
01:58:18,730 --> 01:58:22,250
but there is something fundamentally funny about

1805
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:25,690
what's funny about it is we claimed here

1806
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:31,110
that cold day is about twenty percent of the time i two ice-creams and hot

1807
01:58:31,110 --> 01:58:32,670
days similarly

1808
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:36,460
now let's look at the at the days here that i predicted to be called

1809
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:40,480
yes it's true that about twenty percent of the time i made into ice ice-creams

1810
01:58:40,550 --> 01:58:43,170
but if we look at the days that i predicted to be that we predicted

1811
01:58:43,170 --> 01:58:44,480
to be high

1812
01:58:44,530 --> 01:58:48,460
about forty percent of the time i'm meeting two ice-creams this numbers

1813
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:51,130
basically and consistent with the data

1814
01:58:51,150 --> 01:58:54,550
it should be point four according to our reconstruction

1815
01:58:54,570 --> 01:58:59,230
so all assumptions seem to be undermining themselves when we use

1816
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:04,030
these assumptions which i just pulled out my error right to to estimate this graph

1817
01:59:04,300 --> 01:59:09,110
the graph on the data the graph then gives us some conclusions which are inconsistent

1818
01:59:09,110 --> 01:59:11,570
with my original assumption

1819
01:59:11,610 --> 01:59:14,820
so what we really like is for them to be consistent

1820
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:18,380
so what do you think we could do

1821
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:21,250
maybe we should just these assumptions

1822
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:27,960
in fact one reasonable way to adjust the assumptions is to take the probabilities that

1823
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:29,710
we estimated here

1824
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:32,780
and put them back into the table

1825
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:35,020
it's also to do that in a minute but first i want to show you

1826
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:36,860
the results

1827
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:45,760
so as we scroll right on the spreadsheet i've got another graph

1828
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:49,730
where i've updated the probabilities based on what we saw in the previous graph on

1829
01:59:49,730 --> 01:59:53,050
the previous graph forty two percent of the two ice cream days

1830
01:59:53,050 --> 01:59:55,440
of the highlights from today's given high

1831
01:59:55,460 --> 01:59:59,360
we're two ice days and still about twenty percent of the coldest winters were two

1832
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:00,490
ice cream days

1833
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:09,110
so now i know i get a new reconstruction

1834
02:00:10,630 --> 02:00:16,130
that's kinda interesting the the picture is actually a little different

1835
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:21,010
all these numbers kind of changed actually so now we used to think that

1836
02:00:21,090 --> 02:00:23,570
we were equally likely to have a cold day on a hot day at the

1837
02:00:23,570 --> 02:00:26,300
start of the diary now we're pretty sure that it was a hot at the

1838
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,050
sort of the diary

1839
02:00:28,070 --> 02:00:30,880
OK because when we go left here

1840
02:00:31,070 --> 02:00:34,730
we see the book it probably was hot then at the start of the diary

1841
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:38,460
so we just really we we took those things with that them back

1842
02:00:38,610 --> 02:00:41,300
to that end we got a new picture

1843
02:00:45,110 --> 02:00:47,610
you you might wonder why this isn't circular

1844
02:00:47,650 --> 02:00:50,420
and the reason is that you know we're taking the output of the model were

1845
02:00:50,420 --> 02:00:53,880
feeding back in how can learn anything and the answer is that the data come

1846
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:54,750
into it

1847
02:00:54,750 --> 02:01:00,190
so what we're getting a compromise between the model and the model is making some

1848
02:01:00,190 --> 02:01:01,630
it starts here

1849
02:01:01,650 --> 02:01:06,970
and i will try to join the limit cycle

1850
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:12,930
well i mean by stability stability means that nearby guys

1851
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:18,220
the guys start somewhere else eventually approach the limit cycle

1852
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:23,350
regardless of whether they start from the outside or start from the inside so that

1853
02:01:25,230 --> 02:01:30,300
and unstable limit cycle but i'm not calling it a limit cycle of this unstable

1854
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:36,420
and just going into a closed trajectory but let's draw one which is unstable OK

1855
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:41,760
here's the way we look at its unstable guys which starred nearby will be repelled

1856
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:45,130
driven somewhere else

1857
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:47,030
or they start here

1858
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:49,400
well go away from the thing

1859
02:01:49,410 --> 02:01:51,970
instead of going to war

1860
02:01:52,050 --> 02:01:54,010
so this is unstable

1861
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:59,140
and i don't call it limit cycle is just just the closed trajectory

1862
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:10,620
cycle because it's cycles around around limit because this is the limit of the nearby

1863
02:02:12,750 --> 02:02:16,300
the other case where it's unstable it's not the limit of course you could have

1864
02:02:16,330 --> 02:02:23,010
a case also where the curve outside spiraling toward it but the ones inside are

1865
02:02:23,010 --> 02:02:24,680
repelled this

1866
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:28,430
then we can also be stable and you can make up all sorts of cases

1867
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:32,550
and i think i one point drew them in the notes but

1868
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:34,190
i'm not going to

1869
02:02:34,330 --> 02:02:40,150
the only interesting one of permanent importance people study of the actual limit cycles state

1870
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:43,500
now was the stable close trajectories

1871
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:49,450
notice by the way a closed trajectory is always a simple curves

1872
02:02:49,590 --> 02:02:53,900
remember what that means from eighteen o two

1873
02:02:53,900 --> 02:03:00,870
simple means it doesn't cross itself why doesn't across itself

1874
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:04,380
it can cross itself because tried to

1875
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:06,320
what's wrong with that point

1876
02:03:06,930 --> 02:03:09,650
at that point which which is the vector field goal

1877
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:14,640
that way or that way

1878
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:17,730
why the interest to limit cycle well

1879
02:03:20,190 --> 02:03:22,170
because there are systems in nature

1880
02:03:23,940 --> 02:03:28,070
which just this type of behaviour they have a certain periodic

1881
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:32,380
and if you disturb

1882
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:40,320
gradually returned to its original interior original periodic state a simple example is breathing

1883
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:45,570
now i feel self-conscious all your breathing you really

1884
02:03:45,650 --> 02:03:49,990
well radar you breathing while you're unaware of of course except now

1885
02:03:53,150 --> 02:03:54,640
if you're sitting here

1886
02:03:54,650 --> 02:03:56,070
listening to

1887
02:03:56,130 --> 02:03:59,780
certain temperature certain air circulation in the room

1888
02:03:59,830 --> 02:04:03,320
not thinking of anything certainly not lecture

1889
02:04:03,630 --> 02:04:07,980
and the lecture is not a two weeks is not unduly exciting

1890
02:04:09,270 --> 02:04:11,610
that certain steady rate which

1891
02:04:11,620 --> 02:04:13,880
a little different for every person but

1892
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,100
that's right now

1893
02:04:15,110 --> 02:04:18,540
you can artificially change that you can say OK and i'm going to brief as

1894
02:04:18,540 --> 02:04:20,480
to how

1895
02:04:20,610 --> 02:04:22,550
that you and indeed you can

1896
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:26,380
but as soon as you stop being aware of what you're doing

1897
02:04:27,030 --> 02:04:32,850
the levels of various hormones and carbon dioxide your bloodstream and so on will return

1898
02:04:32,850 --> 02:04:35,640
your breathing to the natural state

1899
02:04:35,650 --> 02:04:37,230
with natural state

1900
02:04:37,290 --> 02:04:40,280
in other words it's behaving in the system

1901
02:04:40,290 --> 02:04:42,200
that system of your breathing

1902
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:45,410
which is controlled by various chemicals and hormones

1903
02:04:45,450 --> 02:04:48,780
in the body of is

1904
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:56,650
exhibiting exactly this type of behavior has a certain regular periodic motion is the system

1905
02:04:56,650 --> 02:05:01,440
and if the stir before officially set out somewhere else

1906
02:05:01,450 --> 02:05:05,430
it will gradually returned to its original state

1907
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:09,140
now of course but if i'm running of course will be different short you're running

1908
02:05:09,260 --> 02:05:13,420
brief faster but that's because the parameters in the system

1909
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:16,750
o BA's and the bees and the equation

1910
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:20,240
yes in the x what the f of x y and g x y

1911
02:05:20,270 --> 02:05:25,220
parameters in those functions will be set at different levels you have different hormones different

1912
02:05:25,220 --> 02:05:28,470
amount of carbon dioxide and so on

1913
02:05:28,510 --> 02:05:32,180
now i'm not saying the breathing is modeled by a limit cycle

1914
02:05:32,530 --> 02:05:36,430
it's the sort of thing which one might look for limit cycle that that's of

1915
02:05:36,430 --> 02:05:38,640
course the question for biologists

1916
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:42,730
in general any

1917
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:48,360
type of periodic behavior nature of people try to see if there is

1918
02:05:48,370 --> 02:05:54,500
systems of differential equations which governs which perhaps there is a limit cycle

1919
02:05:54,540 --> 02:05:59,910
which can take to look like

1920
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:03,530
well one of the problems the

1921
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:07,130
in this sense limit cycles are easy to lecture about because so little is known

1922
02:06:07,130 --> 02:06:11,140
about at the end of the period if i have time i'll give you

1923
02:06:11,190 --> 02:06:16,860
also use the simplest possible questions you could answer is totally answer to it

1924
02:06:16,870 --> 02:06:20,240
good as is to the attitude is totally unknown

1925
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:26,620
one hundred twenty years trying to study trying

1926
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:32,650
OK but let's first talk about what sort of problems people address with limit cycle

1927
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:35,950
first of all is the existence problem

1928
02:06:36,030 --> 02:06:44,930
if i give you a system like this is to be on the right-hand side

1929
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:48,320
x squared plus two IQ minus three x y and

1930
02:06:48,350 --> 02:06:50,720
g is something similar i say OK

1931
02:06:50,730 --> 02:06:52,790
does this have limit cycles

1932
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:55,290
well you know how to find the critical points

1933
02:06:58,650 --> 02:07:01,640
but how do you find out as limit cycles the

1934
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:04,330
answer to that is nobody has any idea

1935
02:07:04,350 --> 02:07:11,650
so this problem is in general no in general

1936
02:07:11,770 --> 02:07:15,600
there are no no

1937
02:07:15,610 --> 02:07:17,740
not much in the way of method

1938
02:07:17,750 --> 02:07:18,580
not much

1939
02:07:18,610 --> 02:07:26,800
not much is known

1940
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:31,300
there's one theorem that you find in the nodes the simple theorem called the parker

1941
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:33,510
a benedictine theorem

1942
02:07:37,970 --> 02:07:43,530
for about sixty or seventy years was about the only result known which enable people

1943
02:07:43,530 --> 02:07:45,540
to find limit cycles

1944
02:07:47,020 --> 02:07:53,060
the theorem is use relatively little because people try to find limit cycle by computer

1945
02:07:53,070 --> 02:07:56,450
now the difficulty is you have to know where to look for them

1946
02:07:56,480 --> 02:08:01,070
in other words the computer screen shows that much you set the axes

1947
02:08:01,170 --> 02:08:05,140
and it doesn't show any limit cycles that doesn't mean there aren't any these are

1948
02:08:05,140 --> 02:08:05,990
over there

1949
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:10,110
or means is the big one like this

1950
02:08:10,130 --> 02:08:12,700
and you're looking in the middle of don't see it

1951
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:14,760
so in general people

1952
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:20,690
don't look for limit cycles until less the physical system which gave rise to the

1953
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:21,570
to the

1954
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:24,830
it's a pair of differential equations
