1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
each voxel at the time you just go into one voxel and then you for

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,110
example see if the responses are significantly different in the two cases you just the

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,710
ricci tensor something like that now

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,480
these maps

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,320
partly coincide

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:21,000
but there are independent because i mean the the classifier is more general ultimately you

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,710
will always be able to pick up a brain area ways we see an average

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,170
increase because the classifier will also be able to respond to an overall increase

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,820
and this you remove it

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,030
which is what we typically do because we're interested in these two is orthogonal axes

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,690
how one axis is the patterning and the other axis is kind of the DC

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:48,000
component across the area and i don't have this image here but what you find

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,480
is that this is not always the part of the brain that where the overall

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,340
activity is increased

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,900
you know

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,440
so if you know what i mean with the of what way we don't get

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,380
information of the individual works level more

18
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,050
if you plot the selectivity

19
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,300
what you see all show you slide further down what you'll see is if you

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,400
plot the single voxel selectivity

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,170
what you see is that the effects of each walks all of the univariate just

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,300
thanks very very small

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,230
and the you have the juxtaposition of voxels that prefer one or the other conditions

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,520
so it's true patterning of the signal is not just kind of overall effect or

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,770
something like that

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,980
but also in the because of the covariance if you if you if you neglect

27
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:44,610
the covariance then you know classifier straight strongly breaks down so there's information actually also

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,170
stored in the code

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:03,840
exactly but the point with the classical october analysis is just that it doesn't have

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,230
the sensitivity

31
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,230
for example you find in in the study of show you in a minute i

32
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,880
actually have taken all these slides out because just to shorten things because normally have

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,360
the slide show you the the normal effects as well as classical effects in the

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,590
next video show you know there's a very clear dissociation you find the brain area

35
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,750
that doesn't show an overall increase during the task it just shows change in the

36
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,670
and that's something if you were to one i heuristic for example could be i

37
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,170
i only look at those parts of the brain that showing higher activity when you're

38
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,270
doing the task

39
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,800
but that's not good because these are only partly overlap in these areas

40
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,920
yeah exactly

41
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,480
is that these are the different possibilities one possibility is that the whole area goes

42
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,820
up or down the classical analysis

43
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,210
and was

44
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,360
so what do you mean

45
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:11,070
now that's that's what i said just now there's very weak information if you just

46
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,480
look at that if you just look at the information of the single voxel level

47
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,290
it's very weak

48
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,990
but the point is that the point is that if you go back to this

49
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,960
scheme here

50
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,650
back to this this graph here

51
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,550
is it

52
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,730
this one

53
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,230
it seems that the case is more like this

54
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,020
and like this

55
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,270
this will be where you get a single voxel if you get an effect

56
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,270
hey you wouldn't see an effect and the effect is more like this than like

57
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:12,130
well i mean there's a thresholding thing here so you can threshold this at different

58
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,880
levels with different levels of degrees of conservative party

59
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,400
and if few threshold this with the kind of law degree of sense selectivity sensitive

60
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,360
conservative party features each is a lot of pressure higher threshold then you you you

61
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,840
see more visual information i can show you in a second i can show you

62
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,290
another slide where you see how this builds up doesn't mean that there is no

63
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:40,610
information what it shows is particularly hard a large amount of information whenever any neuroscience

64
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,020
techniques to use

65
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,380
has a problem with negative findings based don't find anything doesn't mean there's something in

66
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,480
the brain area where somebody could be in small cells it could be in some

67
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,420
aspect the firing that you have investigated and so we always have this problem is

68
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,340
not finding

69
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,380
well that's what this do this what this does

70
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,690
and the object is immediately free because there are people using the output

71
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,340
is there wait until point some future time we know that

72
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,920
everybody you point must stop

73
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,440
and at that point you thrown objects

74
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,860
so you may use a lot of extra memory one

75
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,490
well in terms of both the days she would take over

76
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,880
but you avoid avoided locking

77
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,170
this is the things i ever written order

78
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:44,380
and there is nothing of importance in this direction

79
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,670
can talk about this

80
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,130
a little bit already

81
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,860
look at any modern device driver and look at where the existing few drivers model

82
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,800
the going we're trying to fix

83
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,030
the current model is trying reach devices

84
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,610
actually enumerates the bus

85
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,690
so the PCI the figures what PCI devices exist

86
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,340
devices are not so much functions table so you look at PCI device drug use

87
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,220
PCI vendor identify society

88
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,400
that is

89
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,320
so usually supposed to be always not quite

90
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,840
that allows the

91
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,530
thank say well i should try to destroy

92
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,760
and their exported user space modularity can also look through modules

93
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:46,470
this PCA device idea i should this module figure with which kernel drivers

94
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,240
when you know the driver

95
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,110
everything existing that is called kernel function or

96
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,070
similarly when you are

97
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,260
when you remove hardware is removed that whole thing

98
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,970
to clean up the article like

99
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,170
if you remove the driver rather special routines

100
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,320
we fight the remove recall remove three

101
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,400
o devices saying this is going to play this correlated

102
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,110
so there is no special cases like know

103
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:23,670
we see that everything on your system is essentially dynamic

104
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,900
how management is an ongoing one

105
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,690
it turns and you want the case not so long ago the next management with

106
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,130
windows XP and certainly with this

107
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,050
was also

108
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,900
we were

109
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,510
way way behind in terms of

110
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,450
the collapse of life

111
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,990
very few particular et al do some work on it and somebody is really really

112
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,610
sitting in the tree

113
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:57,340
but it's not just about getting hardware not just the kernel space

114
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,320
you don't stop the process

115
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,710
one process have multiple power states

116
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,690
and there are different kind of idle state CPU

117
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,150
but it takes time

118
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,070
and energy move even if inactive i believe that the longer you can stay i'd

119
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,940
and this is taken to the extreme things mobile many which was the only thirty

120
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,950
seconds of time

121
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,780
the CV essentially to know

122
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,110
because pretty good so you can figure out the power level we should be you

123
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,420
are said to have management governance

124
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,510
to determine how we should move between power

125
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,400
actually gets dried powder in too

126
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:48,220
should we try to figure out what i was getting work done

127
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,570
there are some difficult questions that have managed to gain

128
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,450
because if you're in the middle of the quite scales

129
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,990
whatever the latest preferred mass

130
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,590
that was the case

131
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,310
and your machine size of we doing okay we just turn CPU speed and it

132
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,630
can be quite nice not you actually the circus

133
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,650
so you set strategy on

134
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,590
but most of what determines

135
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,950
four is how often you wake up person

136
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:24,400
now we can fix some of the car race cars like that's all for the

137
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,970
most of the necessary way users

138
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:34,050
i think i application field customers flash animator

139
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,900
programs like the temporal point some of the clock applications on the desktop

140
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,300
used to wake up about fifty times a second to with pocket change

141
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,030
but maybe the second

142
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,010
something like that more practical

143
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,970
o if you turn the second of one minute is what it does now

144
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,340
and i alert you when you start looking for the you can start to reduce

145
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,760
the power to heal she material

146
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,470
and there is a project few what

147
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,970
that's all

148
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,900
which has some tools things out of which we have to tell you

149
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,590
what what is causing wake yuichi

150
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,380
which software needs fixing

151
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,030
only now ahead windows have management we weakened

152
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,360
because we are in this situation we could fix all these space applications

153
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,550
that is to be going in all sorts of people

154
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,780
because systematically working on this

155
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,260
in the microsoft case all i can do share the people who produced the right

156
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,300
pieces by itself we don't care

157
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,860
they like you are causing problem

158
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:48,030
with another reason you are

159
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,610
again this is this is what problem

160
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,400
if you have the power to you want to turn things off

161
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,280
the all model we have

162
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,170
similar symbol

163
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,090
really designed for embedded systems is that which is like the things off

164
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,400
the problem is you've got all the good for example to this control

165
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:17,880
so PCI slot for this controlled so there's an order

166
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,320
this for example

167
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,970
plus this cash to this

168
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,610
ten of the farm

169
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,720
based on the controller son of trouble this universe

170
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,970
and turn it back on again in reverse order

171
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,130
so we we using the bus device hierarchies we got to myself to try and

172
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,380
do this

173
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:44,530
still one needed in this area things that some of the spens stuff spend this

174
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,280
particularly spend around still like you

175
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,800
this work being done there

176
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,280
fully interesting things

177
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,780
because the mainframe to mobile phones even some of the same requirements

178
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,070
the last time you wait things are

179
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,990
that's about three years ago

180
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,350
of blog posts which i will have been

181
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,780
between the model which resisted and data

182
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,510
that's quite high overlap as compared to

183
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,890
other categories which are french and in that

184
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,540
not infringe like this can be presented difference between

185
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,990
influential and active bloggers because if you look at this two and s three

186
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:30,740
you can see there is high chance for influential bloggers to be on big

187
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,990
as compared to

188
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,080
non inferential barack obama

189
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,530
but different provide the distribution of

190
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,100
the blog posts and they

191
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,180
on the left and

192
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:49,160
and that happened the blog on the right

193
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:55,870
very are compared the different parameters that we had in the market

194
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,890
so in this chart of maybe did this chart was we

195
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:05,820
compare the top twenty blog posts from our model and the twenty from the biggest

196
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,080
spectrum of the categories they belong to

197
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,890
in this case for the last six months we have been engineered five different configuration

198
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,560
similar to the previous case where you have no links no comments not things no

199
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,600
blog post

200
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,760
and all the parameters that

201
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,870
as you can see four

202
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,010
o for all the parameters that have the highest overlap

203
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:33,410
so even if you remove any single better the or decreases distributed

204
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,810
so this suggests that although

205
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,450
important but not equally important so you can figure out

206
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:45,580
elements order of these parameters based on the overlap and based on the country different

207
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,620
which is shown in the world

208
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,910
which is you

209
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,760
i have links as the most important parameter

210
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,560
and then comment which is the kind of

211
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,800
discussion denoted by different by this blog post and then of things which is nobody

212
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,660
and the local slant which is

213
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,780
and the block was which is somebody so basically you can also improve this morning

214
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,680
by using

215
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,520
different quality statistics may go

216
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,370
so the analysis of these block fixed rather than just having the numbers of block

217
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,950
because you can also have spam blog which

218
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,930
so putting the things for some reason we don't mean anything

219
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:32,820
there are we there is some room for improvement in this morning

220
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,890
so the

221
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,430
this is again something called papers

222
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,570
which we

223
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,740
so these are the list of references

224
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,470
and find

225
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,320
so let's look at the

226
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,180
i mentioned before this is sort of the a framework which we use for

227
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,650
finding the familiar strangers

228
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,120
so given about

229
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,800
generally though

230
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,020
clusters and then

231
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,350
we try to find

232
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,470
similar markers for this guy

233
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:30,150
using the cavity nesters and the wisdom collective wisdom

234
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,980
it was there was basically share knowledge which is right by individuals and groups together

235
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,820
and they can use can be used to solve problems

236
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,360
this is derivatives group is the most quintelligence

237
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,480
we this for blacklisting because there's a lot of users in it content

238
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,120
on log and this is probably prominent feature of social so several users tag and

239
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,820
categories their blogs so

240
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,950
use their in their submitted information as

241
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,190
OK activist

242
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:01,230
so why do we use the obviously there are some other traditional approaches but the

243
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,970
problems with these keywords clustering produces high dimensionality sparsity

244
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,940
and they require the number of clusters a private and then similarity measure

245
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,760
so we can study on

246
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,100
block taxonomy which is is not catalogues we downloaded from blogcatalog

247
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,230
so this is an amazing this way you have look these on the top and

248
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,540
you have the popular tags then you have some recent blog posts

249
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,540
snippets of his and blog posts and each of these blog posts have their own

250
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,720
tag which is about that

251
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,060
as you can see in this you have the categories we use these categories to

252
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,900
generate category deletion graph

253
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,570
as indicated here

254
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,770
this graph this is an instance of this graph is basically generator based on the

255
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,950
number of users which can different categories so if a blogger blogs in category c

256
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,830
one and c two we weakening these together

257
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,280
and the numbers on the edge indicates the strength of these connections with the blogosphere

258
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,740
that computers and blogging related

259
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,150
so we consider them as

260
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,520
one graph

261
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,200
so based on these are user submitted categories

262
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,010
we generate the generated this kind of

263
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,570
getting relationship graph

264
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,890
the categories they follow were taxonomy like this one it's not comprehensive taxonomy but you

265
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:35,350
can go to block catalog site and you can look at the taxonomy

266
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,970
not not very big but it's quite comprehensive

267
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,140
so we constructed sets based on different versions of

268
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,190
these taxonomy like this to

269
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,400
first level of the whole taxonomy are we split some nodes based on the pattern

270
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,400
based on the frequency of blogs in those categories

271
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,100
so that the collected data is

272
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:06,110
like we have for RC bloggers and then we grant their social network in the

273
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,700
first fashion

274
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,070
so another obvious question is

275
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,520
these forty bloggers sufficiently enough to

276
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,640
comment on the

277
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,810
so we did some analysis by

278
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,510
decreasing increasing in the number of the blogs so we did for starting from one

279
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,360
to six months and as you can see in the graph

280
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,440
as you had four five and six bloggers the

281
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,270
the amount of data collected and that so

282
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,360
that gives an indication that

283
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,620
even if you start collecting

284
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,270
data for one more number of bloggers you're not

285
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,150
it had do this is by a large amount so you can have

286
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,190
are they

287
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,060
less included dataset

288
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,980
so we started the study for four numbers

289
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,220
the different editions which is stalking or was the top level in the taxonomy on

290
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,530
all categories in the taxonomy of minutes split just one node which is the portion

291
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,770
or based on

292
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:09,860
the skew distribution which is this chart which is basically every blogger is using personal

293
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,900
as the category so

294
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,020
a lot of bloggers that's going into personal because you know they don't know what

295
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,040
the categories are definitely which was

296
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,820
but there are several sub-categories and the person so we split first two different sub-categories

297
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,560
and then

298
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,800
we do experiments

299
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,230
so far these these three different on dataset questions we'd and experiment

300
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,110
and then we come

301
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,520
after generating the

302
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,270
getting relationship graph we use different clustering algorithms like

303
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,400
k means and had to compare

304
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,350
a singer that performs better

305
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,680
so i've become benefit of baseline approach which is the x based clustering so we

306
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,600
get the

307
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,060
it's a pleasure the pleasure for me to introduce

308
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,860
cristina conati this morning

309
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,760
christine is associate professor

310
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:11,620
of computer science at the university of british columbia since two thousand five

311
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,530
her research goal

312
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,490
is two

313
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,650
integrate research in the official intelligence

314
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,720
human computer interaction and cognitive science

315
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:34,510
two may complex complex interactive systems increasingly more effective and about to the user means

316
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:43,980
harris interest including adaptive interfaces user modelling affective computing and intelligent tutoring systems

317
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,470
christine is the

318
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,620
outstanding c which she received a lower here

319
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,740
computer science minor can lower than at the university of milan italy in nineteen eighty

320
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,820
eight and then masters and ph d

321
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,680
intelligent systems at the university of pittsburgh

322
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:14,380
she has rich experience of research in companies research institutions universities

323
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,600
in italy and in the united states before joined the university of british columbia as

324
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,410
assistant professor in nineteen ninety nine

325
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:35,190
over the years cristina conati has received many awards and recognition for the quality of

326
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,430
research shows served as program committee and reviewer

327
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:47,870
four major a i in human computer interaction conferences tournaments she was program co-chair of

328
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,150
use of the user modeling confidence in

329
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,900
and also have seven

330
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,900
she's conference co-chair of i u

331
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:01,940
i this year international conference on intelligent user interfaces

332
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:12,410
over forty articles for a server said that paper she wrote a were awarded the

333
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,170
best paper award outstanding paper award

334
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,750
but is there

335
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,790
o taking more time out of representation

336
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:30,100
talking more of her research and achievements i prefer for it to pass

337
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:38,330
christina and let her percent radius in use on the new challenges in the elections

338
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:43,720
of intelligent tutoring systems thank you christina for your personal testing

339
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:54,500
graz jena for the kind introduction and things

340
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,670
o to the conference organisers for giving me the a chance to be here and

341
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:04,040
talk about intelligent tutoring systems to this very nice audience

342
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,600
so i want to start my presentation by

343
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:14,630
mentioning a seminal study that educational psychologist benjamin bloom conducted in nineteen eighty four

344
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,790
the effectiveness of the learning effectiveness of students that we're tutor

345
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,010
in a one-to-one fashion by humans instructors against

346
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,160
the learning gains tutors they received instruction in a regular classroom settings on the same

347
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:37,570
and the results that found was that the average student achievement in the one to

348
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:43,420
one tutoring condition was better than ninety percent of the achievements reached by students to

349
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:50,360
turn in the cluster this result is well known as a two sigma effect and

350
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,600
what is surprising is not so much the fact step

351
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,950
one to one tutoring turned out to be better than classroom instruction but it's actually

352
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,380
the minds of defect to respond so

353
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,890
this would say well then it's great we found that there was a great way

354
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:13,810
to make people learn by giving them individual tutors but of course we all understand

355
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:19,350
that having private tutors what instructors than can provide each of us one-to-one instruction is

356
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,030
definitely not sustainable solution

357
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,830
one option is to actually try to have the computers

358
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,900
provide some contribution towards this this final goal

359
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,360
and that's what intelligent to do research on intelligent tutoring systems try to do that

360
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,730
in today's system is

361
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:46,290
interdisciplinary field that combines integrates research in artificial intelligence human computer interaction cognitive science and

362
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,750
education with the goal of

363
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:55,470
creating computer-based tools that can better adapt to individual learners provides the benefits of one-to-one

364
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,980
instruction by

365
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,850
autonomously and intelligently adapting to the interaction to the specific needs of individual learners

366
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,540
so what i want to do in this talk is to provide some background and

367
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,980
basic definitions related to the field of intelligent tutoring systems

368
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:16,780
then i will describe some achievements of these fields up to now

369
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:23,040
and some new research directions and i will illustrate some of this new research directions

370
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,050
describing sampled rodgers' from our love

371
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:32,000
so let's start with a little bit of background as intelligent tutoring systems are not

372
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:38,360
the first attempt to provide computer supported aid to instruction

373
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:43,560
the precautions of intelligent tutoring systems are known as high system work i stands for

374
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,280
computer assisted instruction

375
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:50,310
and you can view this field as intelligent tutoring systems without the i components

376
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,060
what OK system does basically i'm going to try to illustrate how the were just

377
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,890
to give you an example of what is the cycle that cases to go through

378
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,470
system usually has the educational technologists defines

379
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,640
a curriculum as sequences of topics and exercises that the system that student should go

380
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,840
the case system just reads the specification

381
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:20,810
takes the current problem there should be presented presented to the student

382
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,370
the system also known as the designer has to specify all the correct answers for

383
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,610
exercises that

384
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,020
are given to the student so the system

385
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,720
get student answer

386
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,350
compares it with the known solution that is provided

387
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,950
and then

388
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:42,390
what is specified in the program is also what kind of feedback should be provided

389
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:47,800
for every possible combination of student answers and comparisons with the non status of computer

390
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:54,220
solutions and this feedback there is presented usually if the student answers correct usually the

391
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,400
student is advanced through the curriculum if it's incorrect there is some remediation given and

392
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,640
then again perhaps different that is specified for the student t

393
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:09,020
as you can understand the problem with these systems is that all the branching in

394
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:15,040
the programme for how the interaction should develop needs to be suppressed prespecified by educational

395
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:22,030
technology basically occasional technology needs to specify all the sequence table topics and exercises all

396
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:26,980
the relevant student answers that this is the system should be able to recognise and

397
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,980
all the possible to tory feedback actions that the system should take in response to

398
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:39,140
the solution process the system cannot understand can monitor the two dissolution process can only

399
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:45,400
understand the final answer and another issue is that usually the system doesn't know

400
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:50,470
i cannot tell why student is generating certain answers specifically for instance why is doing

401
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,660
is making mistakes

402
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,040
so this kind of approach

403
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,040
can be fine if one wants to provide

404
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:04,780
opportunities for students to do in practice activities on simple domains to chester instance of

405
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,730
basic math operations traction addition division

406
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:14,560
but it really doesn't scale becomes quite manageable if one wants to provide

407
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,230
i'd like to thank you

408
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,580
you evaluations they were very useful to me

409
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,600
i already send email to

410
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,630
about fifty students

411
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,420
and at some interesting exchanges with some of you

412
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,200
many of you are very happy

413
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,170
with their education structure that's great

414
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,790
many are moderately happy

415
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,720
maybe that's OK

416
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,830
but there are quite a few are very unhappy with the recitation

417
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:54,030
if you are very unhappy with your recitation structure you are complete idiots if you

418
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,340
stay in that investigation

419
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,510
we have thirteen

420
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,430
recitation instructors and i can assure you

421
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,860
it will be very easy to find one

422
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,040
that agrees with you

423
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,550
you can come and see me

424
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,120
if that helps

425
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:15,180
some are better than others that's the way it goes in life

426
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,160
some students

427
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:21,870
i would like to see more cut and dry problem solving in my lectures

428
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,360
i think that's really the domain of recitations lectures

429
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,510
and recitations are complementary

430
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,150
i prefer to go over the concepts

431
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,420
and i always give numerical examples to support the concept in way

432
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,700
that's problem solving

433
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,120
and i show demonstrations to further

434
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:46,560
the concept because seeing obviously is believing

435
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,950
i tried to make you see through

436
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,340
the dumb equations and admittedly

437
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,420
my methods i sometimes somewhat different

438
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,780
from what you're used to hearing MIT

439
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,920
i try to inspire you

440
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,230
and at times

441
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,360
i try to make you wonder

442
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,150
and think

443
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,840
and i want to keep it that way i believe that

444
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,080
hard probably problems problem solving is really the domain

445
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:14,030
of the recitations

446
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,830
many of you found

447
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,170
the exam

448
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,260
too easy

449
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,900
and many of you found in example too hard

450
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:28,570
some complained it was too hard because it was too easy

451
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,240
quite ironic isn't it

452
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,430
they say we want more mass

453
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,520
we want more standard problems

454
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,380
one more math i'm teaching physics

455
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,470
i test you

456
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,940
physics i don't consume activities

457
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,070
if you digest the homework

458
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:51,620
and that's very important you make the homework part of your culture

459
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,800
to study the solution

460
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,180
the solutions that we put on the web today four fifteen

461
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,350
solution to know before we go on the web

462
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:04,310
believe me they are truly excellent solutions not cut-and-dried to give you a lot of

463
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,870
if you digest those solutions

464
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,070
then the concepts will sink in

465
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,150
and now

466
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,780
two fifteen minutes

467
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,150
if you really want

468
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,000
which are complicated math

469
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,250
clearly not

470
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,820
i could try that next exam

471
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,810
but then i may have to buy myself

472
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,000
a bullet proof vest

473
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,030
to be safe

474
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,130
is what matters

475
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,410
well i gave my exam review here i highlighted the concept of these little problem

476
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,840
that i decided he was extremely simple

477
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,430
they were not so simple

478
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,030
but from that point of view

479
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,300
clearly i cannot cover all the subject in the fifty minute exams i have to

480
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,500
make a choice

481
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,530
so your preferred

482
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,090
topic may not be there

483
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:05,440
some of you think that the pace of this course is too slow

484
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,870
some of you think it's too fast

485
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:12,780
the score of the average score was three point eight

486
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,000
four point zero would have been ideal twenty one we could do

487
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,430
i can accommodate

488
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,940
all of you those who think it's too slow

489
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,250
and those who think it's too fast

490
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:25,250
three point eight is close enough to ideal for me

491
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,810
four point zero

492
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,840
and so

493
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,400
i have to leave it the way it is besides that

494
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,550
keep in mind

495
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,200
you are now at MIT you no longer in high school

496
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,120
now the good news

497
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,810
there were quite a few students who said the homework is too long

498
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,450
not a single person said

499
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:52,170
it was too short

500
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,300
i can fix that

501
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:59,430
i will reduce all future assignments by about twenty five percent effective tomorrow

502
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,440
i have already taken off assignment number five

503
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,290
two problems you down out to seven

504
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,640
and i will do that all assignments

505
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:11,050
that are coming

506
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,950
my pleasure

507
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,310
i'm going to cover was you something

508
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,870
that conceptually is the most difficult of all

509
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,750
of eight o two

510
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,880
and you will need time to digest

511
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,350
and if you think

512
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,770
what you're going to see is crazy

513
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,910
you're not alone

514
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,480
the only good news is

515
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,980
that conceptually

516
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,210
it's not going to

517
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,560
become more difficult

518
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,140
remember the earth's that in eighteen nineteen

519
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,600
discovered that a steady current

520
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,950
produces a steady magnetic field

521
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,450
and that connected electricity

522
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,310
with magnetism

523
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,450
a little later faraday therefore suggested

524
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,680
that maybe

525
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,810
a steady magnetic field

526
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,680
produces a steady current

527
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,140
he did many experiments to show that

528
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,520
now not to be so

529
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,390
and one way to try that

530
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,860
this is followed

531
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,580
he had here

532
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,210
battery which is which

533
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,980
and here

534
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,390
we had solenoid

535
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,670
closing the switch

536
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,850
the current will flow

537
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,810
and that creates

538
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:29,940
a magnetic field

539
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:33,370
in the solenoid and the magnetic fields

540
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,750
maybe it runs like so

541
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,140
on the right

542
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,450
and we do not true reflection

543
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:45,720
you can do that by reflecting the light of water

544
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,760
or the last

545
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,600
or plastic

546
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,650
or paint

547
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:57,000
metal bands light metals

548
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,120
you will not able

549
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,510
you will see later

550
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,800
that's indeed the case

551
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,110
so here

552
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,310
is a plate

553
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,000
and i have some lights

554
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,730
fall into place making nice people light

555
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,970
so might

556
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:24,870
we use these light guns for that

557
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,730
and so some

558
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,830
also want

559
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,890
nine people right

560
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:31,960
coming in

561
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:36,260
from some lamp here

562
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,580
used as a reference line a line which is

563
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,970
perpendicular to the surface

564
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,810
but they can use that for ninety degrees angle

565
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,080
this line is a reference

566
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,420
ninety degrees

567
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,950
it is

568
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,610
and we call this angle

569
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,290
in physics

570
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,730
so you may get

571
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,150
angle of incidence

572
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,900
if this is class

573
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,720
of all the last with exactly the same way

574
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:12,160
garden-variety class that you have only your windows

575
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,590
and if this angle is fifty five degrees

576
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:20,270
and the light is reflected

577
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,440
a hundred percent

578
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,950
not all why that is

579
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:31,390
but is hundred percent

580
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:36,160
this angle he was saying was that i was always the case

581
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,440
when light strikes

582
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,510
bounces off

583
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,260
just like a billion people

584
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,050
bounces off the edge of the data

585
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,840
we would say that the angle of incidence

586
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,670
it's the same as the angle of refraction

587
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,790
this angle is the angle of reflection and some of the light goes into the

588
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,030
in fact most goes into the glass

589
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,750
that is not

590
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,250
four this is really only the light and reflection

591
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,930
that is

592
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,250
on the percent

593
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,370
if you want to look into this light

594
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,180
so here is your i

595
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,890
you see the light coming to you

596
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,180
the light coming to me

597
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,180
all these unpolarized light coming to

598
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:28,060
like there might be some like like that

599
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,670
and the ensemble is on

600
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,040
if i look here

601
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,900
it might be

602
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,690
after this reflected comes up to me

603
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,460
now on the percent for rice this direction

604
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,520
i will demonstrate that

605
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,930
and the angle of fifty five degrees depends on a little bit of what kind

606
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,560
of glass to use

607
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,680
the difference

608
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,600
the larger to the smaller

609
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,500
if this is the water surface

610
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,690
englewood b fifty two degrees

611
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:02,710
which is not so different from fifty five to

612
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,950
i have here

613
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,910
they don't like

614
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,200
those of you

615
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,750
and we'll see if you're

616
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,500
and i can rotate that

617
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,810
i wrote like this

618
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,450
and here have light

619
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,340
so light strike onto this

620
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,350
piece of glass

621
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:33,100
i don't know about that

622
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,900
that's not going rise

623
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,450
so i will go in this direction

624
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,130
that is the likely to reflect it

625
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:45,370
you see it on the centre street

626
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,020
and i can change that

627
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,030
i can make the angle close to fifty five degrees

628
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,260
in which case

629
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,700
the reflected light will be

630
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,730
practically hundred percent polarized but i can make the angle

631
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:03,860
smaller than fifty five degrees lot more

632
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,270
and when i do that

633
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,940
we have a situation

634
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,640
that the light is partially all polarized

635
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,110
all right

636
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,390
what that means is

637
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,410
that always comes out like this

638
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,130
a lot

639
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,900
but there maybe also some like this

640
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,430
and some like that

641
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,630
and some like that

642
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:39,850
but if the dominant amount is in one direction we call that partially problem

643
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,370
if everything is in one direction

644
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,840
we call it a hundred percent

645
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,680
and that fifty five degree angle

646
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,750
it is very closely two hundred percent

647
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,740
the angle is not exactly fifty five degrees

648
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,240
so we're going to have this like

649
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,610
the first on

650
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,190
the light so they know doing

651
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,660
so when you see it shortly

652
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,690
make making completely dark

653
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,890
by the way you think of course that was you linear polarized

654
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,250
we will be able to see

655
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:19,180
the light that hits you is on the percent for the answer is you can't

656
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,580
the reason for that is that as it comes off

657
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,930
these spores

658
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,390
but when it

659
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:32,960
bounces from this screen back to you it politician so you cannot see

660
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,210
but that's why i have here a linear polarizer which encode all into be

661
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,520
so we're going to turn all the lights of make a star

662
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,620
and let's see what we can there is the light

663
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,040
the reflected light

664
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,140
and there you see

665
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,020
the light to go straight through all

666
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,580
i'm not interested

667
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:57,480
most of the allied activities goes straight through

668
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,040
only a small fraction

669
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,040
is really like

670
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,160
this is the light

671
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,180
that's reflected i can see it now

672
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,480
look into the reflected

673
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:11,710
so the angle is now not optimum i put the angle there somewhere at random

674
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,960
and i will show you the diff i hold this

675
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,980
a large sheet of all

676
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,330
into be

677
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,950
and if i rotate around

678
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:24,470
and this is what every rule uses right remember also in our mamdani controller one

679
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:29,930
regulation of the input variables for temperatures was actually that was car power small medium

680
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:34,550
and high each of the rules is the same as membership functions to to abandon

681
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:39,770
that five minutes each rule is free to choose its own membership functions allows us

682
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:45,290
to better model local properties and the reason for that is just saying if

683
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,030
down here

684
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:53,910
i have a lot of that are very very different

685
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:54,950
but actually you

686
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,920
this is a large area this is all

687
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,630
i don't know high output

688
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:05,640
and and you have no

689
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,950
no it doesn't make sense for the rules that describe it makes sense for the

690
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:17,070
rules that describe this this this effects down here to very fine renovation on on

691
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:20,350
that the x right but for the stuff up here it doesn't make sense for

692
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:24,970
me to have an equally fine international of x is you can just use one

693
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:29,910
large fuzzy set describing all this stuff you don't want to use a couple

694
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:33,550
that's the idea behind free fuzzy rules

695
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:38,430
and they also not going to use all attributes for rules in mendel automatically since

696
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,290
you have this global grid you're going to use all of the attributes for every

697
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:48,830
one of world's not going to do that are the reasons why do that obvious

698
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,870
it's an interesting and that's why i think it's worth this day

699
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:02,140
that's essentially what you're doing business the just go through that briefly i think at

700
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:07,370
the time it's also in the book if you can miss desire that would essentially

701
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,390
doing it's exactly our that goes through

702
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:14,870
all the training examples that you have and tries to introduce create new rules when

703
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,610
you actually need them

704
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,050
and similar to the higgins goodman our in the tries to look for the maximum

705
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:25,130
error then introduces new will there and just the rules and then it sees conflicts

706
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:31,350
so we'll start off in interface very then we don't have a rule that explains

707
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:35,270
the training pattern independent of training data just introduce a very general rule that just

708
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,770
says if true

709
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:39,730
then class k whatever this pattern belongs to right

710
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:44,520
this is what happens here if fall training examples of the do that's the main

711
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:48,570
if we already have a correct rule of class c that's what this pattern belongs

712
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:53,090
to classify right trying to build classify if you already have a rule that we

713
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,980
simply say well this was already correctly explaining our pattern happy so we increase the

714
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:02,290
main we just count how many pregnancies of the explain and just the core region

715
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:04,450
of the world so if you look

716
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:06,030
on these rules

717
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,220
i want to

718
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,170
if you sort of have a bird's eye view on these rules you can always

719
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,610
imagine what is having the core region

720
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:18,290
the building rectangular what's this is the relation to the rule fulfilment is

721
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:21,930
we are equal to one right and then you sort of have and the support

722
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,790
region around it

723
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:29,970
you just essentially looking bird's eye on top of an apparent pyramid with the chopped

724
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:35,430
to this is where the degree of membership gradually declines and here is

725
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:38,190
it on this area and we are just right

726
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:41,430
so this is the area where we have a degree of fulfilment above zero and

727
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,930
this is the area where the degree of filaments of one so much

728
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:50,430
but i mean what if a correct rule of class c exists that means the

729
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,930
pattern x lies somewhere in the support region correctly covered and now

730
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,970
in case it's not already in the core let's assume pattern x lies somewhere here

731
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,650
we'll just to adjust this core region a little bit

732
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:05,350
just it so that it also covers this pattern

733
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:12,230
the parents next that's all that's x announced and that's the case i mentioned before

734
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:14,730
if you do not have a correct rule get

735
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,990
or there's no rule around that covers this pattern the nice inside the support region

736
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:23,510
but just insert a new one which is the point so there's just one point

737
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:26,270
scorers the point x

738
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:30,790
and the support is in fact it's covering the entire just say OK this covers

739
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:35,830
everything you of course is nonsensical rule but it will be fixed in step three

740
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:40,310
which reduces the support of all rules of conflicting class the cover x so we

741
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:41,930
actually have will

742
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:46,740
terms of the VC dimension which is what people often state these kinds of bonds

743
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:52,130
and but we might as well stick with the only upon if you prefer but

744
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:56,870
people have evaluated VC dimensions for a number of learning machines

745
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,480
make sure myself and certainly go of people have been evaluated VC dimension them in

746
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,920
front of learning machines the neural networks and things like that

747
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:12,180
so it sometimes convenient to have the bound in this form

748
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:18,190
so let's wrap or wait for a second and think about what we have done

749
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,180
so far

750
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:25,250
so we started thinking about this principle of empirical risk minimization saying in machine learning

751
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,440
we would like to minimize the actual risk

752
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,620
the expected error on future test examples

753
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:38,050
examples that are drawn from the same underlying regularity as the training data we've seen

754
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:42,210
so we would like to minimize this quantity that we noticed we can't even compute

755
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:46,050
this quantity we need some kind of induction principle two

756
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:51,410
something that's close to minimizer of that quantity

757
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:55,450
the simplest possible induction principle was empirical risk minimization which said

758
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,620
after we have the training data so let's just minimize the error on the training

759
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,940
data and hope this this will lead us to a small error on the test

760
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:09,660
so then we analyse this empirical risk minimization conducted principle

761
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,090
it turned out that

762
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:15,790
this will only work if we have a certain type of uniform convergence

763
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:20,190
on the function class can be implemented by the learning machines

764
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,680
so think of the learning machine as a function class plus the way of picking

765
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,260
a function from that class

766
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:26,560
given the data

767
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,020
so we noticed

768
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,920
we can only do this if we have a certain

769
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,280
bound on the size of the function classes

770
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,960
we have a uniform convergence of

771
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,520
that will depend on how large clauses so we need to somehow measure the size

772
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,710
of the function class and it turns out that the way to measure the size

773
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:58,930
of the class in this in terms of capacity concepts seen several such things like

774
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:01,570
shattering coefficients grow functions

775
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,680
and these are mentioned and then we plug in the VC dimension and we get

776
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:13,750
on that tells us something about the consistency of empirical risk minimisation tells us that

777
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:18,710
we do in paris minimisation and we have a function class with bounded capacity then

778
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:23,510
we can guarantee that with high probability also test error will be not much larger

779
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,570
than the training

780
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,700
but now that we have this we could actually say well

781
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:33,210
why don't we actually directly try to minimize the right hand side of this rather

782
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:38,480
than only my minimizing this quantity and evaluating this quantity

783
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:44,100
and that's something that but in the intervening and i have of course also proposed

784
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:49,010
once they had these results and this is a roughly roughly speaking but i just

785
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,950
fix this quite useful structural risk minimisation

786
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:59,850
so most of the time people don't actually evaluate these bounds two

787
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:06,070
predict how well the learning machines will do so that's a little caveat for practice

788
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:08,780
because typically these bonds are quite loose

789
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:13,210
nevertheless sometimes the behavioral of response

790
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:17,940
as a function of the parameters that you're looking at it will be indicative of

791
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:22,780
what's going on in the learning procedure and sometimes you can use such powers as

792
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:26,890
modulation to design learning algorithms the balance can tell you

793
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:31,010
what kind of quantities to minimize in addition to the training error

794
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:37,180
in order to control the generalisation ability of your learning machine

795
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:40,000
so a b one more thing

796
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,490
might be useful because i remember a couple of years ago there was this big

797
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:44,960
discussion on

798
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:50,630
so maybe this about what kind of statement learning theory makes

799
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:53,090
some people were misinterpreting

800
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:58,560
statements saying that they guarantee that whatever the problem is that we are given we

801
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,910
can generalize

802
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:05,810
so in the way these sponsored they tell me tell us that whatever the problem

803
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:06,980
is that we are given

804
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,600
if we use the learning machine of small capacity we can generalize in the sense

805
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,940
that the training error and test error will not be two different from each other

806
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:20,600
however this doesn't mean that we can learn any problem so for instance if you

807
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:25,780
tried to learn the mapping from a name in the telephone directory to the telephone

808
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:30,820
number you try to predict someone's telephone number from the name which is probably very

809
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,370
hard task

810
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,320
then you would find that either you

811
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:38,450
i have to use learning machine

812
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:40,880
which has a very high capacity

813
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,590
so if you say you can take telephone directory you will need to very high

814
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:50,730
capacity to memorize all these telephone numbers in your learning machine in this case is

815
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,810
reconciled be very large bond will not

816
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:59,930
tell you anything non-trivial or use learning machine with a small capacity but then you

817
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:03,840
will find that you won't be able to achieve a small empirical research on this

818
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,710
problem so in this case this term here will be large so you won't be

819
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:12,500
able to cheat this would respond whenever tell you that you will be able to

820
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,940
learn such a problem in the sense that you will have a small test error

821
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,020
it only tells you that you can learn the proper in the sense that test

822
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:24,000
and training are are not too different from each other these statements are relative to

823
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,930
the training error

824
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:32,860
and it's also a big difference between these statements and a lot of things like

825
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:35,940
minimax results that have been done in statistics

826
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:39,490
they don't have is relative to the training and i think that's one of the

827
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:44,780
things of learning theory that these statements have this form

828
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,680
so now i told you that

829
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:58,510
it's important for machine learning to find a good function class is you need function

830
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,730
which has a small capacity

831
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:05,520
the brightest part of the car is the reflection of a window which normally you'd

832
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,820
expect to get dockery of the can

833
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:11,760
so anything that says OK when does the doc is going to fail and that

834
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,520
kind of thing

835
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,380
and then

836
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:19,080
if x to deal with scale

837
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:26,030
so it is natural images kind of forests and things that people sometimes partially cleared

838
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:26,880
one another

839
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,230
this is the person here

840
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:33,330
the people change in scale and if you move this person here down to here

841
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:37,840
know things things are really coherent

842
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:42,280
but you still sets the person of the person to take to protect find person

843
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,460
but it's not coherent with the same

844
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:47,890
so you could easily find false alarm like that

845
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,680
and in the same the famous scene from cyc physics and how many people have

846
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,520
managed to understand what's missing it

847
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,700
put your hand up here

848
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,690
i see from your singapore

849
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:03,520
but it normally takes people

850
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:07,640
you know the seconds also to figure out the first time they see exactly what

851
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:12,720
and as far as recognizing that kind of thing

852
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:16,090
we can can can do

853
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:18,330
is everyone now knows that this is the dog

854
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:23,330
OK just

855
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,090
if you choose the wrong scale things

856
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:30,080
you can get very wrong answers

857
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,950
so now interesting properties of human vision

858
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:38,180
and the reason for talking about these just

859
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,710
to kind of give the feeling for the

860
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,160
kinds of things human vision does

861
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,540
maybe is hence to the kinds of things we might want to do with it

862
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,640
when extracting features from images

863
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,770
human vision

864
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:55,100
it's very very large research field in its own right

865
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,400
it's very complex it's very difficult to get clear

866
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,320
results up from many things

867
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:05,210
i would say that really at the moment only the first few stages of visual

868
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,310
processing really well understood

869
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:12,080
and even then know well-understood was disqualified

870
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,840
but nevertheless there are some valuable less lessons there

871
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:21,770
there's a couple of points which seem very critical first of all almost all the

872
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,070
you get when you get into your brain the coded differentially so they contrast with

873
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:33,690
respect to something else so if you're doing intensity decoding its local contrast

874
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,410
using some kind of spatial

875
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:41,910
the fringe difference in type filters all spatiotemporal filters because also motion is called differentially

876
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:50,400
so there's this various types of the center surround baffles installed filters velocity filters

877
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:52,600
is code in an opponent way

878
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:56,030
so that means that instead of just having red green and blue

879
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,040
pixels or what you might have in your

880
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,480
brain having some kind of the difference signal

881
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:06,010
which allows you to colour constancy so this room in sunlight

882
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:10,020
you wouldn't have the difficulty of telling the difference between this room and sunlight in

883
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,760
this room and fluorescent lighting

884
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:15,720
but if you work on absolute colour you would have difficulty because the lighting is

885
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:20,970
different colour temperature and things like that different surfaces have slightly different colours so you

886
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:24,480
can you can be mistaken and if you're trying to do things like take skin

887
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,470
and images

888
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:29,580
which scanners around characteristic distribution intensity of colour

889
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:33,910
but it varies a lot with the lighting so you need to correct for that

890
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:36,080
so colour coding

891
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:37,240
and then

892
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,460
at all

893
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,620
both spatially so within the image

894
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,950
and also temporarily over time

895
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:50,480
this accommodation processes the run kind of building differences in contrast to make you used

896
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,320
to stuff that you see that you didn't really want to see so we can

897
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,580
focus on stuff that's new and this was just happening right now OK so we'll

898
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,680
see a few examples of that in the next slides

899
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,350
basically everywhere

900
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,650
the responses to compressive so

901
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,650
if you signal coming in

902
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:14,630
typically the signal has very large dynamic range may have extreme peaks like specularities very

903
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:18,820
the first step in the period

904
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:22,530
this is simply that people

905
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,150
the incoming messages just below

906
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,200
so this one

907
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,090
this it simply multiply the

908
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:35,380
you can show

909
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,320
exact marginals

910
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,010
and this is this is

911
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,450
message passing which

912
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:44,490
OK computer matching

913
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:50,670
the influence of tree structured graphs

914
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:56,200
this a similar system in

915
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:00,570
this trick is not to work because it's was complicated models

916
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:03,430
so just as humans quickly

917
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,800
so if it doesn't

918
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:08,680
the key

919
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:13,400
solutions just go interesting

920
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:19,380
for the last few days what this is is just

921
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:23,070
the distribution of taxes and disease

922
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,130
these axes of disease

923
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:32,930
you know you know this is and is is exactly this graph

924
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:34,970
this is

925
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:37,180
if you look wikipedia

926
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,780
this things is

927
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,900
this and i will

928
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,780
because of the sum of the two

929
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:57,820
this is exactly a special case of talking about the centre of so this

930
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:00,780
this is going to

931
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:04,280
this is just

932
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,070
that cannot be efficiently computed the of the solutions

933
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,930
shows what is to be what happened me

934
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,880
i mean you can compute that

935
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,470
that's quite small

936
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:24,020
using featuring so you know if it is essentially to all of this

937
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,340
the second thing and this is known as the kalman filter

938
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:34,260
so he discovered several times in the past

939
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:40,300
so as with many extensions and so this is the basic

940
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:47,200
in the sixties and seventies competition for the nineteen eighties

941
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,150
instances of this

942
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:07,610
as an example of a problem with this expensive school history and a problem

943
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:12,030
so differences and this and you can look at this

944
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:17,880
so this was in nineteen seventy two

945
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:21,070
see these

946
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:25,380
have to understand this structure these things it's

947
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:36,260
this seems to functions question

948
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,760
the message

949
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:53,760
so so if if it's not as if you like this fact

950
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,820
next step is the next step use

951
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,380
these messages

952
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,730
of course i those once

953
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,080
and i want to the set of nodes so that

954
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:10,180
my left child is labeled by a

955
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:15,500
my right is also labeled by a

956
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:28,630
because this is the first iteration of

957
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:30,280
if you don't like this

958
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:32,520
you can write it

959
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:35,420
zero one

960
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:47,080
you must be labelled by a you must also have

961
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:50,180
both child labor a

962
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:54,050
and so on which means that your level by a human have both shown labelled

963
01:00:56,070 --> 01:01:00,330
and the child the children must also have children both children labelled by and so

964
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:02,420
on so is basically

965
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,450
set of nodes where

966
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,870
whichever path

967
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,130
you start from

968
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,660
the path is

969
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,760
labelled by a all along

970
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:15,350
so this is exactly this form which says

971
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,080
four but i can be considered

972
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:25,330
this that is globally living by a

973
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,980
so you already have good patterns in the calculus

974
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,090
and now we're going to mix

975
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:39,170
and this is a bit mean more difficult to understand what

976
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,950
what they say is that

977
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:45,730
remember that with this new y

978
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:52,110
i could manage to say that

979
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,660
i have fourth and pb share

980
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,910
it's the title so

981
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,190
during the way

982
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:05,450
mu gives you find computations was something that all must hold eventually

983
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,880
but on the computation

984
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,220
and you

985
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,540
gives you let's infinite computations was something

986
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,120
is something environment

987
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:17,500
if you have this feeling

988
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,520
i'm not so good performance here but

989
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,940
here with the new hudson

990
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,080
g like

991
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:26,100
globally something

992
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:28,910
and we knew have f

993
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:32,000
eventually some that's that's the idea

994
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,060
so here

995
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:36,540
if you remember that

996
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,250
there exists a path

997
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:42,460
something happened of infinity of fun

998
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:46,810
do not try to you find in here

999
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:52,830
nineteen ninety and it's very simple to write infinitely often

1000
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:54,290
you say that

1001
01:02:55,100 --> 01:03:03,140
you always eventually i mean you always eventually he be

1002
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:07,020
that's the additive formula

1003
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,600
so wherever i go

1004
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:14,000
in the future when he'd be

1005
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,480
what am

1006
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:21,060
that's been now or in the future i go to the future it might be

1007
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,790
and i make one one more step one again i will eventually which beat so

1008
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:27,960
this is infinite graph

1009
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,180
so this is

1010
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:32,500
the standard notations of these ones

1011
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:34,960
and i can tell you there exist a path

1012
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,910
well he's he's

1013
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,890
in favour of

1014
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:43,000
so in the mu calculus that is to say that they have something which is

1015
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,040
globally true

1016
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:48,520
and this thing is the property which is

1017
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,270
some eventuality

1018
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:55,790
so the idea is that will kind of nests of greatest

1019
01:03:55,810 --> 01:04:00,140
and at least fixpoint because it's a combination of the two things have explained before

1020
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,480
so what is the combination of k

1021
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,250
i write my pattern

1022
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:08,390
which says OK

1023
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:12,370
you have to have two so if i say

1024
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,330
there exists something which is globally true

1025
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:16,890
let's call it

1026
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:20,520
and c would be

1027
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:22,310
something like this

1028
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:28,250
what fossil again how qubits that

1029
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:35,420
that means that this doing this way so here

1030
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:43,230
if you want to say that there exists something which is only true

1031
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,920
so this something

1032
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:50,120
it's very difficult to explain this one just on the basis of the two previous

1033
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,190
ones explain but let's try so

1034
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:54,690
the idea is that

1035
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:59,230
and i'm tracking this laser and i'm trapping and this will get you down to

1036
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:02,590
kelvin bit lower so

1037
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:06,040
and of course what i mean by lowering the temperature is

1038
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:08,900
you know i slowed down

1039
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:13,620
the temperature of the gas is related to

1040
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,600
how best to the moving

1041
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:19,230
by slow it down on cooling the air

1042
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,670
here is the first step

1043
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:29,030
and getting the atoms to condense the first step in cooling the down

1044
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,600
then there are many others

1045
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,460
and actually

1046
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:38,060
people design and one of the individuals who

1047
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:42,700
accomplished that feat is right here in the physics department one of my colleagues wolfgang

1048
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:47,580
can generally many of you you will get to meet wolfgang header picked you might

1049
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:50,210
even be teaching the section they don't want

1050
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:57,750
recitation OK alright great maybe i'll tell you more about it if you haven't already

1051
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:00,790
all right so

1052
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:05,520
both the home and some

1053
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:08,180
so now what we saying

1054
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:13,200
what we're saying is that radiation exhibits both

1055
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:18,010
the wavelike behavior and the particle like behaviour

1056
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,930
and just in general

1057
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:27,860
where the radiation produces the change in matter like the photoelectric effect that the change

1058
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:32,640
in manner right the electron gets ripped off of the material

1059
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:34,900
experiments in which the change

1060
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:38,270
in the matter is affected

1061
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:43,610
in that case usually the radiation exhibit particle like behaviour

1062
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:51,490
experiments in which the radiation interaction results in a change in the spatial distribution of

1063
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:52,840
the radiation

1064
01:06:52,850 --> 01:07:00,270
well in that case then radiation exhibit it wavelike behaviour

1065
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,020
and so

1066
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:02,110
you know not

1067
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:06,180
really a proper question appropriate questions

1068
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,100
it ask whether light

1069
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,980
the particle

1070
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:12,390
or is it away

1071
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:20,260
the appropriate question is is it ask whether light behaves like a particle or behaves

1072
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,820
like a wave

1073
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:27,020
depending on the particular experimental conditions

1074
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:32,650
this kind of wave particle duality with the ability of it to behave like a

1075
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:36,620
wave or a particle is not a contradiction

1076
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:40,010
it's just the fundamental nature of life

1077
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:43,750
it might seem like a contradiction to you

1078
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,180
because you're everyday experiences

1079
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:49,140
doesn't allow u

1080
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:55,250
we that both properties can be you're everyday experiences of the particle

1081
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,840
were it away

1082
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,350
but this is a part of the

1083
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:05,670
the nature of our world that you don't have any experience with every single day

1084
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:09,640
so it seems strange but it is the way

1085
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:11,610
white work

1086
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:15,860
like someone asked me what is the more of the full

1087
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,380
and when you ask a question that's fine but you have to realize what you

1088
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:23,680
want for an answer is to draw an analogy

1089
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:29,350
that photo is something that you can experience every day

1090
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:34,160
the bottom line is you can draw the analogy correctly because

1091
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,460
the photon is

1092
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:45,230
that you can relate correctly two-year everyday experiences the different parts of nature is just

1093
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:48,960
one that you don't see every day which seems strange

1094
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:51,080
so you have to be

1095
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,860
you have to be willing

1096
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:57,100
two it's that kind of new rules new phenomena

1097
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:00,490
there are just outside of your everyday experience

1098
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,810
we're out there as you delve into nature

1099
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:04,720
the more

1100
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:08,700
these will be to the torah lectures on convex optimisation

1101
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:15,270
most of the material in these lectures is developed together with stephen boyd stanford

1102
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,340
this part of the book and then also as part of

1103
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:26,260
slides from different courses at UCLA and also stephens courses at stanford

1104
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:29,560
i'd like to start with

1105
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,510
just some general introduction

1106
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,610
to explain why convex optimisation convex so important in

1107
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:45,630
i think everyone's familiar with the general mathematical optimisation problem of minimizing some non linear

1108
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:47,840
function of n variables subject to

1109
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,920
several nonlinear

1110
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:52,820
inequality constraints

1111
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:58,660
we call this a mathematical optimization problem or nonlinear optimization problem

1112
01:09:58,670 --> 01:09:59,990
it's extremely general

1113
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:05,140
it's a general model of could be any design problem or decision problems

1114
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:06,920
estimation problem

1115
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:11,220
it's extremely general is almost universal

1116
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:14,450
in applicability

1117
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:19,160
theory in practice of course there are limits to what you can do with mathematical

1118
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,690
and basically there are determined by the answers to these two questions

1119
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:28,440
first is only mathematical model of some

1120
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:35,170
actually optimisation problem so it's only useful if the mathematical model is sufficiently accurate

1121
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:41,550
as also very important optimization is the accuracy of the data that describe the model

1122
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:43,690
that are needed in the model

1123
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,830
so because in practice often this

1124
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,610
substantial uncertainty in the parameters that describe the model

1125
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:55,280
and that's since we in this optimisation optimize

1126
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:58,000
assuming certain parameters

1127
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:02,470
any uncertainty in the problem can have comedians are very sensitive to

1128
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,530
small changes in the data

1129
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,030
and second of course this

1130
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:10,440
it's one thing to write down the mathematical problem it's not to solve it so

1131
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:15,290
the question is can we actually solve the problem by existing methods

1132
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:16,210
and then that

1133
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:17,280
leads to two

1134
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:20,180
so the main activities and optimisation research

1135
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:20,960
one is

1136
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:23,650
people in optimisation goal modelling

1137
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:26,500
and then we are trying to formulate a generic

1138
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:35,850
before formulating optimisation problems and applications for example generic methods for dealing with uncertainty in

1139
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:41,130
optimisation problems not just in machine learning also control or circuit design

1140
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:45,810
and saying of course this research on algorithms that tries to expand

1141
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:48,130
class of problems that can be handled

1142
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:53,600
scale of the complexity of the problems that can be handled in practice

1143
01:11:53,650 --> 01:12:00,710
convexity is important because it's central concepts and sort of modeling and algorithms

1144
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,260
so we see that roughly speaking

1145
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,790
convex optimisation problems are

1146
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:10,630
roughly speaking the optimisation problems that can be how efficiently that are tractable

1147
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,040
and at the same time there was

1148
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:20,030
quite general and it's class of problems sufficiently rich to to be useful in practice

1149
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:22,910
so that's the reason why convex these

1150
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:25,980
such an important topic

1151
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:33,380
the as i mentioned the general optimisation problem unfortunately is intractable

1152
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:38,560
we don't know algorithms for solving the general nonlinear optimization problem

1153
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:41,750
and that's unfortunate but that's just the fact

1154
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:43,750
and please you

1155
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,040
for people who are new to this area

1156
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:48,250
it's often too that even simple

1157
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,930
optimisation problems

1158
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,150
can be

1159
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:55,130
very hard to solve

1160
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,820
two examples of that are for example quadratic optimisation so we know that if a

1161
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:03,620
quadratic optimisation problem with no constraints it's very easy to solve is that it is

1162
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:07,960
equal to zero you get a set of linear equations that you can solve to

1163
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,440
get cancer

1164
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:14,560
as soon as you add constraints quadratic optimising quadratic constraints it becomes much harder

1165
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:18,030
with one inequality constraints or one concept can still be

1166
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:21,150
solved efficiently it's more involved but they can still

1167
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,830
be solved efficiently but as soon as you have several

1168
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,420
constraints it becomes very difficult to solve

1169
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:28,850
another example is

1170
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,980
polynomial optimisation so

1171
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:34,300
if you are just interested in minimizing and

1172
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:36,280
polynomial in one variable

1173
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:38,800
we can just take the derivative

1174
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:40,640
it is also polynomial

1175
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:46,040
compute the roots of the derivative and find one that defines you

1176
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:50,120
it as soon as we have more than several variables it becomes also very difficult

1177
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,170
to minimize

1178
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:58,220
so in general you have to visit the down on the problem is difficult to

1179
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:04,470
solve the is one of well-known and famous exception that's the linear programming problem

1180
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:08,120
it's a special case when the objective and all the constraints are linear

1181
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:11,870
it was introduced by a

1182
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:16,910
six or concept formulated and practical method for solving it in the nineteen forties that

1183
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:19,110
the simplex method

1184
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:20,730
and then of

1185
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:26,220
that meant that so that i became widely known people started to use

1186
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:28,870
linear programming for modeling

1187
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:34,080
a different applications not just in operations research which would applications that dancing had in

1188
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:37,460
mind initially but also many other applications that

1189
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:41,720
go beyond the applications he

1190
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:43,230
i intend to initially

1191
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:47,040
in engineering finance and so on

1192
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:52,540
so it's very easy problem to solve in in a theoretical sense there exist a

1193
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:54,920
polynomial time methods for solving it

1194
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:57,030
also in a practical sense

1195
01:14:57,710 --> 01:15:03,160
in the sense that it's easy to find good software for linear programming free and

1196
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:06,040
good software for solving

1197
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:09,040
linear optimization problems

1198
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:11,890
there is also extensive theory that relates to

1199
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:13,270
duality of

1200
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,480
for linear programming

1201
01:15:15,530 --> 01:15:20,600
one important point is no closed form expression in general

1202
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:24,290
but that's not really a problem because you can solve it efficiently in practice using

1203
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:25,770
numerical methods

1204
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:32,650
and so people with some edits have can be proved to have polynomial complexity

1205
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:36,640
and in practice people also solve linear programs with

1206
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:40,870
several hundred thousands or even millions of variables and constants

1207
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:46,350
so the convex optimisation problem is more general so here we have a non linear

1208
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:48,520
cost function on the constraints

1209
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:50,370
but restrict the problem to

1210
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:55,400
objective and constraint functions are convex that satisfies this

1211
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:01,090
that's all seem more about in a few minutes

1212
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:05,800
so this includes linear programming is a special case for the constraints are linear functions

1213
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,830
are linear

1214
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,900
and the properties are very similar to linear programming

1215
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:12,790
so the idea are very similar complexity is similar

1216
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:16,220
but it's also much more general than many more problems can be written in this

1217
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:19,340
form then you programming

1218
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:22,760
the history

1219
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:27,140
a brief history so it all started linear programming in the nineteen forties

1220
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:32,360
then in the nineteen fifties for a while the development followed in more less predictable

1221
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:36,350
path so first extension of people considered as quadratic programming

1222
01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:37,340
and which

1223
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,600
replace the linear objective with a quadratic function

1224
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:46,530
and a quadratic programming keep the constraints linear

1225
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:49,190
for each

1226
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:54,470
one of the brain that we want to me

1227
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,510
you know exactly

1228
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:51,230
OK so

1229
01:17:55,990 --> 01:18:00,030
well what features

1230
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:03,820
and recycle their you

1231
01:18:06,030 --> 01:18:11,300
she was one of

1232
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:30,840
we're want to show the i wrote

1233
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:58,900
with what

1234
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:09,900
you get

1235
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:26,130
you have a lot of

1236
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:27,920
after that

1237
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,780
see that

1238
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,460
you know

1239
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,900
so we have

1240
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:53,380
we need to give some to model

1241
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:57,230
one of the most important

1242
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:26,070
and you

1243
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:27,840
the will

1244
01:20:54,530 --> 01:21:02,990
what what what you really

1245
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:25,190
you know what

1246
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:34,300
what really

1247
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:28,550
they are

1248
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:41,460
one well i suppose

1249
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:49,420
but you you

1250
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:12,590
one of

1251
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:16,930
i decided to place the monitoring stations of the target two target two customers in

1252
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,170
social networks

1253
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:19,530
and then i see the

1254
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:22,170
targeting another person

1255
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:27,040
then you get another person this now we do me lot of bad news

1256
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:31,500
you can get private health no on the other hand if i wanted target more

1257
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,600
people and i can see the targeting the same person

1258
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:37,030
again will cover the same area but now

1259
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:40,970
the marginal benefit that would get these is it that i would like to cover

1260
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:44,570
the new people y here six OK

1261
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:48,980
so here are a part of the same person help you

1262
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:52,110
we have much less right

1263
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:56,970
formerly this property goes under the name of similarity it's also known as diminishing returns

1264
01:23:56,970 --> 01:24:00,780
so you can think of it as some kind of community analogue of concavity and

1265
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:02,440
basically all it says is that

1266
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,180
the gain of adding an old

1267
01:24:04,190 --> 01:24:07,260
it was small set high edit large

1268
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:10,800
and this is the part the destruction x y

1269
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:15,070
and if you go back to the original question of how to find influential blogs

1270
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,200
which blogs to read to be most up to date

1271
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:22,850
the idea here is debated each blog covers part of the blogosphere right blog covers

1272
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:24,350
a set of topics so

1273
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:28,080
just to illustrate what i'm showing you here is

1274
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:31,660
a set of blogs so each dot is a blog so and now i be

1275
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:35,380
like sequentially making one log after another so we thought when i think the first

1276
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:38,730
one this is the guy here i get basically detect

1277
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:43,190
i that all the stories about the detective so my daughter

1278
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:47,010
but then for example is the second log i think another block covered this part

1279
01:24:47,010 --> 01:24:49,910
of the blogosphere and then the third one which is here is that we are

1280
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:54,440
with these other parties before we call very late and so on right so the

1281
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:58,690
more i think each one covers a bit of space but the the benefits getting

1282
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:00,150
smaller and smaller

1283
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:04,220
OK and and the saw so for example if i decide to pick them blogs

1284
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:08,090
and is like them blogs that i would advise you to read really know pretty

1285
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:11,030
what is going on in the blogosphere

1286
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:13,590
OK and now if go compare

1287
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:18,740
i would like to and the war basically the fraction of the story catch without

1288
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,950
much has some other heuristics

1289
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:24,760
you can see the quite well so for example if we would decide

1290
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:29,920
to select blogs at random we do poorly if we will decide by the number

1291
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,530
of things which today is sort a standard measure of influence

1292
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:37,470
he wouldn't be able to do very poorly while our thing which means you go

1293
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:38,570
and optimize

1294
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,860
that's quite well

1295
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,990
and moreover i show you but we also have a way to make these

1296
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:49,950
the the very scalable so if i show you the number of blogs we select

1297
01:25:50,130 --> 01:25:55,800
is the running time exhaustive search which finding an optimal solution explore very quickly

1298
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,760
greedy scales quadratically but we have something to basically scales linearly with a very very

1299
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,700
small nation

1300
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:03,840
so in in

1301
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:08,780
this this optimisation some very practical in

1302
01:26:10,150 --> 01:26:14,240
just because they showed before this question so here is a different question with the

1303
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:18,260
same the same thing applies so now the the question the i have a city

1304
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:22,280
water distribution network so now these houses in are physical fights between the

1305
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,880
flow of the water flows so

1306
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:28,880
the end what we have is the data on how for example some contamination started

1307
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:32,450
his house how contaminations spread through the network OK

1308
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:37,170
and the idea is to place sensors in these networks to save lives protect them

1309
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:40,950
exist as possible so the idea is there is an epidemic starting here

1310
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:46,530
then hits my sensitivity and a reason why is like a very realistic problems

1311
01:26:46,530 --> 01:26:48,510
there are many people cannot

1312
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:50,550
and to make the whole story should

1313
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:52,670
again we can use the same attractor

1314
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:54,880
we developed as so

1315
01:26:55,300 --> 01:27:00,220
if if i plotted the performance of our algorithm was just like some heuristic is

1316
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:04,840
that could producer for example saying i concentrate on high population areas i place my

1317
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,740
sense randomly because you are quite well

1318
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:09,930
and actually there some competition

1319
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:15,800
i will be our approach called best and basically beat all these approaches

1320
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:20,700
done by national labs the sort of experts in this while our

1321
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,490
simple basically

1322
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:24,590
did not meet

1323
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:28,990
OK so now i i think the second one and they have some time so

1324
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:30,670
i showed this article

1325
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,880
everything is fine

1326
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,780
OK the slide thirty nine

1327
01:27:42,990 --> 01:27:44,340
thirty nine

1328
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:48,150
OK so last

1329
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:51,360
so what i'm showing the last but is basically what are the benefits of working

1330
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:55,150
with large and i show you three different so the first thing is that if

1331
01:27:55,170 --> 01:28:00,630
you like best hypothesis that this planetary scale so here i show some something something

1332
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:02,630
really don't six degrees of separation

1333
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:05,590
because you can there's is no one on the whole

1334
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:10,920
i thing that show is something about the network community structure people assume that nodes

1335
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:15,490
in the network group in group in this sort of by cohesive groups and i

1336
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:16,530
show you how

1337
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:19,280
what you can see start looking that large networks

1338
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:23,340
and the last thing i'll show you something some indication of web search sort of

1339
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:26,650
interesting how much leverage can you get from just looking at the structure of the

1340
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:29,900
OK so

1341
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,170
first the one thing

1342
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,340
so the question here is or

1343
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:38,530
probably all know this it's like

1344
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:42,630
you know this is numbers so it can be good experiment for game and so

1345
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:47,690
on and so the idea is we have small world experiment from the ground sixty

1346
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,240
seven where he gave people

1347
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:54,630
in nebraska letters send people in boston and the idea was you can only for

1348
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:59,720
about your let the let to your friend and i hope that eventually he spoke

1349
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:01,280
broken must

1350
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:04,720
and the question is how many steps does it right so i have the social

1351
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:06,450
network of the united states

1352
01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:09,130
this is nebraska in the master

1353
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:12,340
you can get you can assume you can assume that people look for is that

1354
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:15,530
this train two to reach the target in some number of steps and then with

1355
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:19,450
be another person in nebraska who sent the letter some other way to

1356
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:26,170
what milgram experiment did he created this sparking his papers

1357
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:29,570
sixty four such letters can into the end

1358
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:34,020
he kept the average which was six point two and does this is now known

1359
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:37,280
as six degrees of separation like an average find

1360
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:40,150
and any american inside six

1361
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,190
so we can do the same thing on a much much larger scale we can

1362
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:47,700
microsoft instant messenger social network

1363
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:52,050
that has two hundred forty million people all over the world and two hundred fifty

1364
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:56,650
five billion exchanged messages in one and it's like that by today

1365
01:29:56,670 --> 01:30:00,170
composer network out of this and they can

1366
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:05,030
create sort of the same experience so now if i'm showing i'm i'm looking something

1367
01:30:05,070 --> 01:30:09,650
similar to this is the distance the number of short number of that sort of

1368
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:13,170
probability of that this two people who get haart certainly does

1369
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:16,920
and the observation that you can make use for that

1370
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:18,760
it's a lot here so

1371
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,220
but newton

1372
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:25,130
i thought that the colours were pre-existing in the prism just

1373
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:26,990
separates them

1374
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,940
and this was his crucial experiment to decide between those two theories

1375
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:33,970
you see what he did

1376
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:36,780
he drilled a hole through the board

1377
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,740
and let through only the red light

1378
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:42,970
and put the second prism there

1379
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:47,850
and he wrote here three times he wrote it here

1380
01:30:47,870 --> 01:30:50,540
and also here and also here

1381
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:54,510
next bari at looks from the core which means

1382
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:56,300
the broken light

1383
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:00,430
does not change its color

1384
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,150
so this proved to new

1385
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,980
at least that time

1386
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:11,240
the light is the substance not a train of pulses

1387
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:13,980
what do you think that proof now

1388
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:18,420
the the light is a substance or trade policies but at least you can see

1389
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:24,310
that in terms that that was a crucial experiment really important experiment that's the kind

1390
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:28,410
of experiments will try to talk about in the course

1391
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:34,290
experiments are indispensable in organic chemistry it's an empirical science based on observation and that's

1392
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:37,470
why you have to take the land

1393
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,120
but so is logic

1394
01:31:39,170 --> 01:31:43,820
that was number three and number four the ways knowing logic is important too

1395
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:46,440
so i believe what i tell you here

1396
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:49,090
only when it makes sense to you

1397
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,440
don't just cram

1398
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:53,510
make sure it makes sense

1399
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,830
what if it doesn't

1400
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:02,540
now here's how to succeed in killing one twenty five and will take as our

1401
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:06,300
model science student samuel peeps

1402
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:10,380
how many people have heard of samuel peeps

1403
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,170
if you're going to a scientist

1404
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:15,280
what did you hear that

1405
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:21,590
but the association with and be

1406
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:24,820
right in this period right in the heart of the

1407
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:28,990
science growth but what you know in four was his diary

1408
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:30,620
which tells all about

1409
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:34,140
everyday life in restoration

1410
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:41,880
he was actually is the sixteen year-old present when charles the first was beheaded sixteen

1411
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,790
forty nine

1412
01:32:43,790 --> 01:32:46,370
now what's the connection

1413
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,720
you know where this is

1414
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:55,070
so anybody been there

1415
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:58,290
the world often whaley avenues

1416
01:32:58,290 --> 01:33:01,160
those are named from four three

1417
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:03,210
of the fifty judges

1418
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:06,520
the condemned charles the first to be beheaded

1419
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:11,070
and they were the only ones that lasted very long after the restoration

1420
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:14,060
and they last because they fled to new england

1421
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:20,510
and were hidden on west rock all these roads are heading west toward west restaurant

1422
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:24,220
OK so that's the time to the same period but he got his phd in

1423
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:28,570
cambridge and sixteen fifty four and a masters in sixteen fifty six and he got

1424
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:31,810
a good job he became clerk of the acts for the navy board which meant

1425
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:35,150
he was the guy guided purchased everything for the royal navy

1426
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:40,210
all the rope all the tar all the lumber and so on

1427
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:45,130
and on july four sixteen sixty two minutes the fourth of july but it's more

1428
01:33:45,130 --> 01:33:48,000
than one hundred years before they became relevant

1429
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:54,020
he writes in his diary by by comes mister cooper made of the royal charles

1430
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:58,270
of whom i intend to learn mathematics and do begin with him today

1431
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,520
he being a very able man

1432
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:05,150
after an hour's being with him in arithmetic my first attempting to learn the multiplication

1433
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:09,940
we then parted till tomorrow so here's a guy doing all the purchasing for the

1434
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:13,870
royal navy and he didn't know multiplex multiplication

1435
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:16,140
let alone vision

1436
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:19,860
but he worked hard at july nine five days later

1437
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:24,770
he's up by four o'clock in that my multiplication table hard which is all the

1438
01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:29,520
trouble i meet with all in arithmetic can do the other things pretty well

1439
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:33,940
a july eleven up by four o'clock in hard my multiplication table which i have

1440
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:37,940
now almost master of

1441
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,780
christmas right so six months later

1442
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:43,960
so to my office practising arithmetic alone

1443
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,930
and making it end of last night's book with great content eleven at night and

1444
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:50,670
so on the suffering bed

1445
01:34:50,730 --> 01:34:52,460
or a year later

1446
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:54,170
also use motivated

1447
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:55,900
he was diligent

1448
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,530
that's good

1449
01:34:58,180 --> 01:35:02,870
a year later on a sunday i below by myself looking over my arithmetic books

1450
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:07,860
and temporal so my wife arose and on and she and i all the afternoon

1451
01:35:09,510 --> 01:35:14,980
and she has come to do addition subtraction and multiplication very well

1452
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:19,160
and so i purpose not to trouble are yet with the vision

1453
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:22,650
right so we worked with the study part

1454
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:25,790
and that's crucial

1455
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:28,060
and isaac newton

1456
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:31,500
does they recognise this book

1457
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:35,850
right the mathematical principles of science natural philosophy

1458
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:41,150
but there's an interesting thing on the title page

1459
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,850
samuel peeps

1460
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:46,820
is the one who gave permission to publish the book because he was the president

1461
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:50,980
of the royal society

1462
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:55,380
now six years later peeps encounter problems with dice

1463
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:59,090
the reason was he went to coffee shops every night for dinner

1464
01:35:59,110 --> 01:36:00,810
and the gamble

1465
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:04,900
right people propose various kinds of bats and he couldn't figure out this one so

1466
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:07,900
he wrote newton for help

1467
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:12,310
so this was the problem that he wrote new in the twenty second of november

1468
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:15,110
so a has six dice in a box

1469
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:17,250
and he has to throw is sixty five

1470
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:21,820
ron right b has twelve dies and he has the following two sixes

1471
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:25,920
and c has eighteen dies but he has to get three sixes to win

1472
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,440
the question is whether b and c have not is easier task it and even

1473
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:33,040
like that is if the dice are loaded or anything

1474
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:36,380
who has the better bet

1475
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:38,400
how many people think

1476
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:42,210
that is the same

1477
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:43,940
don't be shy

1478
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,900
how many think it's a

1479
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,580
how anything b

1480
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:52,080
that's the

1481
01:36:52,090 --> 01:36:57,640
resonance frequency which we call omega zero is not exactly the frequency

1482
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:00,500
the response of the object

1483
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:05,350
is a maximum very rarely ever will that become an issue

1484
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:10,070
i want to show you now a

1485
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:14,080
transparency from your own book don't take notes

1486
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:16,290
this is from french

1487
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:18,040
you see here

1488
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:19,600
the function

1489
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:23,450
a but it is divided by a zero which is that have zero divided by

1490
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:25,840
so that's the amplitude

1491
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:28,580
four zero frequency

1492
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:31,130
so when you start off it's one

1493
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:35,420
the ratio is one by definition right because it's a omega divided by those is

1494
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:39,660
zero and horizontally psi omega divided by omega zero

1495
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:41,220
so by definition

1496
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,160
right here at the one sign

1497
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:47,300
is that point that i put omega zero there

1498
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:48,640
you seem

1499
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:50,730
various curves

1500
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:52,660
four different values of q

1501
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:54,520
and the one that i made green

1502
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:56,690
q equals ten

1503
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:58,150
and no surprise

1504
01:37:58,160 --> 01:37:59,530
that the height

1505
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:01,180
is at most n

1506
01:38:01,180 --> 01:38:04,490
because we predicted that it is a few times higher

1507
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:08,200
then the amplitude when we have low frequency you see indeed

1508
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,500
that the red one

1509
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:12,190
very close to ten

1510
01:38:12,190 --> 01:38:13,240
if you look

1511
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:18,140
at the one that has a mark q equals three which is this one

1512
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:20,880
if you look very carefully you may see

1513
01:38:20,910 --> 01:38:22,520
that the maximum

1514
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:26,530
eight shifted slightly below

1515
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:27,690
the value

1516
01:38:28,530 --> 01:38:30,010
which is omega

1517
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,910
only guys because you're but

1518
01:38:31,910 --> 01:38:33,890
even for q recall three

1519
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:37,090
the difference is insignificantly small

1520
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:38,900
and then at the bottom you see

1521
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:43,130
the delta function the face the domain

1522
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:48,560
object follows the driver at very low frequency

1523
01:38:49,810 --> 01:38:51,180
delta is zero

1524
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:57,350
resonance is precisely by over two ninety degrees very hard to imagine that we'll try

1525
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:58,490
to show it to you

1526
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:01,230
and at very high frequencies they go

1527
01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:02,220
like this

1528
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,500
they are a hundred eighty degrees

1529
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:09,400
out of phase

1530
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:12,450
so now comes the question how do you

1531
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:14,210
apply force

1532
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:16,830
a system

1533
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:19,600
it's nice to say that is the force but you have to think of a

1534
01:39:20,210 --> 01:39:21,810
that you can actually

1535
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:23,060
i do that

1536
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:26,650
and i'll just this because one case was you

1537
01:39:26,650 --> 01:39:30,950
and then i will try to demonstrate it also

1538
01:39:30,970 --> 01:39:33,690
if i have a pendulum

1539
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:37,330
and i want a force on this object

1540
01:39:37,390 --> 01:39:40,080
then i can do that as you will see

1541
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:42,330
in our work

1542
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:44,780
by starting to move my hand here

1543
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:49,090
you will see how that translates into a force on this object

1544
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:51,770
i move my hand i allowed the drive

1545
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:54,040
my displacement now

1546
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:55,650
this in inches

1547
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:59,630
not to force that is in inches

1548
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:02,960
is the pendulum

1549
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:04,090
the length l

1550
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:10,530
mass and this is the equilibrium position of my hand here is the object

1551
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:14,080
but i'm going to move my hand

1552
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:16,050
anyway at

1553
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:18,240
he calls at a zero

1554
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:20,500
times cosine only t

1555
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:26,220
that is the frequency that i decided i imposed that frequency on the top of

1556
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:31,200
the pendulum and the amplitude of my hands in terms of inches

1557
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,510
four miles or light years

1558
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:35,930
that is a linear scale

1559
01:40:35,930 --> 01:40:37,770
at the zero

1560
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:39,480
it's not for us

1561
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:43,160
it's not of forced displacement

1562
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:46,020
well i take a picture of one moment in time

1563
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,060
and what do i see

1564
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,250
i see that

1565
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:52,140
this is what the band looks like

1566
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:54,360
this angle is data

1567
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:59,040
the pendulum is displaced over distance x

1568
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:00,840
from equilibrium

1569
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:02,330
and the top

1570
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,490
is displaced

1571
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:06,580
the distance at that this is one of the following

1572
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:10,170
i am doing that i and there was my hand i can help with this

1573
01:41:10,170 --> 01:41:11,320
is where i am

1574
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:15,860
and this is where the object is

1575
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,190
i want to put in

1576
01:41:18,270 --> 01:41:21,060
all the forces that i would

1577
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:23,500
i'll move it up a little bit because i one

1578
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:26,200
i have a little bit of room for my forces

1579
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:29,000
o makes the legs a little shorter

1580
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:30,500
the object

1581
01:41:30,690 --> 01:41:33,920
user of

1582
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:36,300
there are only two forces

1583
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:39,350
on this object and that is

1584
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:43,300
which is mg

1585
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,260
and that's attention

1586
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:48,260
things are different because you have a lot of bloggers data you can see the

1587
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:50,420
interaction between the different bloggers

1588
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:55,440
the main challenge lies is in discovering communities

1589
01:41:55,470 --> 01:42:00,300
within these individual blogs based on interaction

1590
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:04,030
so this is different from blog clustering because blacklisting

1591
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:07,280
focuses solely on the action part two

1592
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:08,670
similar text

1593
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:13,090
blogs are closer together so the but this is different because you have your about

1594
01:42:13,090 --> 01:42:16,260
the interaction between different blocks not just the content

1595
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:23,710
so basically you have to do some are technically can link analysis

1596
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:29,730
this figure basically gives you a sense of communities are different bloggers

1597
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:32,300
so you can see different communities emerging

1598
01:42:33,630 --> 01:42:35,670
different bloggers as leaders

1599
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:38,280
the nodes and the leaders of the blogs

1600
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:39,880
and the different are

1601
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:41,420
blue notes

1602
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:47,940
the members of these communities

1603
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:49,920
so they said before

1604
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:53,010
researchers identify these code is based on two things

1605
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:58,800
links which is this really the network the hyperlinks that allows interaction

1606
01:42:58,990 --> 01:43:04,490
between the these different blogs and then begin to identify which communities from these different

1607
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,320
some studies by greenberg and on

1608
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:14,170
the study the community of the pages based on these interactions

1609
01:43:14,190 --> 01:43:15,740
by fienberg

1610
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:19,530
used authority in hopes who explore communities

1611
01:43:19,590 --> 01:43:24,360
quite extended the idea of for the parties including qualifications

1612
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:29,010
who identify all instances of graph structures that reflect these committee characteristics

1613
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:34,730
some people also studied contains content based similarity basically they used in in

1614
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:39,280
you see the what the bitumen transpired so many

1615
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:43,840
blogs so they can see all these blogs is related so it's an implicit link

1616
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:48,570
assumption between these blogs so once you have that you can establish that between these

1617
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:52,400
blogs based on some events and then you can again try to find out the

1618
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:59,380
community between the law

1619
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,550
some books they

1620
01:44:00,570 --> 01:44:06,070
also study the blogger behavior while descending the communities so

1621
01:44:06,090 --> 01:44:08,400
they it by using a blog

1622
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:12,300
thirty years of a so once so they defined

1623
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:13,990
the readers of the box here

1624
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:18,610
the offer blog site they give them a question and try to find out whether

1625
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:23,510
this community is this blog site is actually a community and there are actually having

1626
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:26,510
a community like environment there

1627
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:28,010
some of the research is the

1628
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:31,510
also studied newsgroups and discussion forums

1629
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:36,070
the fine whether to substitute their domain of blocks

1630
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:41,460
because newsgroups and discussion forums are also make blocks in terms of interaction with this

1631
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:43,800
user i mean that you see a lot of

1632
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:50,840
person to group interaction as compared to person-to-person interaction

1633
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:52,760
let's move to

1634
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:56,710
spam are issues in blogs

1635
01:44:56,710 --> 01:44:59,820
which is one of the major rising concerns and blocks

1636
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:01,440
thirty percent of

1637
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:07,070
recent studies indicate that thirty percent of these blogs are going to spam they have

1638
01:45:07,070 --> 01:45:10,110
a lot of spam blog spam comment

1639
01:45:10,130 --> 01:45:14,730
so and this is actually not a problem for the comments on the blogs which

1640
01:45:14,730 --> 01:45:18,880
is also as valuable as the blog post itself

1641
01:45:20,050 --> 01:45:21,740
some of the

1642
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:22,800
some of the

1643
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:24,210
blog site the

1644
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:26,490
don't allow any guest

1645
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:30,710
comment so they allow you to sign in so they don't have anonymous access to

1646
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:34,130
these blog site so data can prevent

1647
01:45:34,150 --> 01:45:38,210
show of spam but this really defeats the purpose of blocking because it is an

1648
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:42,650
open environment so they were want different actions

1649
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:46,530
so it's more like a problem if you try to cut the

1650
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:51,610
interaction then you defeat the was are a few old interaction then you

1651
01:45:51,630 --> 01:45:53,420
i have a lot of spam issues

1652
01:45:53,470 --> 01:45:56,960
spammers make most of their money by getting viewers to click on the ads that

1653
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,820
ran adjacent to

1654
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:00,710
their nonsensical text

1655
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:07,280
and again open standards and low barriers to publishing escalates this problem

1656
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:15,010
and besides degrading search quality and also things natural resources

1657
01:46:15,090 --> 01:46:19,400
some of the initial researches applied them spam link detection approaches

1658
01:46:19,420 --> 01:46:23,490
to distinguish between nominative pages and spam pages based on the statistical properties like number

1659
01:46:23,490 --> 01:46:28,570
of words have the length of words anchor text titles keyword frequency tokenized URL of

1660
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:36,150
and some researchers they use pagerank score to find whether it's spam and

1661
01:46:36,210 --> 01:46:40,630
there's also some works based its the blog post as a static webpage and then

1662
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:42,760
they use both content and hyperlinks

1663
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:47,470
information to classify with a blog post is

1664
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:54,130
spam or is not spam

1665
01:46:54,130 --> 01:47:01,010
but there are some differences between differences between web spam detection and spam blog predictions

1666
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:05,630
the content on blog site is very dynamic as compared to

1667
01:47:05,630 --> 01:47:10,470
that of the pages so content based spam filters not that effective

1668
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:15,260
moreover spammers can copy the content from different sources so

1669
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:20,050
you can't really see whether they are actually spam

1670
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:23,460
so link based spam filters can easily be beaten by

1671
01:47:23,490 --> 01:47:27,070
creating legitimate links to other blog sites

1672
01:47:27,110 --> 01:47:32,050
so there is some work which considers the temporal dimension of blog posts

1673
01:47:32,110 --> 01:47:36,880
and the propose self similarity based splog detection algorithm which is based on the characteristic

1674
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:40,380
patterns found in both blog posts

1675
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:44,930
given the model class you want and we were just going to use against process

1676
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:50,740
prior and we can choose any any casting process that we want to of course

1677
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:51,930
i have to tell you

1678
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:57,700
about ways of making smart choices about this will come back to that but formally

1679
01:47:57,700 --> 01:47:59,410
speaking we just need to specify

1680
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:04,320
what that gas process prior looks like an and parameterized in terms of mean function

1681
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:08,280
which in this case i just to zero again and the covariance function yes question

1682
01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:16,700
is the

1683
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:18,200
the thing to do

1684
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:23,680
so i'm sure this was a little little shorthand maybe a little bit too short

1685
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:28,650
for let's look at the likelihood function again right so the likelihood function basically says

1686
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:32,860
it's a product over terms and e to the term's has this form is interested

1687
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:36,240
in the square difference between the observation

1688
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:40,820
and what the function is doing at that point but notice that the total likelihood

1689
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:47,570
here only cares about what the function does at the locations where we made observations

1690
01:48:47,630 --> 01:48:49,110
OK and this is just my

1691
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:56,200
my very compact notation for the for the same thing is the joint gaussians centered

1692
01:48:56,200 --> 01:49:01,680
on the left values with this model

1693
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:07,970
OK and then we maybe we need the gas in we get improper priors over

1694
01:49:07,970 --> 01:49:13,990
functions so that will give the casting process prior and see what happens

1695
01:49:14,990 --> 01:49:18,570
what we need to do we need to compute the posterior we do that by

1696
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:22,410
multiplying the the prior with the likelihood

1697
01:49:22,430 --> 01:49:26,880
so now the likelihood is just just the regular gauss in here and the priors

1698
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:30,130
it's funny kind of and is infinite dimensional gaus

1699
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:33,990
OK let's just go ahead so we multiply to gaussians since we get nothing else

1700
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:40,300
get and unnormalized calcium when multiplied to regulate how since we get one of these

1701
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:40,910
we get

1702
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:46,590
the unnormalized regular workouts and if you multiply against in with one of these infinitely

1703
01:49:46,590 --> 01:49:49,840
large scale since we just get an infinitely large gas

1704
01:49:50,670 --> 01:49:58,400
informally this is just using the standard the standard way of multiplying together two gaussians

1705
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:04,450
and what does it actually mean intuitively know the posterior distribution is what

1706
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:08,400
it's said it's an infinite dimensional

1707
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,070
so what does that make sense

1708
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:15,240
well it makes sense because it's supposed to be a distribution over functions right accounting

1709
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:17,800
process is a distribution over functions

1710
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:22,010
like so we started with with with the random distribution or functions and then we

1711
01:50:22,010 --> 01:50:25,220
said well we now have some data that is telling us something about what the

1712
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:29,570
function is doing and also had gauss informed right we multiply together those two and

1713
01:50:29,570 --> 01:50:33,280
then we got this infinite dimensional gas here

1714
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:36,340
so now what so how do we actually use this thing right we use the

1715
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:38,470
thing to make predictions

1716
01:50:38,490 --> 01:50:41,860
and how to make predictions well the predictions are just an interval

1717
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:48,680
over the the posterior distribution or we just we just want to marginalize out the

1718
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:53,670
the values of f we interested in here right so if we choose a test

1719
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:59,030
point x star we say OK let's just marginalize out the rest of the of

1720
01:50:59,030 --> 01:51:02,630
the infinitely many variables and just look at the one that we are interested in

1721
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:06,130
it and then we do that by just throwing away the parts of the covariance

1722
01:51:06,130 --> 01:51:08,200
they were not interested in

1723
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:11,990
OK i won't drag you through the actual out properties of this is the only

1724
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:16,050
thing which is going on it and when you get the predictions the predictions here

1725
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:20,470
i just comes down to this one dimensional gaussians has meaning

1726
01:51:20,610 --> 01:51:25,300
which is the number in this case it's vector times the matrix times that here

1727
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:28,650
and they can be the variance is just a number

1728
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:31,240
OK so it's just a one-dimensional

1729
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:33,820
gaston distribution yes

1730
01:51:38,090 --> 01:51:38,950
that's correct

1731
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:48,280
OK so the question is i've computed what the what a posterior distribution over the

1732
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:53,360
predicted value is that a particular point but i was free to choose anywhere anywhere

1733
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:55,700
one right so i just computers sorry

1734
01:51:57,320 --> 01:51:58,400
we are here

1735
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:07,680
no this is this is the general this is that the posterior distribution over functions

1736
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:11,520
this is not a particular x here this is the exhibition just the just the

1737
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,650
just the placeholder

1738
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:18,510
this equation works for any value of x

1739
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:25,410
it is a gaussian process is a distribution over functions

1740
01:52:25,930 --> 01:52:27,510
but it gets

1741
01:52:28,010 --> 01:52:31,320
conditions for the very reason we have

1742
01:52:31,740 --> 01:52:35,010
go distribution

1743
01:52:35,030 --> 01:52:37,380
in your mind

1744
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:39,930
one person additional

1745
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:44,650
what the distribution of functions because you can choose to

1746
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:45,510
look at

1747
01:52:45,530 --> 01:52:49,300
you know what is the function doing any number of locations that in any number

1748
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:55,840
of locations the distribution of the function values are jointly gaussian that because the processors

1749
01:52:55,860 --> 01:53:02,380
but let me know if we take your question then i'm going to draw pictures

1750
01:53:02,410 --> 01:53:06,050
of what this actually means why because i would rather not so easy to digest

1751
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:10,150
significantly more questions that you will be

1752
01:53:11,970 --> 01:53:17,050
so this question about you know how how about how big is the matrix that

1753
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:21,570
we have to compute right and it's true that the matrix here is depends on

1754
01:53:21,570 --> 01:53:25,450
the on the covariance matrix here which has the dimension which is the number of

1755
01:53:25,450 --> 01:53:29,900
points square right so if have ten thousand training points then this matrix is a

1756
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:31,450
big matrix

1757
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:33,090
that's true

1758
01:53:33,090 --> 01:53:38,740
but it's not an infinitely big matrix right it only scales what scales quadratically with

1759
01:53:38,740 --> 01:53:42,700
the number of data points right so you want to use this for very large

1760
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:48,840
data data then you might not want to use this naive implementation so that's a

1761
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:53,400
very good point the most ago

1762
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:58,040
bad but when you look at these it's like proportionally there's a lot right canada

1763
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:06,300
has a lot  Scandinavia has a lot Australia here something

1764
01:54:06,350 --> 01:54:11,160
Greece Crete especially and so on but what is funny is then if you go and

1765
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:15,230
ask what is the so this is would be one of the few highest countries

1766
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:20,280
with the proportion of the population so thirty five per cent of the Iceland population logs in

1767
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:27,300
to microsoft instant messenger in june right and for example spain iceland Spain Netherlands

1768
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:31,800
Canada Sweden Norway they have like one quarter and these are the biggest so then

1769
01:54:31,810 --> 01:54:37,120
here's a gap france and UK have like eighteen USA and Brasil have like eight so this would be the

1770
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:44,120
fraction of the population that is actively using microsoft instant messenger in June two thousand six okay

1771
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:52,020
I think these numbers are quite high and then another visualisation is just about

1772
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:55,660
so here he idea is that you have two people talking so you have

1773
01:54:55,660 --> 01:54:59,580
have two points and now you just draw a line between them and increase the

1774
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:03,840
intensity along that that line so this would sort of say what are the main communication

1775
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:09,820
exits okay so so whenever there is a conversation from U.S. from Europe

1776
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:14,260
to yes you would like to increase the counts of the points on the line

1777
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:18,380
and now this sort of shows the the how high are the counts and what is

1778
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:22,660
this basically says is that so if somebody stalks Japan Japan to U.S. goes

1779
01:55:22,670 --> 01:55:26,200
here so it doesn't like wrap around but still you can see that this seems to be the

1780
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:31,660
main communication line I don't know how to explain this this makes a lot

1781
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:38,600
of sense right from from from Australia New Zealand towards U.S. towards Europe

1782
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:44,500
right here but I don't know why Brazilians would

1783
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:58,220
I don't know I have no explanation for this so another thing I don't know I lost

1784
01:55:58,270 --> 01:56:04,160
the title another thing that you can do you can ask is this so

1785
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:09,360
it's how similar people how does the I don't know some how does the similarity of

1786
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:17,420
age or gender affect communication so what I have here is for example this one

1787
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:21,100
is a bit easier to explain so  so the thing is if you take two people at

1788
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:24,980
random and you ask what's the probability that they are of the same age the

1789
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:29,380
probability of being of the same age is point three now if you ask from all the pairs

1790
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:33,080
of people that communicate if I pick two random random people what's the

1791
01:56:33,080 --> 01:56:37,620
probability that they're are of the same age or you say the same gender right it's the

1792
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:41,960
same then you say oh do they come same zip code if you pick random sets

1793
01:56:41,990 --> 01:56:46,500
of people they don't come from  zip kode if you peak from the ones that communicate that

1794
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:51,190
communicate it's much higher or for example for country or language again like here is very small

1795
01:56:51,250 --> 01:56:56,860
this is like I don't know twenty times larger or so  right so this is the

1796
01:56:56,870 --> 01:57:02,460
probability of the among if you pick two people that communicate how that they

1797
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:06,620
have they speak the same language and so this is in the terms of probability

1798
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:12,500
this is the correlation so now I'm asking what's the correlation between using the same languages

1799
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:18,480
two people communicate if I pick them at random and this this what this picture shows is if I'm

1800
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:23,100
picking random pairs of people then my age distribution looks like this right it's still

1801
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:28,040
peaks at these particular value because I have the most population here but it's

1802
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:34,160
sort of has no has no diagonal trend while in reality the you can see

1803
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:42,030
the diagonal trend upwards right which  basically means that the more similar you are in age location country

1804
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:46,460
language the higher the probability of talking to each other

1805
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:52,260
so now for the second part I want to show some properties of the

1806
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:57,720
graph right  as a so we have there are two kinds of graphs one you

1807
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:00,960
at least that you can create from this one is called the buddy graph where

1808
01:58:00,970 --> 01:58:04,170
you put all the people and there is an edge between these two people if

1809
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:08,760
if they are buddies on the network right if you if one has the other

1810
01:58:08,770 --> 01:58:14,120
in the coontact list okay and this from from the data you would have

1811
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:20,560
two hundred fourty million nodes and you have nine point five billion edges so this would be like friendship links
