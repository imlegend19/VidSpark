1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,370
OK which is

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,970
and is in the exponent

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,420
is exponential

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:17,080
and this the technical term we use something is exponential time

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,520
OK very

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,940
OK so slow

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,990
so this is really bad

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,100
take a long time to crank out

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,220
how long the longest common subsequence is because this so

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,670
now for the process of developing a form

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,350
fish now our this problem

12
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,250
russian go through several stages

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,070
the first one is to go through simplifications

14
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,470
already do

15
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,960
simply the link

16
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,290
one way or the consequence of x and y

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,140
and what do is expand

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,260
the longest common subsequence itself

19
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,530
these are all the allowing

20
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,230
to simplify the problem that he will just try to compute the length nice is

21
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,090
the length is

22
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,910
there's only one link is going to be the longest

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,550
well those

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,570
focus on the problem of computing the line

25
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,180
and what we do is we can back up from and figure out

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,970
however what actually is the subsequence realizes that way

27
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,570
and now we have big simplification

28
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,740
you have to attract a lot of possibilities every stage just have to keep track

29
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,710
the one number which is the way

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,630
this reduces it to an american problem

31
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,450
that the following

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,020
pretty standard notation but i just wonder

33
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:27,400
five per absolute values around spring denotes or

34
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,500
for a sequence of the note

35
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,150
so that's the first thing second thing we're going to do is actually working on

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,450
which takes a lot more insight when you come up with a problem like this

37
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,170
and in some sense ends up being the

38
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:02,580
the hardest part of design good dynamic programming

39
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,500
so for any

40
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,850
which is we're going to actually are

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,790
no rule

42
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,600
on some sequences x and y

43
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,600
we're just prefixes

44
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:29,410
just look at prefixes show

45
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,990
we can express

46
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,640
OK the length of the longest common subsequence

47
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,730
in terms of each other

48
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,650
in particular define

49
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,420
see if i j

50
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,540
to be the wang

51
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,090
longest common subsequence

52
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,670
the prefix of

53
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,510
x going from one to

54
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,670
going to one

55
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,400
around new is

56
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:13,270
we're going to calculate c i j for i j

57
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,740
and if we do that

58
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:35,570
the problem of longest common subsequence of x and y

59
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,090
we saw the longest common substring

60
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,610
i and j

61
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,760
then do we

62
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,080
compute the length of the longest common subsequence of x and y

63
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,000
SEM and that's all

64
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,930
the common man

65
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,270
just equal to the longest common subsequence of x y

66
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,010
this is

67
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,840
go from one to and

68
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,660
one day and on that

69
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,030
it turns out that what we to do is figure out how to

70
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,850
on express

71
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,470
five cm and general CIJ in terms of other CIJ

72
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:41,090
the idea

73
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,960
is just

74
00:05:44,010 --> 00:06:31,220
it's as if the i character matches the change character and see

75
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,540
i think you're correct matches character y

76
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,430
and see i j is just see if i missed one j minus one plus

77
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,380
they don't match

78
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,480
then it's easier to be

79
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,540
no longer

80
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,930
by june one

81
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,110
right usually the weight

82
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,270
the addition of

83
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,500
integers is denoted is with the symbol

84
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,440
but here

85
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,030
in group real and i just said that usually we denote the group operation by

86
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,130
multiplication so

87
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,800
x plus y becomes x times why this is i'm going to refer to experts

88
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,850
why i hope it doesn't confuse it too much

89
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,220
under the same identification between addition and

90
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,580
the group operation

91
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,540
continuous spaces also for group in particular the rios and euclidean vector space so this

92
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,770
is just the addition of vectors that also group this is the first example of

93
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,190
continuous group in so fact it's the only group that i can tell you more

94
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,790
about those sources

95
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,700
other examples of such continuous groups

96
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,480
other rotation groups

97
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,710
i should have

98
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:52,290
maybe i could have put this in the context of the icosahedron again because

99
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,800
obviously there's a finite number of ways in which you can capture the symmetries of

100
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,140
the icosahedron but they come from a larger family of all possible rotations of three

101
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,870
dimensional space right so that forms a group if you think about

102
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:11,730
i rotation as corporation acting in three-dimensional space rotating and somehow then you can combined

103
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:18,480
these operations and get further operations so again the groups of axioms are satisfied these

104
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:24,800
this group is called SOM because it's identified but

105
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,530
a set of orthogonal matrices with determinant positive one

106
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:35,250
in the best way to get so this is these are the rotation euclidean rotation

107
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,630
rotation groups

108
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,420
a slightly larger groups

109
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,230
is the group of all rigid body motions so future then just take rotations about

110
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,080
rotations and translations

111
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,120
but again the symmetry

112
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,680
it again forms a group

113
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:56,110
and the fact that euclidean geometry is nothing but

114
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,940
the study of

115
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,120
of objects

116
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,150
euclidean space

117
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,040
and this invariant managed to this group

118
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,640
let felix klein to make this very general statement

119
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,220
geometry is in general can be regarded

120
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,470
has just the study of objects invariant with respect to a particular group

121
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,560
so an algebraic point of view geometry is not you might think that the geometry

122
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,630
is about the lines and circles and points and whatnot but in a more abstract

123
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,940
all that's happening is that you have

124
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,370
a set of objects have symmetry operation on them which is captured by a group

125
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,030
and you are studying the properties of the the objects which are invariant with respect

126
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,670
to that symmetry operations

127
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,660
now the special unitary groups should be familiar to anybody who studied physics

128
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,650
because they are fundamental to modern treatment of quantum mechanics

129
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,450
i also must mention the general linear group which is just the matrix of

130
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,760
just the group of all invertible matrices of

131
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,550
the size and by

132
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,880
so in some sense the rotation group is the subgroup of this group right because

133
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,770
those are just matrices which are orthogonal and have determinant one

134
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,540
if you consider all possible matrices which you can invert so which you can find

135
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,780
the inverse then you get the general linear group

136
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,280
and finally there are

137
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:29,760
so you can continue the series there are lots of there are there are many

138
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,760
series of of groups that people have studied there are also individual groups that are

139
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,020
of interest for particular reasons for example this one

140
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:44,260
which is famous for its approach which you might not otherwise study if it were

141
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,720
in the symmetry group of rubik's cube

142
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:53,190
so if you are not sure how many of you have tackled rubik's cube

143
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,460
not sure if any of you try to group theory

144
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:04,390
if you were to do that and then this is the objectivity would be studying

145
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,930
this is not the only complicated group

146
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:13,680
things do you get a little bit here if you try enumerating all groups to

147
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:20,110
categorizing them and figuring out what the fundamental groups famously the largest group that this

148
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,940
simple in some sense

149
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,710
it has been proved to be the so-called monster group

150
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,690
which has this many elements

151
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:36,500
so from former mathematicians point of view what's what's fascinating is that captured is like

152
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:45,750
notions of complexity that is clear from simple simple of composite structures

153
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:50,710
you can come you can combine simple structures to get more complicated structures are the

154
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:56,140
best is what other the simple like the fundamental structures and you start enumerating then

155
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,100
you find these families like the symmetric groups for any and there is the symmetric

156
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,200
group concept corresponding to do that and

157
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,250
and then there are these are the ones which don't fall into any categories so

158
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,580
you look at those two and you find one in the other and we get

159
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,780
larger and larger and more difficult to describe to you think it might never end

160
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,860
but doesn't have a certain point although it takes a little bit of work to

161
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,780
describe something that is this page

162
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,970
it took about a hundred years

163
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,630
so that's justified

164
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,710
the the fearful part

165
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:38,860
before i get into the machine learning by let me just say how to

166
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,030
find a way in this universe of

167
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,520
groups of different types so some of the groups that i talked about some of

168
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,880
the groups that we're going to be looking at in machine learning context of finite

169
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,170
groups many since they are simpler than obviously

170
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:00,640
and then is the infinite and continuous groups so the cyclic groups fear the quaternion

171
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,630
group the monster and the symmetric groups are all fine

172
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,890
the infinite groups but there are

173
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:14,260
but some of them are countable so things national generalizes naturally to that case such

174
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,410
as the integers that's fairly simple

175
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,910
things get more interesting

176
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,450
when the group becomes continuous

177
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,600
and the subset the subset in which you can put the topology which matches the

178
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,290
group structure is the only groups so in the continues group round people mostly focused

179
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,030
on these groups in particular

180
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:40,080
the rotation group SO the unitary groups fall into this category the

181
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,280
the euclidean group so the

182
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,990
a group of vectors with respect to addition and rigid body motions are also lead

183
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,630
this is the effect is tendency thought was much more complicated than to polynomial so

184
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,990
it will capture that

185
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,340
variations capture the model

186
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,090
OK so so that the bias term if you make your model

187
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,490
more flexible and so if you do something like is neural network which is much

188
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,880
more flexible than a polynomial curve then

189
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,320
you can not biased quite a lot because you model

190
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,320
you can think of all the nuances of what's going on

191
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,510
over what people found is because

192
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,130
you have

193
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,300
this relationship

194
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,130
because you can really get mean squared error down below sea level if you started

195
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,360
reducing the bias variance seem to start going was so

196
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,710
so how do you solve various going upwards well

197
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,550
you collect more data

198
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,130
so this is

199
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:54,650
why this should be in areas of concentrate on in data mining because

200
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,260
we can reduce our variability

201
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,400
by using massive datasets

202
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,690
so we can get

203
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,090
to get small

204
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,340
we can also

205
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,510
we can also

206
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:20,990
complicated flexible models like trees and neural networks rather than straight lines

207
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,960
that will allow to reduce the bias

208
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,380
the problem that people had in the past was they didn't have a big data

209
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,510
so what was happening was when the for the complicated model

210
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,190
the very short because you couldn't get the data set

211
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,820
that's why

212
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,480
we should be moving

213
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:47,380
towards the end of towards the money into a wider we should be moving towards

214
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:53,320
these sorts of models because we have the data sets so that that's what i

215
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,400
wanted that to be included in that's the idea that this

216
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:02,320
these are two components to the error on model what is natural variation and one

217
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,900
is the model

218
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,070
you the wrong type of models we can address the thing the wrong type model

219
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,130
by making a set of possible models more complicated

220
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,280
and we can address the natural background variation by

221
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,940
collecting more data base

222
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,760
and that's why you don't want massive amounts of data so

223
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,320
so these

224
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,260
complicated method complicated models flexible models are becoming more important one part of the word

225
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,420
in the statistics community where they with small datasets

226
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,650
about it

227
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,320
there's one other thing i wanted so

228
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,070
talked about

229
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:59,460
sampling distributions not about something distributions is what allows me to make statements like

230
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,920
i like this

231
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:05,360
because if i know something distribution of all the quantities involved in these models that

232
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,490
i can say we have the variances is that relate to the bias and relates

233
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,440
to this

234
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,490
that is the sampling distribution ten about that's all want to say something about the

235
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,480
behavior of the model basically behavior but things in the model that i

236
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,300
i can't measure directly

237
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:30,710
traditionally these quantities worked out

238
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,530
basically by doing that by the probability calculation was started to happen though is

239
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,570
the taxable looking it of run off the end of what we can do classically

240
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,860
we can

241
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:48,570
the sampling properties of some of the estimate is that we get from say no

242
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,110
network because we can't even write down what is doing

243
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,030
so what

244
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,610
not in the days of the week after the mass anyway so an alternative which

245
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,590
we're here in order to get hold of something properties

246
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,990
we have an article resampling and

247
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:13,670
this is basically we do computer simulation to see what's going on and the resampling

248
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,880
idea is

249
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,090
that we

250
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,530
it's a kind of data

251
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:24,900
and use that as a source of random outcomes from a statistical model

252
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,940
so we repeatedly sample

253
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,960
from our data set

254
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:36,420
with replacement so we take one observation and and then they that that goes into

255
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:42,340
our resampling put it back in the sample against so that generate

256
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,990
multiple samples

257
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,880
computers and later by pseudo random selection

258
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:54,130
so around just because it's it's easy to compute to a random number rather than

259
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,960
real random number

260
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:04,630
what we can do then is generally what's of different samples that have the same

261
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,880
characteristics as our original data

262
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:13,510
and we can then investigate what are the differences between samples the variation across samples

263
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,360
is due to sampling

264
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,920
and these as an idea to estimate the

265
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,010
sampling properties

266
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,550
all things like the bias

267
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,760
other thing do this sort of thing that you might have come across cross validation

268
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,760
what do you do cross validation is

269
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,420
you a model is also called leave one out two

270
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,760
the you take a model

271
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,760
u fifty two

272
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,260
all the data apart from one of your observations and then you can see

273
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,780
say what does the model that fitted predict the outcome to be for the one

274
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,030
you left out and then you can look at the difference between what the model

275
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:55,860
predicts what you actually got that give you an estimate of the error between the

276
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,900
predictions of the observations and then you just what you to all the individual data

277
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,860
points leaving them at one time that we call cross validation

278
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,720
i mean it's given as an idea

279
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,210
well that situation is given us an idea of

280
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,590
this quantity

281
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,900
this gives idea of what's the difference between the

282
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,670
collected data the observed values and what the models predict in

283
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:28,920
but the things that people in terms of bootstrapping is

284
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,440
is another method of doing this six

285
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,590
i would allow to estimate

286
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,480
say well

287
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,710
the medians

288
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,610
some of not so immediately if you live in

289
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,920
data is in order

290
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,260
from let's same the smallest to the biggest than the medium is just the number

291
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,630
that's halfway along along is so the numbers with the fiftieth ward in order

292
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,670
so is the fiftieth percentile is another way of putting it so so half the

293
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,900
observations below

294
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,600
so let it sit there for the balance of the lecture and maybe at the

295
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,550
end we'll see some of the

296
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,030
liquid oxygen

297
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:22,310
OK so let that work and all you have are proteins we said there's palmer

298
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,360
so let's see if we can

299
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,820
do something with the with the proteins here

300
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:32,480
you put the rose roses you know they have glass flowers at harvard

301
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,690
at at a museum

302
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,280
five museum

303
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,110
we have glass flowers here at MIT

304
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,690
OK so this erosion it's very soft

305
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,970
let's go

306
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:05,400
it's not a kitten

307
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,670
and it only works on roses which do one more scabby scientist you know me

308
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,820
which is roses that do this

309
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:22,090
so let's look at this one

310
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,150
let's transition temperature

311
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,020
there is

312
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,360
OK so we get the going well at oxygen can condense and let's see let's

313
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,590
go back to the

314
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,090
computer think we're going to take a break and go back to some some more

315
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,320
learning here

316
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,710
OK so here are some

317
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,840
o thing and there is one of the one here i think

318
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,730
right so we've seen this and here's nitrogen with all of its different solid phases

319
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:57,090
nitrogen actually has different crystal structures and so this diagram shows what's going on as

320
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:02,400
you as you change pressure at constant temperature here we are still down around minus

321
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,730
seventy kelvin so there we go from liquid to solid it's HCP and then it

322
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,900
becomes simple cubic and then run back and so on so this property that certain

323
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:19,090
elements have multiple different composition actually multiple different crystal structures is called polymorphism so these

324
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,130
are called different polymers you've already heard that orion has been in some instances bcc

325
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:29,250
crystal structure and fcc crystal structure in the phase diagrams will reveal when these transitions

326
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,170
here's carbon dioxide solid liquid gas is going to positive slope what's interesting about carbon

327
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:40,690
dioxide is look here the one atmosphere iso bar takes you directly from solid to

328
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:47,000
gas so it doesn't go liquid and that it gives the value as the refrigerant

329
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,610
because when it gives up its enthalpy of

330
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:57,420
of transformation you don't end up with the liquid which can mess up your content

331
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,340
and so this is often used in

332
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,360
in the shipping certain materials

333
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,590
it's got some here

334
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,960
play was drawn from this great big ice cube here but there's some sorry broken

335
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:13,090
c so this actually OK so here we are this is the big ice cube

336
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:22,250
i guess crags can one see let's creggan people which the psychologist

337
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,400
now this is minus seventy eight degrees c

338
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,630
and so it's it can go directly you're seeing it it sublime

339
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,840
so we can do some things that just to prove let's prove that it's going

340
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,270
directly from solid

341
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,190
two gas i have some interest in playing

342
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,460
spring water here

343
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,250
non carbonated this is flat

344
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:53,380
this is flat put that on the edge to of create and then just to

345
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,880
show that we're going directly

346
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,980
take this

347
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:07,900
OK k see

348
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,340
i also agree

349
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,590
so there you see the bubbles coming on a giant bubbles c

350
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,320
so we're making sio two in water

351
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:35,670
this is that

352
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,840
one should notice something

353
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,840
you know

354
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,860
you can buy this bottled water

355
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,580
if you can see craig if you can catch this PC these tiny wimpy box

356
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,340
we have a big bubbles

357
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,710
big problems

358
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,710
that c o two

359
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,340
see what else we can go and see if we still have some

360
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,730
very liquid oxygen

361
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,960
i have just a little bit he will be able to pick it up on

362
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,520
the camera OK so

363
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,520
the last thing i want to do is to go back to the

364
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,000
computer image if we could please

365
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,130
OK so we've got carbon dioxide

366
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,190
all right here's a couple of the phase diagram zirconia i mentioned to you the

367
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,520
this is just pure zirconia zero two

368
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,320
and what we find two because the former gives you that full diamond but look

369
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,860
it's stable only above about two thousand degrees c

370
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,690
so if you're going to give you sweetheart that the full diamond it's going to

371
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,840
be too hot

372
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,090
too hot

373
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,460
so we're going to learn next day is how to open up this range of

374
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,540
the way we opened up the range of liquid stability

375
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,090
by adding ethylene glycol to water and see if we can get cubic zirconia stable

376
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,670
down to room temperature

377
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,630
right but normally it's monoclinic then goes to trial goes QB was liquid and so

378
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,420
on that using goes there

379
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,380
here's carbon

380
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:05,540
mean temperature over a wide range of pressures graphite hexagonal close packed in elevated pressure

381
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,270
it becomes dying

382
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,810
here's liquid carbon

383
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,270
it turns out that by

384
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:15,690
judicious choice of chemistry people the general electric about thirty years ago reason that

385
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,590
still consists of carbon iron

386
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:23,560
and if we quenched steel we end up with carbon in the iron lattice if

387
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,440
we put too much carbon the carbon will exalt as precipitates

388
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,610
well if we could example of elevated pressure

389
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,790
could we get the carbon to exalt not as graphite but diamond cubic

390
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,000
and they did

391
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,960
generated artificial diamonds and one of the leaders of the team was course three along

392
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,840
from MIT who i met years later on committee in washington in connection with the

393
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,960
aluminum industry and he told me he was in the team that went to london

394
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,610
to negotiate with the beers they go south african diamond concern they were scared because

395
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,540
general electric reported that they could make artificial diamonds

396
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:09,770
and they general electric reported that they could make large artificial diamonds well large they

397
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,590
trying to make diamond dust they actually had one is about one millimetre was tiny

398
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,980
but the birds was was nervous

399
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,500
this is the fellow's name was right hand many told me that the thing that

400
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,750
scared him most was not sitting down with the burst because he had the blast

401
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,690
the hardest thing was getting through

402
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,230
british customs

403
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,960
because he had this on this person

404
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,420
now if he's opens up and they see all this diamond

405
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,500
the grammar and then take these counts and normalized them kind of the obvious way

406
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,540
to get a probabilistic context free grammars kind of generalization of hidden markov models

407
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,160
and if you did this

408
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:46,060
and ignoring any efficiency questions about how you parse

409
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,800
and use this to infer most likely passes you would have to pass through the

410
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,930
has what are called here baseline accuracy

411
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,310
seventy two percent it's this f one score something like how many other nodes are

412
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,170
correct i'm not going to go into the details

413
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,650
so this people have been doing this for a while it turns out this is

414
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,420
a very good number you don't really want your password to make a core made

415
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,480
mistakes record of the nodes are wrong

416
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:14,620
and as you might ask well kind of are context free grammars probabilistic context free

417
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,440
grammars somehow the wrong model class and the answers are not necessarily the wrong model

418
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,790
classes because your pass doesn't work very well and one of the reasons is that

419
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,530
the kind of the trees in the data that have symbols like noun phrase make

420
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:32,680
overly strong conditional independence assertions one kind of you probabilistic objects so for example here's

421
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,480
another sense she heard the noise and in the sense that the two green nodes

422
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,250
both noun phrases so that both noun phrases linguistically in terms of the roles they

423
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:45,650
play in the sentence at some level but somehow as a as kind of a

424
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,560
context free grammar it's not right because we can dramatically swap is we can have

425
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,920
the noise heard she would be the noise heard her side from being semantically anomalous

426
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,740
it wouldn't be syntactically correct

427
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,670
so there's something these are nounphrase are really the same and if we build grammars

428
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,170
that have such symbols are not going to be very good

429
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:02,850
and o

430
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,610
so this brings us to the task of grammar refinement what's grammar refinement all about

431
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,110
we're observing these trees but they're kind of only the courses description of what's going

432
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:17,040
on linguistically what's really going on is much finer grain their subjects their objects passive

433
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,900
position all kinds of phenomena happening and all happening at once and they are not

434
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,300
labelled histories

435
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,480
so we'd like to have some description of what's really going on and one way

436
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,870
to do this that one of the earliest ways was mark johnson parent annotation where

437
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,810
we go along saying well those entities are different because one the subject ones and

438
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,110
object we can tell that by their parents eager marking all the nodes with their

439
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,690
this is good we got more symbols so our context freedom assumptions are less wrong

440
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,040
but now we often need more data to estimate anything and so you start getting

441
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,930
sparsity problem

442
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,470
what can you do you can now take an even more extreme case and say

443
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:57,660
actually this isn't just any noun phrase in object position it's something about noise and

444
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,340
i want to say this is a noun phrase that's about noise because well it's

445
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,100
an object of the verb heard some of her goes with noise and i can

446
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,050
try to kind of get in a little bit of not only lexical syntax but

447
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,170
also some lexical semantics here as well

448
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,120
OK so this is what's called head lexicalisation or you go along annotating all of

449
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,800
you know the actual words was to make them

450
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,950
part sparsity problems you can make the passes in this way but you have to

451
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,540
work very very hard on the whole game becomes overcoming the sparsity problem

452
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:29,570
so what i'm going to talk about here is an unsupervised approach to the refinements

453
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,540
or how the trees but we're going to find them automatically and try to figure

454
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:37,510
out an automatic fashion what these true underlying syntactic processes

455
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,040
in this case we might say

456
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,200
that there is an NP one and NP two

457
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,240
but i don't know what that means and i don't know which ones are which

458
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,250
but i'm going to sort out statistically

459
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:52,300
what does this mean this means that where we used to have passes we observe

460
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:57,190
passes in our treebank are these properties that have senses noun phrase verb phrase we

461
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:01,390
observe them at test time we want to produce them but we know that underneath

462
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:05,760
everything is some more complex phenomenon and more complex phenomenon is going to be represented

463
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,780
by grammars are what are called derivation shown on the right so for example here

464
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:14,170
two derivations on the right that both derive the same pass

465
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,950
we have these passes that of be capital t we have these derivations is the

466
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,040
lower case t and what exactly are we trying to do

467
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,430
well what we're trying to do here trying to find some grammar over this derivation

468
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:31,350
that best explains in some sense and i'm being deliberately vague here the best explains

469
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,920
the observed passes

470
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:36,290
one option is one of the easiest options and we'll talk to here

471
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,330
it is to use maximum likelihood estimation with a briefly mention some other options including

472
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,760
being more vision about this and looking at doing so you could either want to

473
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,300
be more patient and more discriminative or maybe somehow both and we look at both

474
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,600
of those things but i'm going to talk today about the basic case of maximum

475
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,400
likelihood in and

476
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,210
so what we want we want these derivation parameters that maximize the likelihood of the

477
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,310
parties and you look at that and say well that's exactly what you was built

478
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,640
OK so let's

479
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,830
so let's take that a little bit further so what is in mean in this

480
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,080
case it means we're going to see structures like what's shown here on the left

481
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:14,540
where it senses noun phrases verb phrases there are going to be latent variables that

482
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,270
represent the clusters at each of these points now of course this is like point

483
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:22,990
clustering or mixture of gaussians are selling clusters are structure the interacting because the cluster

484
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,670
one point determines the probability of reaching the clusters that other points but there are

485
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,990
a bunch of latent variables and can more less on chain here to tree but

486
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,130
the the brackets are known and so on

487
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:38,000
essentially learning there really isn't much more complicated than it is for each man's and

488
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,300
we can run basic generalization of the forward backward that somewhere between forward backward inside

489
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,530
so we can you use in here to learn these subcategories

490
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,150
what might we learned

491
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,670
if we did this we be splitting stuff everywhere we have lots of kinds of

492
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,020
sentences lots of kinds of noun phrases lots of kinds of our prisoners

493
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,650
OK in particular we have lots of kinds of each of the parts of speech

494
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,800
i'm going to show you lots of them because they're very easy to get your

495
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,400
head around but don't confuse the this is only about word clustering

496
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,800
so here's the determiner category

497
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,710
and the most common determiners

498
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,170
in the treebank are the a and capital

499
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,970
case is preserved

500
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,000
right if we split that into four

501
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,100
and learn the clusters with

502
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,080
number not just learning determine clusters clusters across the whole grammar

503
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:32,580
we would find in this case the algorithm produces four categories you get one which

504
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,760
is more or less the indefinite determiners

505
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,190
the second one which is more or less definite determiners the third one is more

506
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,740
or less demonstrative and the last one more less quantifiers not perfect but this is

507
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:46,210
basically what's what's kind of being captured by the distributional clustering

508
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,710
that's great but what if we want to eight

509
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,830
in fact we're going to end up with something more like sixty four hundred twenty

510
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,700
and that it doesn't work very well you get the kind of you basically have

511
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,950
lots of search problems and you've got to model problems when you try to direct

512
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,920
but like this

513
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,640
so here's something that worked very well and

514
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,300
the speech literature and people have been doing in a lot of different places and

515
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,100
that's don't structure once hierarchically

516
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,050
so instead of just putting all my grammar everywhere

517
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,800
i'm gonna maybe say that for every single observed symbol there's two underlying symbols

518
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,760
we might get the proper determiners in the demonstrative

519
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,580
then i will take those symbols further split them

520
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,250
will get this tree of incremental refinements

521
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,060
OK again now we're back to four which is where we started but it turns

522
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,900
out you can go much farther without without hitting problems

523
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:39,260
so if we do this we're essentially going again ontology of grammars so we'll have

524
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:44,620
some basic underlying simple grammar that then get split and split and split in a

525
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:49,380
way that's kind of incrementally structurally clustered until finally gets a grammar that as refined

526
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,670
as we want

527
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:55,090
so remember we're going to have this sequence of grammars

528
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,840
and in each kind of at each step the symbols get more and more refined

529
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,950
good morning welcome to beautiful sln

530
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,080
it's my pleasure to

531
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,620
introduce here today

532
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,630
jeff dean

533
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,950
was invited to speak

534
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,810
jeff was born in hawaii

535
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,340
and during his early years

536
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,090
spent childhood

537
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,860
in many places from minnesota

538
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,410
two again

539
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,820
climbed back to africa

540
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,860
then he said to in the bay area

541
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,750
jeff is an extremely

542
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,420
the engineers

543
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,620
big dreams

544
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:43,640
and he pushes his dreams surely very high scale

545
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,610
in google

546
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,100
every time did you get a new engineering

547
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,790
jeff is the buying it

548
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:54,060
this is the very high level

549
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,710
mind of accomplishment is also

550
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,780
a very easy person

551
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,930
very easy to get along with

552
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,480
and very good

553
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,230
team building

554
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,400
there was no fatherly dept

555
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,040
i'm going to talk today about building large scale retrieval systems something i've been doing

556
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,310
for a while ago

557
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:24,260
and one of the things i like best about this area work is that

558
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:29,090
it provides a challenging blend of both unsolved research problems that you know we really

559
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:34,760
don't know how to solve interesting directions that this work can go in and also

560
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:42,030
a bunch of challenging engineering problems and if this one thing of of problems i

561
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,700
think is

562
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,700
both very interesting and challenging

563
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,860
it also spans a lot of different areas of computer science to think it's fun

564
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:52,590
to get collaborate about colleagues who have different areas of expertise

565
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,230
and it's helpful when you sort of expand horizons and learn more about area and

566
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,320
you may not know much about it when i started to google i don't know

567
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,500
much about machine learning have been able to work with experts in machine learning and

568
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,000
pick up a little bit of to bits on the side it's fun

569
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,550
and the scale of

570
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,590
the systems were building is a lot larger than most other systems that one more

571
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,660
common so that's always fun

572
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,190
another thing is that i think small teams are able to do pretty significant things

573
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:29,120
that can be used by for example hundreds of millions of people

574
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,470
and that's true

575
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,880
testament to the power after that's why i love this field because

576
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,810
new york can be used by

577
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,620
what people

578
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:46,410
OK so when you're building a retrieval system there are lots of different parameters that

579
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,830
you might need to consider

580
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:54,460
for example you might have some target of number of documents when indexing your system

581
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,780
o and maybe have some target goal of number of queries per second your system

582
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,440
needs to be able to handle

583
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,560
you want to be able to document summary maybe like to update and document the

584
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,530
second maybe like to be able to update

585
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,310
a billion documents per night

586
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,680
the sorts things you like to respond quickly to users

587
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:15,340
you need a certain amount of information to be kept about every document in your

588
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:20,430
index or other data structures that you can be using for running retrieval algorithms and

589
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,650
then you have some

590
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,430
either simple or fairly complicated retrieval algorithms are going to be trying to run the

591
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:33,020
and all of these factors and parameters contribute to sort of the difficulty in engineering

592
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,220
task interface to it if you have

593
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,020
you know small values in all the dimensions it's not that challenging if you have

594
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,090
a very large

595
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,810
values in all dimensions that increases the engineering challenge significantly

596
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,130
and it's kind of equivalent to the product of these things is it's easy to

597
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:52,780
have a very large index that you never updated it's harder to have a large

598
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,150
index that you have little time

599
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,870
and these all affect the performance of the system and what you really care about

600
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:03,930
is an engineering performance per unit hardware cost america

601
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:09,250
OK so just to give you a sense of the scaling of these parameters inside

602
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,610
google i joined in nineteen nine and give you a rough sense of how these

603
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,220
parameters to scale so

604
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,900
when i joined we had an index of perhaps

605
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:22,300
a few tens of millions of documents and today we have many

606
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,350
you know that's a hundred x

607
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,030
queries processed per day

608
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,170
the next

609
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,970
kind of rough measure but we're basically

610
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:38,380
keeping a lot more information per document that we can use to do ranking then

611
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,280
we did ten years ago

612
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,880
are update this is kind surprised me when i made the slide

613
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,760
it's actually gotten better by a factor of about ten thousand we have some pages

614
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,360
and we the index then

615
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,400
and editor chair

616
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:56,820
and is really kind of push to batch update of our whole when x once

617
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,570
every month or two

618
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:04,140
while these parameters have been changing we've been able to drop the average growing season

619
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,990
now of course even

620
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,860
a little bit by moore's law

621
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:15,270
and by a larger capital but these days

622
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,150
but you notice that

623
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:23,830
the improvement in hardware resources is not really kept up with the changes in all

624
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,640
of parameters

625
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,660
that's just to give you a sense of graph

626
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:33,360
the other thing i think is illustrated by the previous slide is the but all

627
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,710
these parameters changed constantly over time you're always getting more queries per month than you

628
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,960
did last month

629
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,650
your always wanting to annex more documents than you

630
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,230
did yesterday

631
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:51,030
an important point to make is that the right design at a given design given

632
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,400
might might be wrong to design very wrong

633
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,350
when that parameters scaled by a factor of ten or hundred

634
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,740
so a good rule of thumb i would like to use is that whenever you're

635
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,660
designing a system you want to think about what would happen if that parameter scaled

636
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:09,390
by a factor of up to ten but beyond that it's really difficult to sort

637
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,300
of have the same system work for

638
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:15,450
x a hundred access that point you probably gonna need to review

639
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,690
significant pieces of the system to

640
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,330
deal with you know hundred x more queries one hundred x more documents the tree

641
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:25,840
next get the same designs may not make make sense anymore

642
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,530
the other cool thing about web search or search in general is that

643
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,410
you can sort of replace the entire back end

644
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,840
serving system without users really noticing and we've done this many many times over the

645
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,610
last ten years or so

646
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,830
you can sort of devoted new centre

647
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:48,740
or in convert one existing data center to a completely new serving system run you

648
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,270
know some fraction of user traffic to that for a while

649
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,530
and once it seems to be stable when you convert over all the other ones

650
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,490
and users

651
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:59,490
depending on how visible the changes are that you're making on the retrieval system

652
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:03,630
you know sometimes it just seems faster users sometimes that as large index but other

653
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:09,440
the met sort of three and a half million volts maximum would become seven

654
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,650
so if i try to

655
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,760
make a drawing of that by the time here

656
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,620
prices low here

657
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,710
then you get something like this

658
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,630
so this

659
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,480
omega is no twice

660
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,250
this one

661
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:35,190
the maximum value of the EMF

662
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,530
the show that year

663
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:45,060
right to improve on my lights

664
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:49,050
you see their current meter redesigned sensitive can go to the right to go to

665
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:52,350
the left

666
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,250
and i'm going to rotate this move

667
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:00,570
when you rotate the loop in a magnetic fields

668
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,930
you can even rotate it in such a way

669
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,850
but you get no EMF

670
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:10,860
i can show that to you easily

671
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,720
this is the law

672
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,070
and if somehow the magnetic field came in like this

673
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,600
if you're OK this now

674
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,600
around this axis

675
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,780
will never be EMF because the a and b

676
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,270
always be perpendicular to each other

677
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,740
there was never any

678
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,180
flux going

679
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,460
through this

680
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,150
no flux changes

681
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:41,360
but of course if you rotate around this direction it will be fine

682
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,270
think about that

683
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:46,360
fall in that trap you can rotate in such a way

684
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,110
that there is no flux

685
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,220
we don't have that problem at all because the magnetic field

686
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,000
u on earth in boston

687
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:56,600
doesn't come straight from heaven down but it comes rather steep

688
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,140
there was never any problem you don't have to worry about that

689
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,360
so here is that

690
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,090
forty two windings

691
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:06,450
the scale varies in micro mps

692
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,690
if you want to you can calculate what the resistance of the loop is when

693
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:13,590
i rotate that's really not my objective

694
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,560
i want you

695
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:20,240
you see it when i rotated it again alternating current

696
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:21,370
very moment

697
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,950
because i wrote it very slowly

698
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,610
now i rotate fast than proportional

699
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:33,050
so if i rotate faster

700
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,720
you get a much larger maximum

701
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,080
the induced current

702
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,640
large you may have a larger current

703
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:44,430
i don't know how fast i can go to about as fast as i can

704
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:48,600
it's always up to four micro mp is maximal

705
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,120
and so we are producing here

706
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:51,860
a c

707
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:00,990
we're stepping context here so that the system doesn't break

708
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:04,680
we could put the light bulb is somewhere in this line

709
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,500
and then

710
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:09,120
the light bulb may grow

711
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,250
united states

712
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,710
what comes out of the wall

713
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:17,030
is sixty hertz

714
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,820
so that means that the current

715
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:22,130
for libel

716
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:26,610
becomes zero one hundred twenty times per second

717
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:30,680
on the fly twenty thousand per second do you go

718
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:37,310
if you have sixty hertz

719
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,710
does it mean that a hundred twenty times per second there is no light from

720
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,050
the light bulb

721
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,090
no it doesn't mean that because elements get hot

722
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,630
so they still glow

723
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:48,860
even when the current

724
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:54,030
they don't call that fast

725
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:56,300
if you take fluorescent

726
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,490
then indeed fluorescent two

727
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,850
goes completely off and on

728
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:04,320
on the twenty times per second

729
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:08,490
and therefore you can use them very nicely astrophysical of course the frequencies fixed and

730
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,650
change the frequency

731
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:10,570
it's funded

732
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:14,950
and twenty years

733
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:15,750
so now

734
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,710
you're getting the ideas of an electric generator or what we call

735
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:20,840
if you want to

736
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:23,250
but uses

737
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,990
a c

738
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,760
the turbine

739
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,100
the turbine rotates conducting will magnetic fields

740
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,160
and that according to fire they

741
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:35,250
will then

742
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,560
you left

743
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:42,190
and that runs our economy

744
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,780
however permanent magnet

745
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,380
you rotate

746
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,160
conducting loops

747
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,560
the windings

748
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,020
in the magnetic fields

749
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:56,380
the highly magnetic field the higher the EMF

750
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,360
the first rotate the higher the EMF more windings you have

751
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,310
the higher the math

752
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:04,910
and the larger the area of your

753
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,380
hi human

754
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,440
as you can see

755
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,120
on the equation that i keep

756
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:20,400
that's where it is

757
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,780
united states we have sixty words as i mentioned

758
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:30,560
and we are committed to a maximum voltage coming out that has the maximum

759
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,580
value that you get from the alternating

760
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:39,860
of holland ten times the square root of two vols and we call upon the

761
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,220
in europe

762
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,250
we have fifty hertz

763
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,620
and the maximum voltage there

764
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,260
the oscillation is two hundred and twenty

765
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:52,960
find the square root of two

766
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,860
you cannot change omega

767
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,690
go faster somewhere where you generate

768
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:02,330
this electricity because that would have major consequences number one

769
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,370
in the math that comes out of the wall go up so you might blow

770
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,320
the circuit

771
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,630
but besides that

772
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,830
you will change also the frequency of the alternating current

773
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,400
and there are many systems

774
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,560
that run in such a way that they locked into that frequency for instance many

775
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,610
electric clocks and certainly

776
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,580
record players if you still have one

777
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:26,970
i walked into the

778
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,280
sixty hertz

779
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:31,510
so if you were to increase omega

780
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,670
the record label go around fast you clocks

781
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:41,440
will go faster

782
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,750
a long time ago when i came over from europe

783
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,060
i brought my record player with

784
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:53,310
the record player requires two hundred and twenty fold so i want to transform here

785
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,760
that one hundred ten volts

786
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,350
my home would become two twenty that was fine

787
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,380
and so to record player was happy

788
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:07,030
extracted as the city five times the question is five times out of ten sentences

789
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:12,070
are five times out of one hundred million sentences that's very different probability so

790
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:16,240
this expression is actually an interplay between these two exponentials and it turns out to

791
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:17,850
provably give

792
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:22,670
the right probability now why why do we care about the fancy math here well

793
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:28,990
if we compare the performance in practice two previous approaches so so this graph showing

794
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:35,480
the urns model compared to turn is pointwise mutual information based model and compared to

795
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,880
noisy or

796
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:41,750
which is another model that was previously used in extraction work in you see this

797
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,820
is for example for relations

798
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:46,030
here and on the

799
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:52,520
y axis you've deviation from ideal loglikelihood so this is a log scale and lower

800
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,290
here is actually better idea how far we from from the right answer and you

801
00:50:56,290 --> 00:51:00,360
see that in dark black we have there is modelled very close to the right

802
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:05,610
answer in compared to the others were getting an order for fifteen hundred percent improvement

803
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:08,130
or more so this is much much much

804
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:13,670
better than the previous work and again no hand labeled data completely domain independent in

805
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:19,670
other words methods the scale to trying to tackle the the full web

806
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:25,740
now it turns out that this model works great when you have lots of information

807
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:30,550
when you have this kind of redundancy so if we want to know whether we

808
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:34,740
believe that michael bloomberg the mayor of new york that kind of thing tends to

809
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:40,150
be correct and if you play with textrunner you'll see that the statements that extracts

810
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:45,900
at the top of its results are often correct but when things get sparse all

811
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,430
familiar with this of distribution we have on the order of fifty

812
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:51,970
percent of extraction is the only occur once

813
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:55,620
and then what do you do that and you find that in those there's a

814
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,820
mixture of

815
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:02,740
stamens that are rather obscure but correct like dave shaver is the mayor of some

816
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:08,240
small town called content and also statements that are blatantly false like ronald mcdonald is

817
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,110
the mayor of macdougal where we all know it's

818
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,970
thank you appreciate that so

819
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:22,700
maybe not everybody knows that but it's actually man wrongly that is not the mere

820
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,130
them less so

821
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:31,720
there's the don't say you don't learn anything from my talk right so so how

822
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,840
do we choose these apart how do it is the

823
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:40,490
the good ones apart from the bad ones and in more recent work by doug

824
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:45,900
downey and stuffed schumacher's what they said is instead of just looking at these extraction

825
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:50,920
patterns these lexicosemantic patterns why don't we when we're considering an entity look at all

826
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,630
the context that occurs and so on

827
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:58,170
effectively for wondering is shaver mayor

828
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,930
why do we ask the question because he behave like a mayor and what does

829
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:05,720
it mean does he behaves like an area means if we take all the sentences

830
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:08,360
that shaver appears in do we see

831
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,530
statements like he was elected and you know he

832
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:16,860
i blocked the motion and he attended the city council et cetera et cetera right

833
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,320
so if we see

834
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,820
him in the presence of the right kinds of strings they're going to be more

835
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,450
and more likely to believe that he is the mayor and the same for bringing

836
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:29,740
jennifer see streets of america thing to get more and more likely believe it say

837
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,570
that this is not

838
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:36,280
an explicit computation what we do is we build the language model in fact language

839
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:41,630
model is captured by hierarchical model markov model is built once per corpus and what

840
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:46,780
the model does it really takes the entire corpus and projects it into a twenty

841
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:51,800
dimensional space to lower dimensional space and what happens then is each string is the

842
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,130
point in this lower dimensional space and what you can do is you can measure

843
00:53:55,130 --> 00:54:01,420
distances between the strings and the distances are really referring to their behavior in context

844
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:06,300
and to the statistical properties of their behavior in context again and glossing over a

845
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,550
lot of technical detail here to give you a flavour so the idea is from

846
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:13,260
trying to figure out of pinkerton is the city

847
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,470
i'm gonna map into the space and i'm going to ask what is the proximity

848
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:22,550
between thinking ten and other cities that earns theories model tells us are known cities

849
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:26,320
like seattle boston and so on so using them model like this i can tell

850
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:32,420
the pinkerton is relatively likely to be city certainly compared to other strings

851
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,420
again more of details in the paper but the point is by using language models

852
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:44,240
over the corpus we can handle the more spark his cases as well and that's

853
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,820
that's very important

854
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:52,070
OK so let me turn to the last example inference and this is the compositional

855
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:57,510
inference in this work very much work in progress so just

856
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:02,240
give you one slide on this again our ideas to get an implicit information or

857
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:07,420
looking for is very short inference chains again we're not going to prove fermat's last

858
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:12,420
theorem using the simple mechanism i'm about to show you but we would like to

859
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,320
get some basic facts that aren't in the in the corpus so let's say textrunner

860
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:20,090
notes that turing was born in london

861
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:24,240
and let's say we know from wordnet could get this from textrunner is well easier

862
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,070
to get one in london is the part of england and furthermore let's say we

863
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:34,510
have a rule that says born in is transitive thru part of what that basically

864
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:38,720
means is we can conclude that touring is born in england

865
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:42,590
OK even though the corpus might not say this in in fact in one hundred

866
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:47,630
twenty million web pages that are in the textrunner corpus it says that he was

867
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:50,900
born in london but doesn't say there was born in england right so if you

868
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,650
just a simple question answering thing as good hey

869
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:58,170
was turing born in england also know was born in london

870
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,200
that's not the behaviour that we want out of these systems so what the mechanism

871
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,780
that we build doesn't it instantiates a markov logic network on the fly

872
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,510
based on

873
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:16,820
the extraction and knows about based on rules learned from corpus what i'm about to

874
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:21,190
show you actually the rules were coded by hand the automatic learning of rules is

875
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:26,010
is actually future work but we get inference simple system

876
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:29,530
then hopefully i can show you here

877
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,610
for confinement

878
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:43,810
a lot

879
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,210
the law

880
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,850
that that

881
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,880
these are

882
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,430
people in

883
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:32,120
a lot of things that

884
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,020
you said

885
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,210
there is

886
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:19,250
using the three

887
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:34,450
of the

888
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,800
thank you

889
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:15,650
you know of

890
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,800
press release

891
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:24,600
it has

892
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:28,010
and very often

893
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:35,150
you more

894
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,060
as you

895
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:44,650
there are very

896
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,200
we you are in

897
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:57,080
i don't know anything about

898
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,590
if you like

899
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,130
process is

900
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:33,270
five or

901
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:40,110
there is no

902
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:48,290
i think

903
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:52,600
james james remind me how

904
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,200
it seems to be the

905
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:56,040
the notation

906
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:58,110
the number of goals here

907
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:00,750
is this core

908
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,910
the score of the work of the word

909
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,520
and the words in order here

910
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:13,340
the first one the first words of the so-called display the last one of

911
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:18,090
so thought guess the highest score five

912
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:22,590
this course is coincidental is just one two three four five

913
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,190
it could be this course could be ten

914
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:30,270
fifty and twenty just

915
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:32,490
do less confusion

916
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:37,340
but so you get a score five four thought

917
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:41,200
well they get score one which is the worse

918
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:42,590
it seems that

919
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,840
and then he gets

920
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:47,640
four here for

921
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:49,630
for effect

922
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:53,380
and if there is a theory

923
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:59,180
the score of four

924
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:03,310
so when you read this you have to read the scores so this is the

925
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:07,260
first one is the second one in the ranking

926
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,540
so the let's finish

927
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:14,340
before one is dreams

928
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:18,320
the rest of so your training has

929
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:27,900
it's the small

930
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,320
my that

931
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,770
they have

932
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:48,290
i felt

933
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:13,500
so this is the order the

934
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:16,510
the the order of the words as they

935
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:18,100
i have shown that

936
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:22,010
and people were asked to give up and score for each one

937
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:26,730
the high school scored closes the idea word idea

938
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,550
so people

939
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:30,380
gave it

940
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:32,480
five fold

941
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,760
i mean it's the majority of people

942
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,360
they gave one

943
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:39,010
to a

944
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,330
here's my two

945
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:47,530
four two theory

946
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,410
the dream

947
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,910
in attention to

948
01:03:57,410 --> 01:04:01,850
so these as i was trying to say

949
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:02,790
in my

950
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:08,780
and that's the way to toward these things to me would be

951
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:10,790
this one the right

952
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:16,300
that was my my choice that's if it's too hard to different

953
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,350
the ordering this implies

954
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:26,640
the better one is thought

955
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:28,540
which is one

956
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:33,530
the second one is not the second one is theory

957
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,230
which is

958
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:40,970
the third one

959
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:45,010
which is

960
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:52,700
the other one is

961
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:58,130
its attention to the right

962
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:02,790
number of ancients five

963
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:04,540
and then

964
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:06,860
play is the last one

965
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:11,000
and a number two

966
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,080
i got the right

967
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:17,030
so among there

968
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:22,550
but there are some of course this psychology model not everyone will think will agree

969
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,350
you know

970
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,640
play and attention

971
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:32,410
quite far from idea right

972
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,790
so flipping that thing doesn't mean that you are not

973
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:37,540
you know

974
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:45,460
this is just this is just one of the ironies

975
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:49,110
a low activation energy for diffusion

976
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,800
a high melting metals

977
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:55,670
has a high bond energy therefore high vacancy formation energy

978
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,760
there's such beauty in this graph

979
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:02,570
this completeness here ties everything together

980
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,820
it's really

981
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,610
so elegant

982
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:09,750
so elegant

983
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:14,640
and we can also look at diffusion by interstitial mechanism that's what shown underneath here

984
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:15,840
the same idea

985
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:21,650
the only difference is with interstitials there are so many interstitials they exist we don't

986
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:25,270
have to pay to form the interstitials the interstitials are there by virtue of the

987
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:29,000
fact that we don't have a hundred percent back the closest back structure we have

988
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:35,760
FCC and that's seventy four percent atomic so therefore it's twenty six percent three volumes

989
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:39,680
we got twenty six percent play with and it's unlikely we've got interstitial willing to

990
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:45,600
consume all that so in the case of interest shells for interstitials the q is

991
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,730
simply equal to delta h

992
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:51,680
of migration in the case of interstitial you don't have to pay

993
01:06:53,140 --> 01:07:00,910
the formation of vacancies

994
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,240
so now let's get to the question of random atomic motion

995
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:05,240
this is

996
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:08,050
well conventions that we have random atomic motion

997
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,480
let's look at are very clean experiment let's look at this when we talk about

998
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:18,270
radioactivity last suppose i make a diffusion sandwich that consists of the following

999
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:20,200
i'm gonna put cobalt

1000
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,830
cobalt it's all pure cobalt

1001
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:28,530
the only difference is the centre of the sand which is going to consist of

1002
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:30,570
radioactive cobalt

1003
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:31,910
and the

1004
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,060
the two layers of bread

1005
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,540
cool cobalt

1006
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,490
there is no concentration gradient here because you know that

1007
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:45,200
radioisotopes behave identically

1008
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:49,310
the fact that there's radioactivity does not

1009
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:53,120
affect the chemical bonding capabilities of

1010
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:57,330
cobalt because it doesn't affect the electronic structure and as far as the mass effect

1011
01:07:57,330 --> 01:08:00,550
goes it's so tiny they can be disregarded

1012
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,450
so what happens over time

1013
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:07,280
if there is no concentration gradient according to fix there should be no diffusion

1014
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:09,560
but what happens is this cartoon shows

1015
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:14,760
if we have a centre band here that consists of a mix of radio cobalt

1016
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:20,650
and regular cobalt over time we find that the cold war is uniformly distributed throughout

1017
01:08:20,650 --> 01:08:22,110
the sparse

1018
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:27,650
and if we stop action and measure the rate of dispersion of cobalt through the

1019
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:32,160
specimen we find that the rate is described by fixed laws

1020
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:34,470
so we have a random

1021
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:41,210
at the atomic level

1022
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,400
in accordance with

1023
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:46,230
six first law

1024
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,990
in accordance with fixed first law

1025
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:51,550
so this is a demonstration

1026
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,040
we have things occurring at the

1027
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:57,400
at domestic level

1028
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,410
random jumping in to make the case for

1029
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:07,620
the actual curve here always gaussians

1030
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:09,230
which is exactly the

1031
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:13,140
random walk problem you know the drunken sailor walks out the door takes one step

1032
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:17,840
forward two steps and so the chances that he gets five steps wear vanishingly small

1033
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:18,830
chance study

1034
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:23,520
falls after one or two steps are higher so you'll get gaussians curve here for

1035
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:29,540
the distance that the cobalt is gone as a function of time

1036
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:34,010
what's wrong with this cartoon by the way

1037
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:38,670
we talked about this is called jumping through cobalt were discovered after jump to

1038
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:40,070
just to jump into

1039
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:45,380
the vacancy housing vacancy here so the chances of this cobalt jumping

1040
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:50,520
and exchanging with the adjacent called now we're not talking about a tiny fluctuations

1041
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:54,620
to allow cobalt discord into a vacancy we're talking about a fluctuation like this to

1042
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:58,910
allow to cobalt to crisscross and i mean that's just not going to happen

1043
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,200
maybe once in the

1044
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:03,200
life the universe but i don't think it's going to happen so we really need

1045
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:09,830
to have vacancies in here and and ultimately we have to recognise that diffusion is

1046
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:12,430
heavily influenced by

1047
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,350
influenced by defects

1048
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:18,300
no vacancies

1049
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:20,580
four diffusion any vacancies

1050
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:23,100
better diffusion

1051
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,740
let's take a look at some

1052
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,410
evidence of this

1053
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,930
this is the plot of diffusion coefficient as a function of temperature it's an arrhenius

1054
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:33,600
plot in accordance with

1055
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,240
called in

1056
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:42,470
they are not

1057
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,670
right now we are going

1058
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,930
you know what

1059
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:25,880
this should be a

1060
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:38,470
shows you

1061
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,690
it is

1062
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,150
after all

1063
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,710
this is hard

1064
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:22,120
we're not sure

1065
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:25,660
and all that

1066
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,870
i think that's all

1067
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,700
i right issue

1068
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:03,220
i call

1069
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:18,040
they were we know that you are

1070
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:44,870
seems me i

1071
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:50,030
he said you know wrong

1072
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:51,600
got some

1073
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:48,490
my life

1074
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:55,600
why not

1075
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:05,720
i feel

1076
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,450
these are

1077
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:11,720
these people

1078
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:53,710
well we

1079
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,500
our station

1080
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:53,580
five years

1081
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:03,680
well you know

1082
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:11,540
all of the

1083
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:14,660
problem is

1084
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:30,160
the reason why

1085
01:17:33,330 --> 01:17:35,120
the station

1086
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:37,810
and then

1087
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:50,890
from you

1088
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:57,320
will be special it'll be symmetric positive definite so this'll be its eigenvectors and disobedience

1089
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,340
eigen value and the eigen values will be positive because

1090
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:03,930
this thing positive definite

1091
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:08,860
can I just now it's OK so this is my method this tells me what

1092
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,150
these are

1093
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:14,930
and how am I gonna find the use

1094
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:21,220
1 way would be to look at a A transpose

1095
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:26,560
put to multiply a by a transpose in the opposite order that will stick them

1096
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:30,080
these in the middle knocked them out and leave me with the use

1097
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:33,960
so is the overall picture there

1098
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,580
that these are the eigenvectors of A transpose

1099
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:44,000
the use the eigenvectors of a transpose which a different

1100
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:45,980
and the sigma

1101
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:49,620
the square root of the

1102
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:54,650
and the positive square roots so we have positive sake let me do that for

1103
01:18:54,650 --> 01:19:00,340
that example this is this is really what you should know and be able to

1104
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,430
do for

1105
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:05,000
that the SVD OK

1106
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:09,740
let me take that matrix so what's my 1st step

1107
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,190
compute a transpose

1108
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:14,020
because I want

1109
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:19,130
it's eigenvectors OK so I have to compute a transpose A

1110
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:23,630
so a transpose is worth

1111
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:28,540
minus 3 3 and a is for

1112
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:36,110
minus 3 3 and I do that multiplication and I get 16 I get 24

1113
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:39,460
get 16 minus 9

1114
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,110
is at 7

1115
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:46,560
and that better cannot symmetric and OK Americans out 25

1116
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:58,020
I won its eigenvectors and its eigen values its eigenvectors will be the these its

1117
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:02,170
eigen values will be the squares of the signal

1118
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:08,040
OK what are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this guy

1119
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:10,760
have you have you seen that 2 by 2

1120
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:20,170
enough to recognize that the eigenvectors are that 1 1 is an eigenvector

1121
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:25,460
so this is here is a transpose then I'm looking for its eigenvectors

1122
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:32,150
so it's eigenvectors I think are 1 1 and 1 minus because if I multiply

1123
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:36,000
that matrix by 1 1 1 0 again

1124
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:40,670
I multiply that matrix by 1 1 I get 32 32

1125
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:46,590
so which is 32 1 1 loss so there is

1126
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:48,980
the 1st eigenvector

1127
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,850
and there is the eigen value for A transpose A so I'm going to school

1128
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:56,190
taken square root is

1129
01:20:57,910 --> 01:21:00,430
in the

1130
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,480
it forcing

1131
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,500
OK what's the eigenvector the goes eigen value that goes with this 1

1132
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:11,830
if I do that multiplication what I get I get some multiple of one minus 1

1133
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:14,870
and what is that multiple

1134
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:17,060
looks like 18

1135
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:24,220
OK so those are the 2 eigenvectors Michael

1136
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:27,440
does the moment I didn't normalized

1137
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:35,020
that to make everything absolutely right ion and normalize these eigenvectors divided by the length

1138
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:40,200
square root of 2 so all these guys should be

1139
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,020
unit vectors

1140
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:50,480
and of course that normalization didn't change the 32 in the eighties

1141
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:52,760
so I'm

1142
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,610
happy with the visa here that

1143
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:57,760
so now let me

1144
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,480
put together that the

1145
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,190
pieces here here's my

1146
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:04,260
is my a

1147
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,390
let me

1148
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:08,260
let me write down again

1149
01:22:08,410 --> 01:22:11,040
this should therefore

1150
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,190
life is right

1151
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:18,850
we should get you which I don't yet know

1152
01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:20,800
you I don't get no

1153
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:22,800
signal do now no

1154
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:24,280
what sigma

1155
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:28,430
so I'm looking for you know segment of the transfer of you

1156
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:31,910
the diagonal got and the transpose

1157
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:38,400
OK just to see that come out right so what's what are the what of

1158
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:39,850
the segment

1159
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:44,370
there the square roots of these things so square root of 32

1160
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:47,540
and squared

1161
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:48,560
but the

1162
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:52,350
0 0

1163
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,220
1 of the

1164
01:22:55,240 --> 01:23:02,520
there are these 2 and I have to transpose maybe that's maybe leave with 1

1165
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:05,830
with 1 over square root of 2 in that row

1166
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:10,760
and the other 1 is 1 over square root 2 minus 1 over the square

1167
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:14,280
root of 2

1168
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:18,220
now finally have gotten know the

1169
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:22,410
well actually 1 way to do since I now know all the other pieces I

1170
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:26,190
could put those together and figure out what the user but let me do it

1171
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:27,720
the A transpose way

1172
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:32,130
OK finally used now

1173
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:36,830
but but you wanted you to

1174
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:38,000
and 1 the

1175
01:23:39,410 --> 01:23:44,370
I look at a transpose

1176
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:49,780
so a is supposed to be used in the transport

1177
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:56,280
and then I transpose that I get really is saying that transpose

1178
01:23:57,870 --> 01:24:05,130
so I'm just doing in the opposite order times A transpose and what's the good

1179
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:11,000
part here that in the middle of the transpose v is going be

1180
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:12,980
the identity

1181
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:13,630
but it is

1182
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,630
so this is just you

1183
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:25,540
sigma sigma transpose that some diagonal matrix with sigma squared and nutrients

1184
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,670
so what am I saying here

1185
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:31,930
I'm sitting here again a symmetric positive

1186
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:39,780
definite or at least definite matrix and see its eigenvectors and its eigen values

1187
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,670
so if I compute a transpose

1188
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:47,260
it's eigenvectors will be the things that go into you

1189
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,520
OK so I need to compute a transpose

1190
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:52,440
I guess I'm going to have to go

1191
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,170
but me tonight

1192
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:57,940
can I move up just a little maybe a little more

1193
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:01,800
and do a transfer

1194
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,610
so what's a 4

1195
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:13,540
minus 3 and 3 and what's a transpose for 4 minus 3 and 3

1196
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,930
and when I do that multiplication

1197
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:21,150
what I get for get 16 32

1198
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:26,800
but that 1 comes out 0 so this is the likely

1199
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,330
and how much in memory they have to use

1200
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:36,510
so here is the performance comparison between four methods - mofa, gspan, ffsm and gaston

1201
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:42,710
mofa uses a free extension gspan uses depth first right most extension

1202
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:46,180
ffsm has its own canonical labeling system

1203
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:47,790
and the gaston uses

1204
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:51,550
a specific search order. it tries to

1205
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:55,600
find is tree patterns first and then based on tree patterns

1206
01:25:55,640 --> 01:26:00,990
more complicated graph patterns can be constructed as the same time gaston remember all of

1207
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:03,970
the embeddings of subgraph isomorphism of

1208
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:05,840
previously discovered patterns

1209
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:07,500
so you can see that

1210
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:11,350
running time of time of gaston is faster than just gspan

1211
01:26:11,410 --> 01:26:14,990
and faster than FSM and the mofa.

1212
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:19,490
and the next slide we show the memory comparison between these four methods

1213
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:23,380
as you can see that because gaston and FFSM

1214
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,930
have to remember

1215
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:30,050
embeddings and there's about isomorphism of discovered the patterns

1216
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:33,350
so it cost a lot of

1217
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,340
it uses a lot of main memory

1218
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:39,850
than the gspan method and mofa method because it never do the

1219
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:45,750
sub-graph isomorphism recording so it uses less memory so you can

1220
01:26:45,790 --> 01:26:50,910
you can choose either of these amazons based on your application

1221
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:57,220
so so far i have introduced the basic design principles of the existing graph pattern mining algorithms

1222
01:26:57,310 --> 01:27:01,950
however there is a potential problem existing in frequent graph pattern mining

1223
01:27:01,970 --> 01:27:07,260
this problem is not related to the algorithm design but is caused by the definition

1224
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:09,160
of frequent graph patterns

1225
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:13,690
if the graph is the frequent, then all of its subgraphs will be frequent so you can imagine

1226
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:17,470
that if there is a large graph pattern existing in the database so it is

1227
01:27:17,470 --> 01:27:20,610
impossible to enumerate all of the subgraphs

1228
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:22,120
in this larger part

1229
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:24,160
so here example we actually

1230
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:30,520
try to mine an AIDS anti-virus screen was around four hundred chemical compounds and we

1231
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:33,010
set the minimum threshold of five percent

1232
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:37,860
it will generate are one million frequent patterns so this problem actually

1233
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:40,080
existing for all of the

1234
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:45,930
previously discovered  graph pattern mining algorithms. since they have  to enumerate so many graph patterns.

1235
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,280
so that's three problems

1236
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:53,990
caused by this phenomenon first we have interpretation problem basically giving you

1237
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:57,650
was one million pattern set what can we do

1238
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:02,010
second in many cases if we lower down the

1239
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:06,900
pattern minimum threshold we might have an exponential pattern set and the search

1240
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,010
we need some mechanism to

1241
01:28:09,010 --> 01:28:11,220
determines the minimum threshold

1242
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,040
it is very hard to actually

1243
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:16,950
so in the next several slides i will show you how can we overcome these

1244
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:18,220
three problems

1245
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:23,350
which will further advance the graph pattern mining algorithm further

1246
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:27,500
so first of all interpretation interpretation problem

1247
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:32,800
as we know too many patterns sometimes really confusing and in many cases it all

1248
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,840
the way will lead to poor results for example we can use all

1249
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:42,000
of the three principal discovered and put them into a graph classification

1250
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,790
framework and we will find that the classifier will be soon so will be

1251
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,310
so we we we we make conclusions that actually is in many cases a small

1252
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:57,280
set of representative patterns

1253
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:02,190
are good enough actually if they can preserve most of the information so we propose

1254
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:05,220
method to

1255
01:29:05,470 --> 01:29:11,800
extract those representative patterns from for example one million discovered patterns one method is

1256
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:17,090
clustering if we are able to define a distance between two graphs then we

1257
01:29:17,090 --> 01:29:23,530
can do clustering and extract the cluster centers and use these cluster centres as representative

1258
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:27,020
or which we can use top k

1259
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:28,260
pattern mining

1260
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:33,560
for example we can first to generate all those frequent patterns and is then calculators

1261
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:36,620
there significant scores and choose the top

1262
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:39,530
OK most significant patterns and

1263
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:42,950
present these patterns to the end-users

1264
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:47,780
for the clustering method basically we need to do is define a pattern distance between

1265
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:49,370
two graphs

1266
01:29:49,390 --> 01:29:52,650
so there are two methods to do this

1267
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:54,260
pattern distance measure

1268
01:29:54,270 --> 01:30:01,010
in the first method - method one we actually can use existing graph edit distance to measure the

1269
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:03,530
distance between two graph patterns

1270
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:09,400
in the second measure instead of measure the distance of this while patterns directly we

1271
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:15,650
can use the dataset that contains these patterns and user similarity between these data to

1272
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:18,460
appear to behave in some cases

1273
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:19,920
like the particle

1274
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,500
and not away

1275
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:24,710
in one of those cases this observation here

1276
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:27,180
of the photoelectric effect

1277
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:31,010
so what we're going to do is going to look at both tracks of observations

1278
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:33,880
and we're going to see

1279
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:36,930
how these observations

1280
01:30:36,970 --> 01:30:38,670
made it

1281
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:40,300
such that it was

1282
01:30:40,330 --> 01:30:42,790
impossible to explain

1283
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:47,730
how an atom held together how an electron and the nucleus held together

1284
01:30:48,650 --> 01:30:54,330
the classical way of thinking within the newtonian mechanics mechanics is going to be looking

1285
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:57,390
at this semester in eight o one

1286
01:30:57,410 --> 01:31:04,050
you can use their mechanics to understand how this electron and the nucleus they together

1287
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:09,120
you can use the mechanics to understand how to the atoms are bound together we

1288
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,140
need a new way of thinking

1289
01:31:11,150 --> 01:31:14,230
and that these two tracks of observations

1290
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:16,070
that led to

1291
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:20,570
the discovery in the sense of this new kind of mechanics we're going to be

1292
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:22,480
talking about

1293
01:31:23,870 --> 01:31:27,190
so let's start with one of these tracks

1294
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:30,350
and the attractor is the

1295
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:36,060
attractor of seeing the name is not the most basic constituent matter

1296
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:41,320
and the first observation done by this gentleman JT thomas

1297
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:44,010
the discovery of the electron

1298
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:49,180
so i'm going to need my son again

1299
01:31:52,240 --> 01:32:02,090
all right

1300
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:06,530
so what you comments was interested in doing was understanding

1301
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:09,240
what the discharges were made

1302
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:11,080
right so he had

1303
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:14,390
i last two that was evacuated

1304
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:16,400
and that she had

1305
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:19,000
what we're going to call you can hold

1306
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:24,240
here here at all

1307
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,160
they said well after all

1308
01:32:27,170 --> 01:32:28,630
from out

1309
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:33,210
and it builds up with the hydrogen h two

1310
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:38,630
and what he does is he puts a large negative potential on this

1311
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:45,600
ninety and with large positive potential any claims that the potential difference here

1312
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:47,690
he keeps creating an

1313
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:49,790
until at some point

1314
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:52,600
the gas begins to glow

1315
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:58,350
at that point it is this charge here is a nice

1316
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:01,370
and this kind of plasma

1317
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:04,500
and he wanted to understand what's in this class

1318
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,450
it's just curious he wants to know

1319
01:33:07,470 --> 01:33:08,620
and so

1320
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:09,910
what he does

1321
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:12,970
is there any pokes home here in the

1322
01:33:14,450 --> 01:33:16,270
there's a whole lot south

1323
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:18,850
a little of this discharge

1324
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:22,810
and let it out in my talk is great

1325
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:25,520
and we here

1326
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:30,700
he has some kind of a screen for screen

1327
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:32,950
so they not only

1328
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:36,390
does this discharge here

1329
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:39,680
glow is moving along

1330
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:43,950
but when it hits the first screen lights up

1331
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,310
and that's nice

1332
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:47,910
then what he does

1333
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,020
eight two

1334
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:52,410
the parallel plates

1335
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:55,040
any points at all in all

1336
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,270
this woman is being

1337
01:33:57,290 --> 01:34:01,910
and there's a pop chart one of these negative charge on the other

1338
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:03,640
and on the whole when

1339
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:08,020
increases this potential difference delta b

1340
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:09,830
what happens is

1341
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:13,890
that this woman as being some of them be

1342
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:15,770
it's actually deflected

1343
01:34:15,790 --> 01:34:17,310
a little bit

1344
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:18,250
so now

1345
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:21,450
here's another very bright

1346
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:24,310
we can measure this

1347
01:34:25,850 --> 01:34:28,950
we're going to call it tells us

1348
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:32,080
since i was going to be

1349
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:35,930
it was deflected toward positively charged plate

1350
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:37,970
kind of particles

1351
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:41,980
five world in this has been

1352
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,640
negative articles because they're attracted to the positively charged plate

1353
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:52,390
so we call this deflection delta x call delta x minus

1354
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:57,620
now he knew enough electromagnetism at the time

1355
01:34:57,660 --> 01:34:59,430
to realize

1356
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:02,810
the amount of deflection

1357
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:07,100
so which is particularly relevant to this summer school of school

1358
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:11,730
so many people want to text mining because the amount of tax information available in

1359
01:35:11,730 --> 01:35:16,090
the internet is just a huge and it is impossible for human being told that

1360
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:17,550
this information out

1361
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:26,210
actually text mining has become a very classical incubator for new machine learning algorithms and

1362
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:30,460
techniques and of models and you will see

1363
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:33,760
many of such development in this autumn school

1364
01:35:33,930 --> 01:35:39,070
so much and is playing a significant role in between text mining such as ranking

1365
01:35:39,070 --> 01:35:45,410
document in the web all understanding the topic aspect of documents

1366
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:52,110
cummings was also using machine learning to do cool things such as according what are

1367
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:56,990
thinking when you're reading something for example when you really not your bring may show

1368
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:02,360
up a special wave pattern which can be actually recognised by a machine learning was

1369
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:07,480
therefore if i your brain hopefully can decode what you actually thinking about of course

1370
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:11,710
this is something in the future which we can do now is some simplistic classification

1371
01:36:13,450 --> 01:36:17,940
and the machine is also playing an important role in bioinformatics for example if i

1372
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:20,890
show you task like these were have give you

1373
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:25,990
screams of little characters and want to ask you were in this character there is

1374
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:27,050
the gene

1375
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:29,410
actually there are much and i was

1376
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:33,260
which is exactly doing this job these days so that human being don't have to

1377
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:34,580
do experimental

1378
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,550
and for such things

1379
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,260
machine learning council

1380
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:43,150
ask not only engineering problem but also scientific problems such as i evolution

1381
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:48,770
if you see say DNA sequences or other biological traits of modern

1382
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:53,080
organisms such as human being all models which are supposedly to be derived from a

1383
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:54,230
common ancestor

1384
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:58,110
you can actually run the statistical learning was and to infer

1385
01:36:58,130 --> 01:37:02,120
what is the ancestor of the heart and said look like and highlight takes to

1386
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:06,100
grow from ancestor toward the individual you see nowadays

1387
01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:10,270
so these are some quick examples of one machine learning can do for you

1388
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:15,560
and that comes to a more technical definition of machine learning which i personally come

1389
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:19,660
up with a just want share with you because the street your definition is kind

1390
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:20,460
of vague

1391
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,180
and it is very hard to

1392
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:25,830
for those who probably guess what is exactly were doing for example in these

1393
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:27,530
autumn school

1394
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:30,230
so i summarise machine learning this single slice

1395
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:31,600
which says that

1396
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:34,680
machine learning six to develop those series

1397
01:37:34,690 --> 01:37:36,650
and the computational systems

1398
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:40,720
doing certain tasks as it is the following

1399
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:41,800
it is for

1400
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:46,690
o classifier clustering or recognising objects

1401
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:49,120
for reasoning and uncertainty

1402
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,760
offer predicting unknown in the future

1403
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:57,680
all four reacting to certain environmental stimuli

1404
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:01,040
which is existing in the complex real world data

1405
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:03,110
and also it is based

1406
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:05,870
sorry you start to read it is based

1407
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:10,550
the systems own experience with data rather than i tell the system what to do

1408
01:38:10,570 --> 01:38:15,350
and also hopefully under a unified model of mathematical formula

1409
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:19,760
such that the system we developed or the theory that it was it was developed

1410
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:22,870
can be formally categorized and analyzed

1411
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,800
and also we can take into account the common prior knowledge due to some of

1412
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,700
form or principle and

1413
01:38:28,790 --> 01:38:32,760
the fundamental mathematical techniques

1414
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:37,150
and also can generalize and that across and domain so that you can learn from

1415
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:40,760
this part of the data to do task in the other part of data which

1416
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,320
is called transfer learning

1417
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:47,650
and and also can operate automatically and autonomously without human intervention of our minimum amount

1418
01:38:47,650 --> 01:38:48,870
of mentioned

1419
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:54,230
and also can be interpreted and perceived by humans so when learning about box which

1420
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:56,850
can do things want to actually understand why

1421
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:58,300
it was performing well

1422
01:38:58,310 --> 01:39:03,310
and what true actually can be covered all learned are inspired from the performance of

1423
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:05,260
such words so this is my

1424
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:10,780
slice of summarising what machine learning is about of course it's not just your personal

1425
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:12,960
so there's a great deal challenges

1426
01:39:12,970 --> 01:39:15,370
in machine learning research

1427
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:20,240
in order to develop computer systems that can automatically improve with experience

1428
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:21,080
and also

1429
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:25,960
and also to uncover what is the law governing the learning process in general

1430
01:39:25,970 --> 01:39:28,200
and it turns out that tool

1431
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:30,230
so such changes

1432
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:36,010
we need to integrate expertise all knowledge is from a lot of different domains and

1433
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:38,330
typically these three domains forms

1434
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:42,870
the pinnacle of machine learning which is that it's computer science and the human

1435
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:44,740
and animal learning study

1436
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:49,590
so in statistics we want to use statistical models and theories

1437
01:39:49,610 --> 01:39:51,620
to infer data

1438
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:54,070
and also to characterize

1439
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,820
the reliability all

1440
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:59,540
performance of such early i would

1441
01:39:59,590 --> 01:40:03,070
and in computer science we want of course developed cold true

1442
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,920
so this problem automatically

1443
01:40:04,930 --> 01:40:09,950
and i also want to study the complexity issue involved in such learning problems

1444
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:12,100
and of course they want rules

1445
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:13,970
i understand why why learning well

1446
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:19,720
so how we can better using a computer therefore ontocat motivation all inside from

1447
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:25,620
no studies in animal psychology and in the human learning so that we can you

1448
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:31,680
know can kind of get a ground all research into a more general

1449
01:40:31,730 --> 01:40:35,490
human perceivable basis

1450
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:43,430
it is exactly because of all these motivations and these need no we actually renamed

1451
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:49,000
our centre of automated learning and discovery into discover this torrent of machine learning

1452
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:54,820
which is sort of to be you know time to serve as a protein four

1453
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,620
people from multiple disciplines to interact

1454
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:03,130
in very intimate sense and also to do research on today and also to develop

1455
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:09,980
curriculum and to teach classes and supervise students and they're very unified goal

1456
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:13,600
but with a very diverse set of approaches

1457
01:41:13,710 --> 01:41:17,130
and maybe even philosophy

1458
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:22,110
we now have a very strong group of core faculties

1459
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:23,640
horse names are

1460
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:25,010
listed here

1461
01:41:25,010 --> 01:41:34,940
and then

1462
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:47,040
this presentation is delivered by the stanford center for professional development

1463
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:51,360
let's get started with today's material

1464
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:57,000
so on welcome back to second lecture

1465
01:41:57,010 --> 01:42:02,990
what i want to do today is talking about on the regression gradient descent and

1466
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:09,920
the normal equations on and i chose to lecture notes had been posted online and

1467
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,950
so you know if some of them have a go over today of my goal

1468
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:16,930
rather quickly if you want to see every equation written out and work for the

1469
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:23,140
details also yourself because of the course home page and download some detail lecture notes

1470
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:29,530
that pretty much describes all the mathematical technical content over today on

1471
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:34,310
today i'm also going to delve into fairmont some amount of linear algebra and so

1472
01:42:34,310 --> 01:42:39,450
on if you would like to see a refresher on linear algebra of this week's

1473
01:42:39,450 --> 01:42:44,050
discussion section will be probability is and will be a refresher on linear algebra so

1474
01:42:44,050 --> 01:42:48,210
this is of some of the outer right talk about today

1475
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:51,790
seems to be going by quickly or if you just want to see some of

1476
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:55,930
the things i'm claiming today without proof if you want to just see some of

1477
01:42:55,930 --> 01:43:00,970
those things result in detail on come to this week's discussion section

1478
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:11,460
actually establishing a fun video on remember at the last lecture the initial lecture i

1479
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:13,260
talked about supervised learning

1480
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:19,050
as supervised learning was this machine learning problem where i said we're gonna hold the

1481
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:25,160
album what the call right answer is for you ever ever for a number of

1482
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:29,220
examples and we want the album to replicate more to say so the example i

1483
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:34,300
had on the first lecture was the problem of predicting housing prices where you have

1484
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:38,800
a training set and we tell the algorithm what the code to write housing price

1485
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:43,990
was for every holes in the training set anyway algorithm to learn the relationship between

1486
01:43:43,990 --> 01:43:48,840
you know sizes of houses and the price essentially produce more of the quotes right

1487
01:43:50,010 --> 01:43:54,110
so they pay for you video now i wish the big screen

1488
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:55,680
so think video now

1489
01:43:56,500 --> 01:44:00,940
there was from dean palmer who want somewhere he did carnegie mellon

1490
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:05,920
on apply supervised learning together called the drive itself

1491
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:10,940
this is work on vehicle known as alvin was done about this this was done

1492
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:12,970
for about fifteen years ago

1493
01:44:13,410 --> 01:44:16,950
and it was all

1494
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:20,950
he was very elegant example of

1495
01:44:20,970 --> 01:44:24,360
the sorts of things you can get supervised learning algorithms to do

1496
01:44:24,370 --> 01:44:30,010
on the video you hear dean palmer use voice mentioned an album called neural networks

1497
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:32,560
was a little bit about that later but some

1498
01:44:32,570 --> 01:44:36,850
the the social learning algorithm for this is something called gradient descent which which actually

1499
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:39,900
sort of data in today's lecture let's with

1500
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:47,370
the video

1501
01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:50,220
alvin is the system of artificial neural networks

1502
01:44:50,230 --> 01:44:55,010
learns to steer by watching the person drive

1503
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:58,160
however is designed to control the nevland two

1504
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:01,630
modified army humvee equipped with sensors

1505
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:03,890
and actuators

1506
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:08,150
four autonomous navigation experiments

1507
01:45:08,190 --> 01:45:09,610
the initial step

1508
01:45:09,660 --> 01:45:14,080
in configuring album this training and we're just here

1509
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:17,130
during training a person drives the vehicle

1510
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:23,450
while alvin watches

1511
01:45:23,470 --> 01:45:25,530
once every two seconds

1512
01:45:25,570 --> 01:45:29,160
alvin digitize is the video image of the road ahead

1513
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:39,440
and records the person steering direction

1514
01:45:39,450 --> 01:45:45,180
this training image is reduced in resolution to thirty by thirty two pixels and provided

1515
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:48,530
as input two albums three layer network

1516
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:53,810
so two comments very one is on this supervised learning because learning from the human

1517
01:45:53,810 --> 01:45:57,890
driver in which a human driver shows that you know we're on this segment of

1518
01:45:57,890 --> 01:46:02,800
the road was steered zango the second row is the this angle as the human

1519
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:07,680
provides the number of calls correct steering directions to the car and then is the

1520
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:12,620
job of the car to try to learn to produce more pieces code correct steering

1521
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:14,860
directions that keeps the car on the road

1522
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:16,840
glucose metabolism

1523
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:22,900
it has it has as its there are generated from metabolism it has the end

1524
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:26,590
products of nitrogen metabolism which is chiefly urea

1525
01:46:26,610 --> 01:46:27,570
and ammonia

1526
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:31,160
and those and and that blood is indicated here is the blue

1527
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:37,930
now we usually show these blue blue-collar vessels usually show as red and blue indicating

1528
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:42,500
locks of oxygen red not very much oxygen blue but it's not just oxygen is

1529
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:48,010
changed right the chemical composition has changed dramatically there's a lot more common outside there's

1530
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:48,940
a lot more

1531
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:54,020
there's a lot more of other things coming out of the of the in it

1532
01:46:54,020 --> 01:46:55,030
through the veins

1533
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:57,480
the small veins called the

1534
01:46:57,490 --> 01:47:03,270
merge to form larger veins eventually very large brains like being a cave which come

1535
01:47:03,270 --> 01:47:07,920
back to the right side of the heart

1536
01:47:07,970 --> 01:47:11,110
the right side of the heart is anatomically very similar to the the left side

1537
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:15,290
there's a tree and there's the ventricle

1538
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:17,600
and blood flows out of the ventricle

1539
01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:20,470
through the pulmonary artery

1540
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:22,410
to the lungs

1541
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:24,690
now notice that there is something different here

1542
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:29,070
but on this side of the circulatory system the part where the blood is going

1543
01:47:29,070 --> 01:47:31,860
up to the rest of your body the artery

1544
01:47:31,910 --> 01:47:35,360
contains oxygenated blood

1545
01:47:35,370 --> 01:47:37,590
on this side play you

1546
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,670
the pulmonary artery

1547
01:47:41,690 --> 01:47:42,800
is an artery

1548
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:45,190
it has the same features as

1549
01:47:45,270 --> 01:47:50,540
a systemic artery like the order has the muscular wall for example doesn't transport nutrients

1550
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:55,320
so it looks like an artery but it carries d oxygenated blood

1551
01:47:55,330 --> 01:47:57,800
it's carrying it only one place

1552
01:47:57,810 --> 01:48:00,060
back to the lungs

1553
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:01,740
and is collected in the

1554
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:05,210
collected on the other side of the long now with oxygen and returns to the

1555
01:48:05,210 --> 01:48:07,530
point where we start

1556
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:14,670
it's not just that it's not just a closed system is to closed systems

1557
01:48:14,690 --> 01:48:18,980
it's too close systems one that we're going to call the system

1558
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:21,870
but that by the left side of the heart

1559
01:48:21,890 --> 01:48:26,330
we're oxygenated blood goes out to the whole periphery of your body

1560
01:48:26,410 --> 01:48:30,990
and is and is collected back by the right side of your heart that's one

1561
01:48:30,990 --> 01:48:32,470
closed system

1562
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,290
the second is

1563
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:35,040
it is

1564
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:37,010
the pulmonary

1565
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:39,170
vascular system which is

1566
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:40,270
which is

1567
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:43,130
which is

1568
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:47,270
the forces generated by the right side of the heart

1569
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:50,470
the flow is generated by the right side of the heart blows only to the

1570
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:54,560
to the lungs and oxygenated blood comes back to the left side so it's sort

1571
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:56,410
of like a figure eight right

1572
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:57,800
one loop

1573
01:48:57,820 --> 01:49:00,060
a second loop

1574
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:01,800
what's the

1575
01:49:01,810 --> 01:49:06,780
if the rate of flow is five litres per minute through the order

1576
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:09,180
what's the flow rate in the pulmonary artery

1577
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:12,610
the two independent systems

1578
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:19,650
so what's the rate of flow in the pulmonary artery

1579
01:49:19,670 --> 01:49:23,720
it has to be five litres per minute because they are not independent right the

1580
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:28,280
there there there really i described them as two closest is really one closed system

1581
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:30,620
with the with the loop right

1582
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:34,550
with the loop so the flow has to be the same everywhere

1583
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:39,860
the flow has to be the same everywhere

1584
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:44,100
OK so let's talk about blood flow in these vessels for a moment i have

1585
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:50,070
this picture of the overall of the overall composition of the circulatory system let's think

1586
01:49:50,070 --> 01:49:52,510
about a very simple

1587
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:54,220
a very simple

1588
01:49:54,230 --> 01:49:58,780
problem that engineers have thought about for hundreds of years now it turns out to

1589
01:49:58,780 --> 01:50:03,300
have a lot of relevance in the cardiovascular system but has relevance

1590
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:06,020
everywhere has relevance in terms of

1591
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:08,170
getting water to all the

1592
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:10,530
forces in this building

1593
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:13,910
this you have to solve the same problem and that is

1594
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,240
generating enough pressure to allow

1595
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:19,840
fluid to move through the length of

1596
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:21,240
two being

1597
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:25,620
and so will think about a typical length of tubing i'll make it as simple

1598
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:32,200
as possible it's vessel has a constant diameter radius and online

1599
01:50:32,210 --> 01:50:36,300
and and fluid is going to flow in one into this vessel is going to

1600
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:37,840
flow out the other

1601
01:50:37,850 --> 01:50:40,680
this is called internal flow through it two

1602
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:44,750
and it turns out to be one of the most well studied problems in all

1603
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:49,080
of engineering i'm just going to tell you one aspect of this that over a

1604
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,590
certain range of flow rates

1605
01:50:51,610 --> 01:50:55,300
over a certain range of flow rates so this is true all the time but

1606
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:57,430
this was

1607
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:36,710
the first

1608
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:58,780
this is

1609
01:53:06,770 --> 01:53:10,570
these are all

1610
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:16,310
so the whole

1611
01:53:16,330 --> 01:53:18,550
we are just

1612
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:38,660
this is

1613
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:45,370
it i

1614
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:32,170
so all

1615
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:58,080
well it

1616
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:18,790
there you

1617
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:38,170
the whole

1618
01:56:50,730 --> 01:56:53,760
the first one

1619
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:07,740
o point

1620
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:36,090
the first one

1621
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:45,630
that is the

1622
01:57:58,650 --> 01:58:06,870
what will

1623
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:15,780
so called

1624
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:35,070
he has

1625
01:58:35,090 --> 01:58:40,830
the point

1626
01:58:43,330 --> 01:58:49,140
four years

1627
01:58:52,790 --> 01:59:02,450
and the

1628
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:30,650
in this work

1629
01:59:38,330 --> 01:59:46,280
that is

1630
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:51,260
it's like this this this and this

1631
01:59:51,450 --> 01:59:53,370
this model

1632
01:59:55,870 --> 01:59:58,720
of my brothers and

1633
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:01,800
like this

1634
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:06,100
yes it's true that there are there in principle question there if you had let's

1635
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:09,720
say you had no fifty data points or something like that then the difference in

1636
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:12,430
marginal likelihood you might might my

1637
02:00:12,450 --> 02:00:15,470
often be in overwhelming so that you know

1638
02:00:15,490 --> 02:00:19,800
you know the one parameter is not gonna is not going to really

1639
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:24,070
change things the right could well be that fitting in data set inside this model

1640
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:26,360
it uses a very large value alpha

1641
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:27,680
o point

1642
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:31,220
which is a simpler model

1643
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:33,870
and but it can choose a simple model over over

1644
02:00:33,910 --> 02:00:38,570
over more complex one even if you're even if it's allowed to to cheat a

1645
02:00:38,570 --> 02:00:41,820
little bit on one parameter right

1646
02:00:44,590 --> 02:00:46,320
well BIC

1647
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:49,640
it's it's often a terrible

1648
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:54,320
approximation so but whether terrible is worse than ignoring the problem

1649
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:55,240
you know

1650
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:59,840
i don't know so typically typically anything you do a little bit better using a

1651
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,390
lot more work

1652
02:01:01,430 --> 02:01:05,340
right so there's there's trade off their i

1653
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:10,600
nineteen ninety four

1654
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:21,570
well i think it matters quite a lot of what covariance function using it so

1655
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:23,340
let me show you an example of

1656
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:28,140
a real data set right and so we'll see things that you wouldn't be able

1657
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:31,570
to do if you just said you know let's just use

1658
02:01:31,620 --> 02:01:32,640
you know

1659
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:35,360
let's just have

1660
02:01:35,410 --> 02:01:41,280
so let's come to an example and look at that

1661
02:01:41,320 --> 02:01:46,240
OK so so so up until now we've also been looking at very smooth functions

1662
02:01:46,470 --> 02:01:52,090
you can also be also families that generate distributions are functions that don't necessarily have

1663
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:55,260
all derivatives so you can choose functions that have say two

1664
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:57,890
so the partial derivatives but not

1665
02:01:57,950 --> 02:01:59,890
primitives of higher order than that

1666
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:04,740
and the covariance function for that look something like this where k here is a

1667
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:06,220
modified bessel function

1668
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:11,510
not sure what that is but i can certainly plug so here you sample functions

1669
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:14,640
of the covariance functions look like this again you get the gaussians

1670
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:18,470
a special case and you can get rough and for functions of functions that have

1671
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:21,780
less and less derivatives and again you can see here the green you have sort

1672
02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:25,570
of a smooth function and right

1673
02:02:25,680 --> 02:02:29,450
in black you have something which is a little more interesting behaviour and you can

1674
02:02:29,450 --> 02:02:33,640
get you know quite quite scary behavior out of this kind of thing is well

1675
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:38,550
quite so we are not just restricted to to working with with smooth functions

1676
02:02:38,550 --> 02:02:43,180
is not a little trick which domenici i to me a long time ago so

1677
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:48,950
you can get periodic functions by instead of looking at covariances between points themselves you

1678
02:02:48,990 --> 02:02:51,570
map the point assigning call signs

1679
02:02:51,590 --> 02:02:58,800
of the of the points in the new measure the distances in that space so

1680
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:03,740
because the distance measure is now periodic the function should get are also chaotic and

1681
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:08,570
here another example for simon that if you you can write down you know quite

1682
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:11,990
your comments pages like this and then you could pick random functions and you see

1683
02:03:11,990 --> 02:03:19,160
they're all exactly periodic right this is quite amazing like so these are periodic functions

1684
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:21,140
but they are not sines cosines right

1685
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:26,370
just random functions which are which are periodic and inside the period here used the

1686
02:03:26,370 --> 02:03:30,590
squared exponential covariance function of the this smooth periodic

1687
02:03:30,780 --> 02:03:35,220
and here had chosen long lengthscale lengthscale which is almost the same as the period

1688
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:38,180
so we get something which is close to sinusoidal

1689
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:41,740
here chosen the lengthscale internal links which is much shorter

1690
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:46,800
then the period so i get a lot of behaviour inside the period right before

1691
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:50,840
all right so

1692
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:57,260
it's a very unusual name

1693
02:04:00,450 --> 02:04:05,070
know the covariance function actually strictly positive

1694
02:04:05,090 --> 02:04:07,640
i'm putting random functions drawn from

1695
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:11,570
well no it's not having shown the covariance function

1696
02:04:11,590 --> 02:04:18,530
i'm showing you random functions drawn from the process without going over the next

1697
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:21,100
yes so

1698
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:22,930
i think all the ones i've shown you

1699
02:04:22,950 --> 02:04:24,930
no they the the one

1700
02:04:24,990 --> 02:04:27,010
as negative covariance right

1701
02:04:27,030 --> 02:04:28,010
so there's no

1702
02:04:28,010 --> 02:04:32,620
you don't have to have a strictly positive covariance functions and this is something that

1703
02:04:32,620 --> 02:04:35,760
worried me a lot in the beginning that when you're looking at when your modelling

1704
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:39,640
functions in your covariance function says that you only have positive

1705
02:04:39,680 --> 02:04:44,490
covariance and it turns out that as it turns out that doesn't really matter very

1706
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:45,700
much unfortunately

1707
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:47,140
it's hard to give

1708
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:51,770
it's a good intuitive explanation about so if people are interested in that i should

1709
02:04:51,770 --> 02:04:56,990
maybe offline because always make it might bit it might sound complicated but there some

1710
02:04:56,990 --> 02:05:00,450
good reasons why it doesn't matter so much it has to do with the fact

1711
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:06,280
that it is very easy to infer the low frequency components of the function

1712
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:09,360
all right so

1713
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:12,950
now let's put this all this stuff together right so i showed you this example

1714
02:05:12,950 --> 02:05:15,180
before we started although it was a little bit of a sort of a toy

1715
02:05:15,180 --> 02:05:20,300
example at least at some some real metadata so how do i use accounting process

1716
02:05:20,530 --> 02:05:23,120
to make predictions on this dataset

1717
02:05:24,010 --> 02:05:26,510
the way i'm going to do it is that i'm going to i'm going to

1718
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:29,890
i'm going to cheat a little bit because i'm a sort of pragmatic basis right

1719
02:05:29,890 --> 02:05:32,120
so i look at the data

1720
02:05:32,140 --> 02:05:39,360
i don't know exactly what the i don't know much about about sort of sort

1721
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:42,950
of chemistry of the atmosphere chemistry but i can look at i can certainly look

1722
02:05:42,950 --> 02:05:46,260
at the data right and look at the data and i say well

1723
02:05:46,260 --> 02:05:47,180
there are certain

1724
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:50,390
trends that i can but i can but i can pick out here and how

1725
02:05:50,390 --> 02:05:53,880
could i have a model that could model trained so the first ran the simplest

1726
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:57,810
one is that there is a long term seem to be equal right over fifty

1727
02:05:57,810 --> 02:06:00,410
years you know is that the the

1728
02:06:00,410 --> 02:06:02,090
concentration went up so

1729
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:05,860
and we know we can we can get no smooth trains with with a squared

1730
02:06:05,860 --> 02:06:08,620
exponential covariance function right so put that in there

1731
02:06:08,620 --> 02:06:12,320
i'm saying that i don't know what the magnitude is so that's free parameter

1732
02:06:12,340 --> 02:06:16,280
and i i don't know exactly what length scale this trained happened but that's not

1733
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:17,530
a free parameter

1734
02:06:17,550 --> 02:06:20,870
OK but there was more stuff in their right

1735
02:06:20,890 --> 02:06:26,510
there's also those seasonal component you can see that these are monthly data right you

1736
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:30,300
can see there a very strong seasonal component there's also some very good reasons why

1737
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:34,820
you have that seasonal component so maybe you should try and model that as well

1738
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:38,390
so one way of modelling that is using this construction that we just saw where

1739
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:44,180
you can get periodic functions so here's a covariance for for for periodic functions so

1740
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:46,970
i say i don't know what the magnitudes of my period

1741
02:06:47,010 --> 02:06:49,180
i said here to one year because

1742
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:53,120
because of because of my prior domain knowledge
