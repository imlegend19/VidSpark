1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,510
so maybe we can we can have this as a public discussion because maybe other

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,870
other people also confused i confuse them so maybe you can

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,970
ask the question

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,040
that's right

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,270
that's why

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:33,160
yes i would very in in very much detail talk about this in later lectures

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,170
but the

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:43,330
some people imagine playing piano with the left hand and right hand some people if

9
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,830
they imagined foot than they imagined to kick evolve

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,530
there are some are imagined to clench his or to squeeze the balls

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,580
i mean there are different strategies

12
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,130
like i imagine two

13
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,030
some sensation in my hand for example

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,820
so the sensation of heat or sensation of touch or

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,580
things like that

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,710
OK so

17
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,810
this is just to give a broad overview of of of things that are done

18
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,780
everywhere in the world and

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:29,420
slow cortical potentials have proven to be very stable and

20
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,570
successful technique to deal with

21
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:39,440
four patients not only for healthy subjects because of individuals that you on the beginning

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:45,200
play in the guys playing ping-pong they're very happy healthy subjects and it's it's much

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,200
easier for them of course to do this

24
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,400
so as i

25
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,940
i remarked at some point

26
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,270
there's some

27
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,970
so there's some individual calibration phase

28
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,270
and you would like to

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,750
make it known or make inferences about

30
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,540
so the subject in ten

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,320
and this might be different from other people

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,080
we come to that

33
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,810
the whole question

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,740
a few years

35
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,910
that's a very good question this will be in

36
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,090
maybe one of the top school

37
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,620
instigated here

38
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,160
if you're a city

39
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,710
but yes

40
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,690
it depends very much you would you upload

41
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,990
anything with the time not

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,320
depends on your the state of your brain

43
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,710
and you stated your brain product

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,100
of all these things

45
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,380
cost BCI

46
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,570
there some so-called more rhythms

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,800
i articles the related desynchronisation

48
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,730
little synchronisation

49
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,420
and this

50
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,000
big literature about them they they were

51
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,310
found by

52
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,060
four to learn the process

53
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,240
a while ago

54
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,060
people have ties

55
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:46,110
that there's so they come from the from interaction of talamanca cortical connections

56
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,180
activity responsible for that so

57
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,290
in a sense

58
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,930
what you see is so so if you very tired say

59
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,810
so you offer them goes up

60
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,230
oakes is on the occipital side here somewhere here

61
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,810
and so this means

62
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,490
you signals have this structure that i showed on the slide so this

63
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,710
this is like spindles

64
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,980
and if you

65
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,750
now intend to move or a few

66
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,560
imagine two more or fewer

67
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,420
two something cognitive then this aphorism is suppressed

68
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,380
this is called event related desynchronisation so so to say the idea the brain

69
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,240
suppresses your idling rhythm

70
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,620
to do something

71
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,840
this was a very sloppy explanation but but i think it gives you a good

72
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,100
intuition of what is happening

73
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,380
and so if you imagine your left hand c

74
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,100
on you

75
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,640
contralateral hemisphere

76
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,440
i on the right hemisphere there's some activity

77
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,900
imagine your right hand

78
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,760
and on the left hemisphere there would be some activity

79
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,730
and this is

80
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,320
basically that's going to target the joint distribution by two

81
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,400
because so if you want that to the algorithm makes well you cannot obtain sample

82
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,050
which are basically as entity to be distributed according to pi two that ends their

83
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,950
model their component in x is going to be according to prior to this with

84
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:35,070
the reason OK so what the case where that this this thing might work OK

85
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:39,760
so if you look at what's basically try to give some four

86
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,190
target distribution

87
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,400
by two

88
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,800
you learn that the conditional obviously distribution of u

89
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,470
next and applied to the world simply is important is the uniform distribution

90
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,110
of these including tells you will get max the importance of the issue to someone

91
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,130
by removing the compute the normalized version of the target you on the numbers between

92
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,670
zero and pi gamma x that the value of x OK

93
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,610
OK so let's say that was basically

94
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,130
i was having next

95
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,400
then this is basically

96
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:28,690
so i drawn into a small number of all on this into old zero DMX

97
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,210
on ten new values you here OK

98
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,730
this is what i think

99
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,840
now what i want to do

100
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,440
if i one basically

101
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,210
not to update the company x

102
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:46,990
given you end by to talk about something that under this artificial target distribution where

103
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,690
one is this this time distribution

104
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,510
well so be essentially is going to be essentially proportional to one

105
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,150
if gamma x is supposed to do

106
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,460
o zero otherwise so what does it mean that actually

107
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,860
so essentially

108
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,260
what he tells you

109
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,530
so you have you feel OK

110
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,960
so basically you're gonna slice

111
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,820
the target distribution at this slower

112
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,510
on you're going to solve for x uniformly

113
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,300
basically in region where gamma x

114
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,400
he said to you that is

115
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,070
this to entailed OK

116
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,230
so what you like to do

117
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,320
once you have basically

118
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,400
the sample you

119
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,630
you basically slides the the target distribution

120
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:42,780
OK this lower on you want to some poor basically x uniformly

121
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,650
on this interval that's what you want to do

122
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:50,240
OK so this is slice sampling so you could send me sampling from this target

123
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,110
this new like slice

124
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,880
this is the solution may not be obvious because you need to know something about

125
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,320
the geometry of the target distribution

126
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,440
OK this is true but actually is the lot recipe that have been put forward

127
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,820
to sample from that automatically in the paper by what from the that appear in

128
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,570
and out of statistics if two years ago so i'm not going for it

129
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,190
but if you want more detail you look at the paper by what from the

130
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,070
that appear in and out of stats

131
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,940
in two thousand three i think OK

132
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,380
it turns out that by just having this kind of scene paul

133
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,380
o que se i

134
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,340
violating this policy i five or can help you can't help you come l basically

135
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,300
coming up with much nicer in santiago reason which i know a lot of case

136
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,630
rejection for OK so i refer you to the paper our from the for that

137
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,970
another thing that has been proposed in the literature

138
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,110
proposed by physicist because you see that the ideas coming from or a physics consideration

139
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:59,570
is what is called a meeting of the multicellular OK so suppose that for example

140
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,680
you want to some of the target distribution pi x where x is basically a

141
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,860
real valued

142
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,610
a simple in this case

143
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,440
OK so

144
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,630
i mean to multicolored that

145
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:21,420
well does something that looks actually quite silly to start with is basically is going

146
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,300
introduce new target distribution

147
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,280
pi two k which is the point at which is proportional to the initial target

148
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,670
distribution of interest

149
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,570
time basically

150
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:40,090
you have basically someone the liability eye on the valuables v on the simpsons space

151
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:48,010
OK which are assumed distributed according to a normal distribution of means zero all

152
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:53,260
on the identity clients it seems like we do something with nothing here OK so

153
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,130
we had essentially

154
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,710
this is the original target distribution we multiply it by the motion

155
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,130
OK independent ocean

156
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,610
so it seems like a pretty useless from a politician point

157
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,470
OK well it's not because this is a very clever to spend a lot of

158
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,820
time working with the count so

159
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,960
to say so we're just gonna basically

160
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,920
defined mediterranean is essentially minus the log of pi to that

161
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,170
OK so let's consider

162
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,880
this what is called a meeting at which the function of x and v

163
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,510
so this is minus log of by two thousand is minus log gamma which is

164
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,570
called the energy

165
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:38,030
in physics applies basically you have to take minus the logo based on the notion

166
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,900
that divide gauche and you have this them coming

167
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,610
OK so

168
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,320
no basically

169
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,360
if you look at the physics literature

170
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:55,190
there some scholarly opinion dynamics which are essentially determining dynamics defined by its importance or

171
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,590
which as such that essentially starting from a point x v

172
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,010
you know the whole

173
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,530
suite of analytic tasks like

174
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,780
machine learning itself has several well-known stay just one example formation

175
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,740
evaluation and deployment

176
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,280
and if you look at these

177
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:23,610
some concrete numbers value from worked at yahoo on user activity modeling

178
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,410
the number of pages

179
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,210
per user

180
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,200
might be ten two hundred

181
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,120
ah but the total number of values here as

182
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,450
in the millions or tens of millions for the cytosol

183
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,500
the number of

184
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,450
quine's of things that people do

185
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,740
can be an order of magnitude larger hundreds of millions

186
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,230
the number of atoms that displayed the people actually click as much possible

187
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,770
right hundreds or thousands

188
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,040
and with this

189
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,640
you want to get a sense of which uses respond which acts

190
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,290
can that's in a nutshell what are trying to do

191
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,230
if you try to do this

192
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,210
u create features

193
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,020
and try to predict events as follows

194
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,250
there is a window

195
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,660
if you look at the things that people dead searches

196
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,660
or browsing activity

197
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,900
in the window

198
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,450
and you see whether this is predictive of some event of interest that they click on a particular action

199
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:22,860
in a target window

200
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,440
then you sliding windows

201
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,400
i did a peak

202
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,340
this is how long standing cases okay

203
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,350
hand if you look at the numbers involved in all this

204
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,870
you're talking about a few others for data acquisition

205
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,560
four to six hours

206
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,490
four the

207
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,690
demanding that gives you features

208
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,270
the actual model training is a relatively small fraction still

209
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,780
it's significant wanted to others right and does not for a single model so many

210
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,470
many models which yields caught in flight

211
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,640
let's look at this in a little more detail

212
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,550
you might think he made

213
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,230
and so on this rule extraction who have the idea of email

214
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,720
and the words that characterizes it from a click on you might get label

215
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,590
is this something that's is this action that the user did

216
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,940
that is the label good about

217
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,020
spam or not

218
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,680
the construct cases you might be doing essentially a very large scale joint

219
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,100
fortunately these are data parallel functions

220
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,210
in one year

221
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,760
by essentially reporting are pipeline we use

222
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:46,530
how do

223
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,150
incidences plan spam detection became the reported plan

224
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,000
went down but there forty percent

225
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,280
basically because

226
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,860
the time taken to build the filters went down dramatically

227
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,360
and the sooner you insert filters four new kinds of spam

228
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,890
and classify them as financial people never see them in their inbox

229
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,700
the less than one reports back

230
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,650
scale matters

231
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,450
learning the language classifiers other example

232
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,030
use feature extraction from a variety of internet sources

233
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,950
then you learn from them

234
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,440
but if you look at what's going on in each of these scenarios

235
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,800
on the one hand things like mapreduce

236
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,710
on the other hand in your modelling phase you want on iterative algorithms are various kinds

237
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,450
which today are not well supported and mappings

238
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,790
so what do you do

239
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,380
the performance and among for example

240
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,900
leaves much to be desired

241
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,730
if you want to do the kinds of deep learning that you read about at scale

242
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,880
trust me there are using multiple

243
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,370
how do bring those kinds of platforms

244
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,640
to be generally available

245
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,710
this what we're talking about

246
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,040
so if you want a scale model building

247
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:17,400
learning is fundamentally attractive you apply the model data you observe the errors you better model and to keep

248
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,800
doing this until you have a good enough model

249
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,800
am four

250
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,490
here are the weaknesses in mapreduce in current model systems

251
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,530
that kill u

252
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,150
mapreduce can deal with one iteration

253
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,360
and in between iterations

254
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,510
you need to

255
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,090
rescheduled get fresh tasks

256
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,280
tasks talk

257
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,900
this expensive

258
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,840
unit to persist your data

259
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,090
reading and writing data the ios an issue

260
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,360
the serialization deserialization costs

261
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,880
are equally an issue

262
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,150
all this

263
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,650
know a dozen papers that talk about how to have some way or the other

264
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,550
to do machine learning on the

265
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,760
they all have a universal speed up from thirty

266
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,030
at the conclusion is

267
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,650
you need to award these round-trip overheads

268
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,360
and no matter how you do it

269
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,050
it's a pretty robust factor a factor of thirty

270
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,860
the tool that you're trying to say

271
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,510
in terms of performance

272
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,650
let's go back to object

273
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:34,530
they don't just want to build a better machine learning system although that's something i will talk about it

274
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,150
we also want to build a better other kinds of analytics systems

275
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,760
if you consider building

276
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,740
the next generation a sequel as indeed many people are currently doing

277
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,940
you worry about four dollars

278
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,770
all the time should get used to that

279
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,630
here's another one let's play this game one more time we can ask how much

280
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,250
is the volume of the body came when he

281
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,750
the ten the volume

282
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,350
again would be proportional deciding what you

283
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,210
times the increase in temperature

284
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,580
put another number

285
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,400
this called the coefficient of volume expansion

286
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,500
and that depends on the material

287
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,130
if you take copper

288
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,350
copper will have a certain alpha

289
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,750
i reliable different alpha will will have different out you will have different out

290
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,400
this is the property of the material

291
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,310
if you say well i had something

292
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,850
and when heated up by one degree increased by nine inches

293
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,960
another one increase by two inches

294
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,980
is it clear that the first one expands more readily

295
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,790
it's not because the first one could have been in my long second one could

296
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,980
be in a foot long

297
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,330
so you have to

298
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,960
pick out certain factors that universal and the rest of it you put into a

299
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,810
property of the material

300
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,210
similarly when it comes to specific heat

301
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,210
you ask how much he does it take to

302
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,790
some object it depends on the mass

303
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,630
it doesn't matter what your heating

304
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,480
but an increase in temperature because the whole purpose of adding it's always going to

305
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,810
be linear in the

306
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,920
delta t

307
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,440
this one is the property of the material and by definition sequel to one

308
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,130
television gram

309
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,190
on one here locality

310
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,600
what what

311
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:17,060
once you've got

312
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,650
so remember one

313
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,350
calorie program for walker is the definition

314
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,480
once you've defined water

315
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,020
to have a specific one calorie per gram

316
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,960
you can define specific it but other materials

317
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,230
by the following

318
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,460
so what do you do you take

319
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,670
a container with some water in it

320
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,710
let's assume the container zero mass i don't have to worry about approximation

321
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,230
if you're worried about that you take a huge containers so that the volume of

322
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,270
water dominates the surface area of the campaign

323
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,770
anyway containers neglected you've got some water

324
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,400
this water is of some initial temperature t one

325
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,100
and i have some new material led

326
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,810
i want to find its specific heat

327
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,040
i take the lead in the form of pellets

328
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,900
and he the the lead pellets

329
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,580
some temperature t two

330
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,440
and a drop these guys

331
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,150
and that's what

332
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,170
be an example where initially the lead

333
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,440
is an equilibrium may be on the furnace the temperature t two

334
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,270
what is an equilibrium may be in the room temperature t one

335
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,400
then i put the pellets into the water

336
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,040
the period when the temperature is not defined

337
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,710
and so on they own settled down

338
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:39,020
for some common template quality

339
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,810
we will now postulates

340
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,020
this is a possibly

341
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,670
or a lot

342
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,380
the total change in q

343
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,770
is zero

344
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,730
in other words if q

345
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,250
it's lost their one body and gained another body the loss in the game was

346
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,650
it's the new law

347
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,270
you can make up all the new last you want you don't have the right

348
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,900
to the line first make

349
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,020
it in that case what can you say in this particular problem

350
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,850
in any of the problems they are due to draw the following picture is one

351
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,150
it's not the temperature is the final one

352
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,480
which we don't know

353
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,060
what we can measure what thermometer and measure

354
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,080
then you say

355
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,080
the mass of the water

356
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,710
specific the water which is one

357
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,170
and delta t

358
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,380
with the the final temperature minus initial temperature

359
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,330
ditto for the lead pellets

360
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,400
so the lead

361
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,230
this kind of symbol pb

362
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,350
time specific heat which i don't know

363
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,500
times change in temperature is the final

364
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,560
minus the two

365
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,420
this is equal to zero

366
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,960
the sum of all the incident that is zero

367
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,420
this is the game

368
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,620
of heat

369
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,250
of the water

370
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,130
this if you work kind will be a negative numbers

371
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,650
because you can see the final is below initial t this will turn out be

372
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,500
negative and positive and negative latter zero

373
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,360
so what is it you don't know

374
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,900
well you know the mass of the what specific in what one by definition

375
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,880
the final and you want to measure the thermometers

376
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,790
as of this for you to measure

377
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,790
these are non you can find c

378
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,920
so this is a birthday present for you guys this is an example

379
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,150
jump on this first because you've been doing this and i still i know kids

380
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,920
love this kind of calorimeter problem

381
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,520
that's correct so

382
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,710
the point is that everything expanded linearly one have the disagreement difference between different among

383
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,920
so it turns out

384
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,310
two an excellent approximation

385
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,440
the change the length is proportional to the length

386
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,020
but it's not exactly proportional to like that would be terms involving higher power so

387
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,190
not only that

388
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,540
set of nodes

389
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,620
o p is interpreted as this industry and its let's p if you prefer p

390
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,260
to score a because this is what i

391
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:32,210
what they should do this time so it means that it's own set of nodes

392
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,150
that are labeled by a

393
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,890
the given tree it is fixed set right

394
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,820
so in the stream

395
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,690
the mapping

396
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,400
is the constant function

397
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,630
it takes any set of nodes and that maps it

398
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,900
on to the set of nodes that are labeled by a

399
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,880
so the least

400
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,750
six point

401
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,500
how how do you make it seem to have

402
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:00,690
something which maps on two on two PN which is the fixed point it's pizza

403
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,390
and there's no other

404
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,430
OK alternative so

405
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,990
this is what is written here

406
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,890
OK this is five

407
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,040
you don't even need to look at your model

408
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,110
two guess

409
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,430
what such formula

410
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,950
corresponds to sally take something more difficult to understand

411
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,120
so let me right

412
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,460
i mean shortcuts here so this means either the left or the right

413
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,010
satisfies beta

414
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,650
so that means that a child

415
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,200
which satisfies beta

416
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,140
and here

417
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,250
war child

418
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,480
all children are satisfied

419
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,080
and now are in the formula

420
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,880
so this news later

421
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,430
but there are in this formula

422
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,480
and what does that mean

423
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,940
so now i have

424
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,250
which says OK

425
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,500
one of the only six point of

426
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,370
the mapping which takes a set of nodes and

427
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,770
so here i trying to describe

428
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,820
this thing here is that we seem to be already yesterday

429
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,750
so what what is this mapping

430
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:33,270
OK let's use the semantic so if i take a set of nodes

431
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,260
after map it right

432
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,860
basically what the definition is in my

433
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,210
on my slice so in

434
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,230
it is tree

435
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,110
well actually the variable z

436
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,170
is interpreted as

437
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,980
this actual set of

438
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,860
so what is this

439
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,460
what this is

440
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,890
the semantics of p a

441
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,300
z does not sure

442
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,770
this formula i actually this one has no viable so this doesn't really matter

443
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,260
i mean this interpretation is clear it's the set of nodes which are labeled by

444
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,480
a that's it

445
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:28,700
union one disjunction is interpreted as union because negation and and conjunction well respected deputy

446
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,800
this compromise union intersection

447
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,370
and you

448
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,220
OK i have to interpret this formula

449
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,190
and this

450
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,510
so what is this

451
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,490
this is if you know

452
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,040
get the bit

453
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,300
how we writing this is the set of nodes

454
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,040
a child with the is left to right

455
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,720
because this is

456
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,460
left or right child which hits z

457
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,080
but what is and what is the semantics of that

458
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,660
the semantics of that

459
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,600
is the set and

460
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,810
so this is simply

461
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,330
the set of nodes w such that

462
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,850
belongs to

463
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,520
the right and left some of the body belongs to an or

464
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,140
the rights on w belongs to and in other words

465
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,240
is the set of nodes so that in one step

466
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,340
you hit

467
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,550
the set and OK that's it

468
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,540
thank you

469
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,930
and this is as we said well just

470
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,820
all the nodes that are labelled by a so either

471
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,980
so what am i mean in the in the

472
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:52,400
the image of a set of nodes and either

473
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,810
and labeled by a man and

474
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,520
i mean f of probably of n

475
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,690
i labelled by and by a or

476
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,150
in one step a heat and

477
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,110
skin is

478
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,940
the label is

479
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,810
one in the is the label on label that you can find on the on

480
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,670
the tree

481
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,670
a is an element of this

482
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,730
alphabet used to decorate

483
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,540
you treat OK that's the proposition

484
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,830
now i want to the least fixpoint

485
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,020
so computed

486
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,610
so my another mapping the mapping is this one

487
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,190
it's very easy

488
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,080
very clear

489
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,820
so on the least fixpoint how do you compute the this fixed point wanted to

490
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,060
get the this fixed point of this one you start with the

491
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,850
this element of the the latest here

492
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,180
the bottom

493
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,370
but i is and

494
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,690
it's the mt

495
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:04,970
and now we going trade so i'm supposed to compute OK try to this one

496
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:09,240
and the more risk from the context so i want to compute

497
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,310
as of the empty set what is evident is that look

498
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,820
i it's simply

499
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,650
the nodes that are labeled by a

500
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,060
union union what

501
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,690
so that the chinese the right child belongs to the and set number

502
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,550
and as you know china

503
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,810
but you assume

504
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,870
a tree which is the full tree

505
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,200
then we can have a set of things

506
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,230
if you meet if you take a month trees but

507
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:47,260
here let's mister in this way so here

508
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,070
so that means that

509
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,910
the ratio of lambda squared off for a squared is a constant

510
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,770
well when i went to school what they taught me in math was that if

511
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,190
the left hand side of the equation is constant the right hand side of the

512
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,920
equation is constant so that means even though theta

513
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:10,350
is varying with hkl this ratio varies in such a way as to remain constant

514
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,680
that's the key

515
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:17,280
so whatever hkl is at that theta the rate the signs were that angle over

516
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,720
the age group was k squared plus elsewhere remains constant as you go through all

517
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,160
of the lines so this is the underlying principle

518
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,600
so let's go

519
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,710
let's go into the so the first thing i want to do is i want

520
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,670
to build science where theta

521
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,140
so there are they are those that theta values and i've taken divided by two

522
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,070
and squared taking the science where is and i got a new column and then

523
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:47,760
analysis is normalized by dividing science where theta by the first member of the color

524
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:53,350
so all i did was i took everything and divided by point one four three

525
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,970
so this point one four three divided by point one four three is one

526
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,660
this is you can see one ninety divided by one forty one thirty four and

527
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,670
so on

528
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,890
OK why because look i'm going to this

529
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,800
going to this

530
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,800
what's next thing clear the fractions from the normalized column i don't like this like

531
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,530
one one point three four and so on one point three four to me alive

532
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,730
for some experimental error

533
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,900
isabelle roughly one third is is roughly four thirds and that's two point six seven

534
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,870
that's roughly a third so someone multiply the whole darn column by three

535
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,400
and throw away the little residuals and sure enough you get a set of whole

536
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,490
numbers three four eight eleven twelve and so on

537
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,710
this is good

538
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,250
we're getting somewhere

539
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:43,000
so now it says speculate this is where you get to participate speculate on the

540
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,970
hkl values

541
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,880
that if expressed as h grabowski squared plus elsewhere would generate the sequence of the

542
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,540
clear fractions column and remember what you have to go on

543
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,690
you've got that set of

544
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,210
simple cubic

545
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:01,460
face centered cubic body centered cubic so what set of hkl would give you this

546
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:07,400
well what's what sum of integers squares would give you three

547
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,670
i one

548
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,930
maybe one one one how about four

549
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,900
so you can see what's going on here this this i've gotten from the feet

550
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,290
and this is my speculation

551
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,100
just right

552
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,750
here's the punchline compute for each theta the value of this

553
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,860
the signs were defeated over eight squared plus is

554
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,760
k squared plus elsewhere

555
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:36,990
and if you get constant bingo you must hit the jackpot so let's do it

556
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,140
science feet is this a squared plus k squared plus elsewhere to square to three

557
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,610
that's all four seven seven you do it for the next one in x one

558
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,650
x one allowing for experimental

559
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:53,220
error i got constant so what does that say it says that my speculation of

560
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,290
what the hkl are

561
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,760
is good self consistent

562
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,970
and what do i know

563
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,250
those are all even or

564
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,180
they're either all even or odd that's the sequence for face centered cubic

565
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:10,290
that's the sequence for face centered cubic so on this basis i can say

566
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,280
that i've got

567
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,620
something that's face centred cubic

568
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,700
so i'm happy about that but further more

569
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,370
what else can i get

570
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,920
well i know the lambda value and i know this thing this is that this

571
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,940
is that constant there

572
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,320
so what i can do is i can take this constant and plug it into

573
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,140
this equation and furthermore i can determine that the a whatever this crystal is going

574
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,270
to be lambda

575
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,220
of copper KL four

576
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,980
divided by

577
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,210
two times square would that constant

578
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:48,630
and if i plug in the numbers i get three point five three

579
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,790
three point five three angstroms so it's FCC it's three point five three angstroms if

580
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:58,690
i look at it and it looks metallic i want to say it's nickel

581
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,890
because i happen to know the decal has a lattice constant three point five three

582
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:06,080
extra i know what i gotta do some other things but certainly that makes me

583
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,910
thinking think about whether i've got nickel present

584
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,060
here's the

585
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:16,120
i think this is that was just very modest

586
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,730
so for that we need to get the notion of cliques

587
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,130
so clique is a subset of the graph

588
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,860
which is fully connected

589
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,410
and the maximal clique such as well

590
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,750
at small ones in the graph and they obviously also define the graph

591
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,810
drawn three cliques here

592
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,520
on the graph

593
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,190
can you tell me some more clicks

594
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:45,400
that two more clicks on the maximal cliques of the graph that happened really strong

595
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,160
otherwise without randomly pick somebody

596
00:33:54,690 --> 00:34:03,140
this one here

597
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,690
very good

598
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,420
it's one maximal clique

599
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,100
there's another one missing

600
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:13,950
somebody else

601
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,960
there's more

602
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,360
is very good

603
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:26,430
so what we can do is we can write the entire graph to

604
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,190
is the set of maximal cliques

605
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,080
this one

606
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,870
one and this one

607
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,360
this is actually fairly

608
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,830
well behaved graph in

609
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,720
terms of graphical models inferences will see afterwards

610
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:43,200
so we wouldn't have to do anything like pluralisation transposition and all that so is

611
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,530
actually a really nice

612
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:50,740
so this will allow me to specify dependencies between variables

613
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:55,840
then a is just some graphical models inference algorithms for inference

614
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,020
so what

615
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,800
i think we'll started on you know is that these exponential families

616
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,840
the models that was talking about actually fairly closely connected

617
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:12,740
you can just roll those models instantiate the various terms as will see

618
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,690
the right side of sufficient statistics

619
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,440
and everything will work out quite nicely

620
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,250
well might be quite that obvious to you it is how this is all connected

621
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,790
to say something to talk or to chance talk

622
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,490
the idea that will be that

623
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,690
in many cases

624
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,490
you can look at conditional models

625
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,190
so for instance let's say

626
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,080
i have

627
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,180
a binomial distribution

628
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,550
i have

629
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,500
additional once is here

630
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,720
it's a it's apples and oranges

631
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,440
and that's a condition this

632
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,060
on the picture

633
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,640
what get classifier

634
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,930
so now modelling the probability of

635
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,340
apple orange

636
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,700
conditioned on

637
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,980
well the picture of an apple or norwich

638
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,870
so immediately i get

639
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,710
the classifier

640
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,200
so let's say

641
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:11,500
i have a normal distribution

642
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,810
that conditional on some locations

643
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,610
well the input data get the regression estimator

644
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,490
then on estimating the mean possible the variance

645
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,870
that gives you

646
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,700
the actual give heteroskedastic regression estimator

647
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,430
which is something really nice

648
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,250
but it's very very simple

649
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,370
OK now

650
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,470
let's put this is

651
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,770
so perhaps the cafeteria

652
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,430
o thing about another fifteen minutes or

653
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,180
most of you think

654
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,140
from another fifteen

655
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,480
OK good

656
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,260
so this MC is

657
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,340
if i have

658
00:36:53,350 --> 00:37:00,390
some undirected graphical model with these conditional independence properties then the joint distribution pfx

659
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,460
decomposes into some

660
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,840
on the maximal cliques

661
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,290
so this is why

662
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,280
for instance in the way the example

663
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:14,110
i was able to actually model the joint distribution of us all carrying umbrellas around

664
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,740
in such a simple way

665
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,900
they only had to

666
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,700
model the connection between

667
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,860
the cloud

668
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:25,100
and my carrying the umbrella or somebody else can

669
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,670
these functions here

670
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,350
can depend considerably fewer variables

671
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,350
the joint distribution

672
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,850
we still have to

673
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,940
the problem here names normalisation today need to take care of

674
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,480
but other than that

675
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,430
this is all really nice

676
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,900
OK is small catch

677
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:48,290
pfx needs to be nonzero on the entire domain

678
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,510
so if you have some serious main you just need to exclude it from the

679
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,910
domain in the first place

680
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,760
and everything works fine again

681
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,940
but it's completely mixed with each other something can never becomes zero

682
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:05,970
it can be up true closer but never

683
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,540
if we can use this house to posterior for the exponential families

684
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,090
so far you would think well

685
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,460
in talking about

686
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,230
graphical models

687
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:26,060
exponential family models how they relate well actually in this case

688
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,520
these two are really master connect

689
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,350
the what get is that

690
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:38,830
sufficient statistics for fixed will just decompose into sufficient statistics on the maximal cliques

691
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:44,660
it doesn't sound terribly exciting sector in approach between those terms

692
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,530
they get something that will decompose into inner products between

693
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,350
functions defined on the maximal cliques only

694
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,470
if you michelle phillips stop this was the crown

695
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,970
so what happens is

696
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,890
the kernel

697
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,200
on the big set of random variables

698
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,900
decompose into cross

699
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,760
on the maximal cliques

700
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,620
if the conditional independence properties

701
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,950
so can begin fasting complicated

702
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,980
dependency structure

703
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,860
just look at the maximal cliques

704
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,330
you know what the problem is to decompose like

705
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:29,240
this is also something that you can actually actually then useful feature selection include determination

706
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,200
sadly proved

707
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,250
but just matching terms

708
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,910
and here we're doing the same thing

709
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:42,460
OK the martyr later often converts as a signal sequence

710
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,450
two of baseband waveforms and then converts the baseband waveforms to pass band waveform

711
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,700
and just historically

712
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,280
people used to think of modulation

713
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,740
as the process

714
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:01,640
if taking something at baseband and converting it to some past bad

715
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,240
now it is recognised that the interesting problems

716
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:09,590
it's not how do you go from baseband the past and which is just multiplying

717
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,120
by cosine wave is not much more to it than that

718
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,840
and there was a little more to it but not much

719
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,640
and the interesting problems

720
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,990
is how do you convert

721
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,270
the way forms

722
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,740
which is why we went one of the reasons we went through all of this

723
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:37,700
about l two waveforms an orthonormal expansions and all of this stuff

724
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,480
OK so

725
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,680
the timing we're going to look in modulation and demodulation without worrying about

726
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:54,650
what bandwidth any of this occurs at so we'll just look at it at baseband

727
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,580
OK so the simplest example of all of this so simple that it almost looks

728
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,390
like it's silly

729
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,210
is to map the sequence of binary digits

730
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,480
in a sequence signals from the constellation one minus one

731
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,450
OK so what you're doing there

732
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,460
is turning

733
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,140
this mapping zero into one

734
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:21,020
a mapping one into minus one another with the zero and one binary digits are

735
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,640
mapped into one minus one why do you do with this way which is a

736
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,810
little confusing mapping zero into one

737
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,980
instead of mapping one to one

738
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,940
well primarily so you can look at multiplication

739
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,390
of signals

740
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,110
in the same way as you look at modulo two addition

741
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,740
the binary digits

742
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:43,980
it just turns out to be a little more convenient that way

743
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:47,760
and it doesn't make a whole lot of different the point is we're going from

744
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,640
zero ones to signals which are one minus one

745
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,230
OK then this sequence of signals

746
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,980
is mapped into a waveforms

747
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,020
which is the sum of u k

748
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,580
times the same function t over capital today

749
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:09,180
minus kept in other words you're thinking of each one of these signals now

750
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,020
think of it as being some

751
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,500
of impulse is delayed impulses

752
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,020
and then think of taking a little sink

753
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,390
seventy over t

754
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:24,000
captain putting it around each one of those impulses another would think of passing each

755
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,160
of those impulses which is weighted by one of these values use k

756
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,200
into a linear filter

757
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,000
his response

758
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,600
it is a sign of

759
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,370
x over x

760
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,850
anybody see anything little bit fishy about that

761
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:50,020
if you are able to filter whose response was signed x over x

762
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,230
one hour

763
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,060
it's hard to y

764
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,230
because it's not causal yes

765
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,000
OK we talk about that more later today

766
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,210
communication engineers

767
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:06,700
hardly ever talk about causality

768
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,710
hardly ever talk about whether something is realizable or not

769
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,520
and the reason i want to say this the number of times

770
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:20,680
is that one of the parts of any receiver is the timing recovery circuit

771
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,390
and what the timing recovery circuit does

772
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,060
is it tries to figure out what the transmitter timing is in terms of what

773
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,850
is receiving

774
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:33,440
and when you figure out what the transmitter timing is in terms of what you're

775
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:40,120
the most convenient way of doing that if you're sending a pulse or something

776
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,430
he would like to receiver timing

777
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:47,310
to pick up at the same time that the transmitter timing is picking up in

778
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:51,060
terms of both in other words you want to get rid of the propagation of

779
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,500
the lie and just ignore them

780
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:58,480
the receiver timing is going to be to be delayed from the transmitter timing

781
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,270
exactly by the propagation to lie

782
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:04,640
now if we always do that

783
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:10,080
causality becomes totally unimportant

784
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:15,430
one of the problems with the same function as it starts time minus infinity

785
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,230
and even if you like the receiver timing by an infinite amount of time you

786
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,790
can never use the communication system

787
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:28,020
until it's time to tear it down and and bring in in new ways

788
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:33,330
which unfortunately is what happened to the third generation wireless system by time people figured

789
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:37,500
out how to build them everybody was saying that

790
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,210
old-fashioned stuff

791
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,960
we're going to go directly on the fourth generation

792
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:46,540
and they might go directly from fourth-generation fifth-generation who knows

793
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,850
well anyway

794
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:55,660
you can implement these even with the receiver timing different than the transmitter timing

795
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:02,350
but you can always approximate things with enough delay between transmitter and receiver so that

796
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:08,940
you can approximate any filter you want to do without worrying about causality at all

797
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,560
and it's hard enough designing good filters without worrying about causality

798
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:16,830
you don't want to bring that into your picture

799
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,730
at the beginning

800
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:25,640
so communication engineers usually say that those timing issues are not important

801
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:30,020
and a little bit of the light is not going to hurt anything

802
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,540
all shannon's theory

803
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,390
it was as successful as it has been

804
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:38,870
and transform the whole communication industry

805
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:42,390
because he never talked about the lay all

806
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:46,250
he just ignored the question of delight from beginning to end

807
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:50,370
and when you look at his capacity formulas

808
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:54,250
they are assuming that you have as much the layers you need

809
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,390
between transmitter and receiver

810
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:01,730
and assuming that that is an important and in terms of the propagation delays in

811
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:07,850
and the and the filtering delays in most modern communication systems those delays are not

812
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:11,070
if there is a soul as well as the body

813
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:16,800
and there's always something immaterial then when the body dies when we have been ones

814
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,700
to be an and the death of the body occurs so at the end of

815
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,340
the any of the body stops repairing itself decay sets in you know we all

816
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:29,420
know the sad story is the one crawl into the worms prolog the end of

817
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,160
the day

818
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:35,000
well may take longer than a day the body has decomposed

819
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,800
yes all that

820
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:40,360
this speaks to the end of the body

821
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,460
but if the soul is something immaterial

822
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:51,250
then that could continue to exist even after the destruction of the body

823
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,100
that that's the that's attraction

824
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,400
i was one of the attractions of dualistic view the belief in the soul did

825
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,460
you something to continue to exist

826
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:07,210
after the end of the about so what death

827
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:13,650
it normally there's this super-tight connection

828
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,810
between my soul and my body

829
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,670
death might be

830
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,450
the severing of that connection

831
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:23,650
and so

832
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,750
the body

833
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:28,900
breaks and no longer able to give input up to the soul

834
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:35,090
so longer is no longer able to control the body and make it move around

835
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:39,790
but for all that the soul might continue to exist

836
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,150
so at least the possibility

837
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:48,850
that i'll survive my death is one were taken very very seriously if we are

838
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,560
a couple of

839
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:57,870
things to point out about this view

840
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:01,750
one is i've been talking as go

841
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,850
a person

842
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:05,080
is that combination

843
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,470
kind of are us

844
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:13,010
old anybody sandwich

845
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,220
so a person has true

846
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,760
the basic building blocks

847
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,930
the bodily part and the sole part it's natural to talk that way

848
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,140
but if we want a belief in the soul to help us

849
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,020
hold out the possibility of we weeks that there might be life after death then

850
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,560
i think we need to actually say that strictly speaking

851
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:38,950
it's not that the person is a soul

852
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,770
plus body

853
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,060
strictly speaking i think we need to say

854
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,660
the person just is

855
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,070
the soul

856
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,480
after all

857
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:54,600
if the person is that combination if the person is the pair stole plus the

858
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,980
body destroying the body you destroying the pair

859
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:03,310
if the person who is the pair and the pair no longer exists

860
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:06,210
the personal longer exists

861
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:10,590
so if we want to belief in the soul to help us we open the

862
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:16,100
door to the possibility that i survived the destruction of my body

863
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:19,510
it better not be that the body is an essential

864
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,080
part of me

865
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:24,500
it's simpler more straightforward

866
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,910
to say instead

867
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:31,910
what i am strictly speaking is a soul

868
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:37,720
as long as the sole exists i exist

869
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,760
course my soul meeting

870
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:46,630
i have a very tight connection to a particular body

871
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,770
but still you could in principle destroy the body with the without destroying the look

872
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,540
i particularly close connection to the house i live in

873
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,920
but for all that you can destroy

874
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:01,550
my house without destroying me

875
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:05,110
so that i think the position that we ought to strive to

876
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,410
to do list

877
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,520
the person is strictly speaking the soul

878
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,390
so has a very intimate connection with the body but the person is not the

879
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,390
soul and the body the person is just the soul

880
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:19,950
so even if the intimate connection gets destroyed

881
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:23,370
the person the sole could continue to exist

882
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,380
second point to clear clear up is that

883
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,160
three different issues

884
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:31,720
that might interest us

885
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,320
one metaphysically

886
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,470
our bodies and souls distinct

887
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:41,040
is there is the mind to be understood

888
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:45,640
in terms of this immaterial object the all

889
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:49,950
so i there are two kinds of things that the first question our souls and

890
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,260
bodies distinct

891
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,240
the second question though is

892
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,550
does the soul

893
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,980
even if it exists does the soul

894
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:01,630
survived the destruction

895
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:05,040
there are body

896
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:10,800
it could be something separate without surviving that's what i'm trying to say

897
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:15,400
if there are cells at least that opens the door to the possibility

898
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,220
that we will survive hard

899
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:25,780
but doesn't guarantee it because as it further argumentation there's no guarantee that the soul

900
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,070
survives the death

901
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:33,070
of the body even if it's separate it could be that it gets killed at

902
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:37,610
the very same time were destroyed at the very same time the body is being

903
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:39,540
destroyed maybe when

904
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:46,370
these physical processes b one through bn take place

905
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:52,380
they set into motion remember after our interaction is listeners is very tight causal connection

906
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:56,290
between the body and the mind about the soul and the body the body and

907
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:58,060
the soul

908
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:03,810
just like when you prick my body that bodily process sets up certain things taking

909
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,700
place in my soul

910
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:10,120
maybe one b one through bn take place

911
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,340
they set up some other

912
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:15,230
processes in my soul

913
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,730
call them

914
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,090
as one

915
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,660
through s

916
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:27,320
and maybe s one through s and results in the destruction of my soul

917
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,830
so simon will taneously with my body

918
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,290
o my soul

919
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:39,020
because here to draw

920
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:44,650
so the first part as one that that that that that that's easy as an

921
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,710
the question how do i draw the so i don't really know

922
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:02,770
the mere fact that we decided we do ultimately decide that there is a whole

923
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:06,470
something non visible separate and distinct from the body

924
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:10,750
is to go over all the edges and multiply the probabilities of the edges and

925
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:15,490
go over all the zeros in the graph and multiply the correspond one minus

926
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:20,510
the co responding values right so so for this for zeros I would take this for a

927
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:31,550
one minus these four guys and multiply them here and for all the ones I'm multiplying them here right makes sense right yeah sorry question when you get all possible

928
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:38,890
combinations good question good question I'm coming to that yeah

929
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:49,650
if you do the sides of your we need to cut them so that you will have the exact right size of your final waves

930
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:56,550
that's also a very good question I'll come to it so basically this is a this is a

931
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:01,370
model selection problem right you are asking you know should I fit the linear function or a quadratic function so

932
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:04,850
that's that's sort of separate let's assume that somebody tells us it's two by two

933
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:10,550
and let's also assume that the sizes match what you can do if the sizes don't match

934
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:14,910
you can just pad here with zeros okay and this is what we do in

935
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:19,350
practice but if it's a good question but if you put it aside let's for

936
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,910
now assume somebody says us that this is two by two and that the size of the

937
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:28,270
graphs match then the likelihood is very naturally defined right since I'm doing this

938
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:34,750
independent coin flips I just ask what's the probability that I observed exactly this coin flips

939
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:41,210
and as mentioned there will be two problems one is this node correspondence problem we don't know how

940
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:47,090
how these nodes map to these nodes right so we would need to try the all of them out

941
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,990
in the second one it's scalability right even if I know

942
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:57,070
how these node match so maybe I should I should this way right so let me first talk a

943
00:54:57,070 --> 00:55:03,190
bit more about node correspondence right so even if I know the adjacency matrix so even even how

944
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:10,850
how I number these guys I will get different adjacency matrices so my likelihoods will be different right and

945
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,630
the reason for this is that when I have a graph I just have

946
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:18,400
the structure I have no node labels I have this this numbering of the nodes is

947
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,190
arbitrary right I can number an one two three four or I can number them some other

948
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:25,610
way and the way I number them I will get different adjacency matrices so

949
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:29,330
if I calculate  the likelihood as I showed before the likelihood of this graph

950
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:33,030
is different than the likelihood of of this graph even though I have the same graphs

951
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:38,950
so the way how I want to get around this is to consider all possible permutations

952
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:44,290
right so I will consider all possible numberings or labelings of this graph and average

953
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:48,260
the likelihood of each one of them to get the final likelihood and

954
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:52,030
of course this won't work because there are n factorial of of these and if I want to

955
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:58,390
work with graphs of ten thousand nodes then this is ten to a million or something okay and

956
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:03,130
there is another problem which is just just the calculation even if somebody gives me the

957
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:09,190
permutation and the parameter matrix calculating this is still non nontrivial because it's quadratic in the size

958
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:14,190
of the graph right I need to go through trough every cell compare and multiply

959
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:18,890
this number so whenever I want to calculate this I need to go over n squared

960
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:24,990
number of operations and there are ways to get away so doing this naively would would

961
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:31,560
have this prohibitive complexity n factorial n square and you need n

962
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:36,490
factorial for graph isomorphism sort of testing because you need to consider all these labelings and

963
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:41,710
you need n n squared because you need to go through this two adjacency matrix cell by cell

964
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:46,470
and count how many I just match and how many don't and we have a way to do this

965
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:54,370
in linear time so now I show you how to do this very quickly and then we have a nice paper where

966
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:59,280
where the details will be clear but the idea is the idea is for

967
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,460
for labelings the idea is we we won't go through all the labelings

968
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:07,070
but we'll just check some of the important labelings so the idea is to go

969
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:11,830
and sample the labelings right so we are sort of you can think of it as as

970
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,160
doing some kind of simulated annealing over the labelings and this way we are

971
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:21,070
able to calculate the likelihood or the the derivative of the likelihood efficiently

972
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:26,230
and I want to leave it here so this is called metropolis sampling we'll start with

973
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:30,830
with some random permutation do do do do local moves on the permutation so

974
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:37,370
right we will be making swaps on the node labels and recalculating the likelihood

975
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:42,530
and ja so for example like this I will go I will pick two

976
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:48,930
nodes and change their labels this will change my adjacency matrix right the two rows and two columns will rotate

977
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:57,950
recalculate the likelihood and there is another thing that comes out of this right so

978
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:02,470
only only only thing that we need to do is only swap two rows and columns

979
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:07,480
but that they were

980
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:10,650
of course

981
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,150
o images that can

982
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:20,140
have only

983
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:22,460
on the

984
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:28,240
the only way to make a one hundred million gallons of the

985
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:31,570
following this

986
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:35,460
there also the when you objective

987
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,200
it could be a

988
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,560
it may been there

989
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,460
of course

990
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,900
i that's

991
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,800
OK by you

992
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,090
they essentially

993
00:58:55,100 --> 00:59:01,810
that i have shown

994
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:27,610
so as such by

995
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:36,420
the but they went

996
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:38,280
the get

997
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:45,340
and my

998
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:53,260
no of course

999
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:57,340
for example

1000
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:06,310
the last three

1001
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,570
we do it like that

1002
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,360
all right

1003
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:24,350
and and actually i think they

1004
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,010
they believe

1005
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:49,780
i don't want to know

1006
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:54,450
it stated basically every textbook i don't know it's singer textbook which explicitly states which

1007
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:58,640
technology bronze medalist but that's actually what the text was written

1008
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,490
because it turns out that if this set is the set here is in fact

1009
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:04,660
tried it is infinite so

1010
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,530
but there's different kind of infinite sets

1011
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,120
countable and uncountable

1012
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,070
and if the set is countable

1013
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:15,280
then refine sigma algebra on which this measure is defined which is implicitly defined by

1014
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,050
the proof of this theorem

1015
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,890
and the sigma algebra is

1016
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:23,340
it is useful sigmod rather we can actually reverse it's exactly the kind of forensic

1017
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,300
my brother would like to work with

1018
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,220
but it turns out that if the set is uncountable

1019
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,850
then the sigma algebra on which this measure lift and therefore this measure as well

1020
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:32,950
is basically

1021
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:36,240
and so

1022
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:41,510
in particular in the uncountable case the sigmod but does not include the one point

1023
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:45,660
we can't put probability two and one points and that's not the same as saying

1024
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,010
we can't it all the one point sets of zero probability

1025
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:50,030
it means that

1026
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:55,240
putting the one point set into the probability measure simply undefined probability measure see that

1027
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,350
and the problem here is that this this sigma algebra is is too coarse

1028
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:01,220
its resolution is fine

1029
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:04,660
the situation for that is if you

1030
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,820
if you think of this

1031
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:11,760
if you think of this picture here again

1032
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,340
basically you have an infinite dimensional space here

1033
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:18,030
and this sigma algebra that you get

1034
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:22,090
on which this measure lift is generated by the sets so basically you start with

1035
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,180
all the all sets that look like this

1036
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,510
which have finite adaptive are defined by a finite dimensional marginal so this year is

1037
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,240
finite dimensional

1038
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,740
then you apply this sigma algebra operations

1039
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,300
to them and combine them into countable intersections complements and so on

1040
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:41,090
and c and takes sigmod above all sets that you can produce in that way

1041
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,890
and intuitively speaking if

1042
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:48,780
since the signature operations always countable

1043
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,490
we can use it to produce

1044
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:54,660
we can use it to produce sets were very where this is nontrivial number this

1045
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,510
is non trivial subspaces count

1046
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:01,660
but still is an overall space which is uncommon which is much much much larger

1047
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,840
so what that means is these these these sets that we can produce and that

1048
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:10,590
we can put her abilities on are basically sets which are which are non-trivial unaccountable

1049
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:12,570
number of directions

1050
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:17,010
and look like it's in all other directions are in terms of random variables

1051
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,550
that means if you

1052
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:24,010
each dimension corresponds to one random variables in our infinite vector right

1053
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:29,200
and if we have a non-trivial shape here in some directions some number of dimensions

1054
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:33,510
and for the corresponding random variables we can make nontrivial statements like they take a

1055
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:38,010
value in the set between this value and this like that if the set looks

1056
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:42,490
like a cylinder for in the direction corresponding to one random variable simply says random

1057
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:44,800
variable takes some value in space

1058
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,070
so that's that's attributed statement so

1059
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:53,200
what this allows us to this allows us to to put probabilities on events that

1060
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,090
let's say something about a countable subset of the random variables

1061
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,950
but not about already

1062
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:02,490
in particular we can say if we want to have a one point set we

1063
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:05,070
if want to stay around takes one particular

1064
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:06,720
o point as its value

1065
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:11,140
then we have to make a statement about every single entry in this long

1066
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:34,160
four for almost anything you want to do you want to be able to measure

1067
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,350
the singletons

1068
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,470
if you this this is

1069
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:42,910
these sets really look like like the sets that you can put the probability on

1070
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:47,260
really look like in long cylinders but i think you are actually i think

1071
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,510
maybe maybe

1072
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:51,030
standing in terms of random variables is better

1073
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:54,470
if you if you think of a random draw from this as a function

1074
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:58,410
and then you can only say you can only give the probability to the event

1075
01:04:58,450 --> 01:04:59,990
that this function

1076
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:05,140
take certain values and a countable number of points but you can't say anything about

1077
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,070
the overall function

1078
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:12,260
well OK if you if you're happy with that purpose quite well

1079
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:16,610
there are actually you actually always have to reverse congo

1080
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:21,950
but basically you start from this and then in order to if this is uncountable

1081
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:25,530
then you have to make like a second step to turn image into something useful

1082
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:35,430
as a lot of people

1083
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:42,160
my guess you might you might but for gaussianprocess process for example you would like

1084
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,160
to say something about say the probability that

1085
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,450
that you draw one particular function

1086
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:50,490
even though problem is there are you want to condition on

1087
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:52,410
that's something you can do it here

1088
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:57,470
very quickly i can't really tell you how to fix this problem because this is

1089
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:59,530
where things get really quite difficult

1090
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:00,640
you really have to

1091
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,950
starting quite a really a lot of map

1092
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:06,200
and also there's there's i'm not aware of any

1093
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:08,260
kind of unified way

1094
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:11,030
two to fix this problem for all

1095
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:14,160
for all processes that you might want to to construct

1096
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,490
so you know there's there's one way to fix it for constructions of agustin process

1097
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:21,740
so it it doesn't depend on the process depends on the space

1098
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,590
down but

1099
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:27,010
in the gaussianprocess set up this one way to do it in the process and

1100
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:29,800
this another way to do it and i don't know of any way to to

1101
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,370
unify the

1102
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:37,370
but basically the the intuition is is again the situation that for example for continuous

1103
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:42,320
they are completely defined on on a on a countable subset

1104
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:44,760
of our unconscious

1105
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:48,160
and we're not really interested me want to define something like girls process we're not

1106
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,570
really interested in defining measure on arbitrary functions from the real unto itself

1107
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:56,300
because almost all of these functions are seen to jump at every single point

1108
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,720
we can work with that we're interested in is you know

1109
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,850
continuous functions may be piecewise continuous functions

1110
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:03,590
and in the sense here

1111
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:06,200
continuous and piecewise continuous functions have

1112
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:10,120
countable complexity havoc on the the number of degrees of freedom

1113
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:14,470
and how we leverage that is a difficult question because the space of this this

1114
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:19,010
product space setting doesn't doesn't really apply anymore you can simply write the space of

1115
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:23,070
continuous functions as the product space you can embed them in the product space

1116
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:26,820
but then they are basically like like the cloud of points in this products

1117
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:32,340
there are techniques for starting with common goal of construction on the product space and

1118
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:36,010
then restricting you measure to the subspace but you have you have to take into

1119
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,990
account how sigma algebra looks you have to take into account quite a bit of

1120
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:47,990
and similarly for similar techniques are applicable for probability measures we also make an argument

1121
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:52,350
a bit like actually in the common theorem itself that they are defined by by

1122
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:55,680
their values on account of the subsystem of the signal

1123
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,660
so the idea is always like find something comparable completely defined

1124
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,800
defines the probability measure and use that

1125
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:06,110
to get around this problem is uncountable dimensions

1126
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,990
that's the gist of it

1127
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:12,180
OK now in

1128
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,370
fifteen minutes

1129
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:19,120
let me say a few words at least about

1130
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:22,610
something that you that you can do with this and this is where

1131
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,970
this were my work starts so

1132
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:31,860
we find formula this set

1133
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,710
well well the practice the answer to that question is that

1134
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:44,550
you get more and the new terminate the program because the authorities for not well

1135
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,050
you don't know

1136
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,200
that there is

1137
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,630
whether this plan or not

1138
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:55,830
the only one only one that you know that this plan noticed that you actually

1139
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:56,900
want to plan

1140
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:01,610
you're right selling his soul

1141
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:04,910
that you know that you have

1142
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:06,780
about all possible class

1143
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,480
and this is for us to link

1144
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:15,000
equals the maximum possible roughly equal the number of states in your

1145
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:16,570
the problem

1146
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:19,200
and this typical is like this or

1147
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:22,900
hundreds of millions or whatever and what i can imagine

1148
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,580
in practice you can be

1149
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:27,140
this thing

1150
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:31,360
so the only thing is that it's just run the school and you find something

1151
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,830
but you don't know what they supply

1152
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,520
so there's not

1153
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:40,610
practical it

1154
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:46,860
so in this example here you generate homeless plan is zero one

1155
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:48,450
three four

1156
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:51,480
all of these form laws

1157
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:54,970
unsatisfiable simply by

1158
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:58,350
the university also

1159
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,130
unit clauses in the results the formula

1160
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,250
for the initial state and

1161
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:10,920
if the goal is to construct an awful it also one of the only that's

1162
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,460
also also

1163
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:19,450
in many cases allows you to infer that it's impossible to leeds

1164
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:23,980
from the initial state by short

1165
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:25,730
so this is the case of

1166
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:32,590
what are planning i the satisfiable

1167
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,540
this fun

1168
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:41,600
after of really three is so in the next slides

1169
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:44,070
it was something planned

1170
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:49,370
i have access or seven access depending weights

1171
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:52,540
satisfying valuation is that going one

1172
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,700
the optimal play with the band that has the smallest number

1173
01:10:56,730 --> 01:11:01,370
actions as well that is most

1174
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:10,450
so what happens is that the SAT solver

1175
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,570
yes the

1176
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:12,720
well the

1177
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:16,890
SAT solvers can be understood as

1178
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:21,070
maintaining partial evaluation of the

1179
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:24,000
process variables

1180
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:27,900
these the ecology

1181
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:31,770
correspond to the unit clauses in the origin of online

1182
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:37,210
well if you have be developed well before the actual search task consists of unit

1183
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:40,050
clauses in your example formula plus

1184
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:47,030
then unit clauses opened by interaction so things that can be

1185
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,770
we now planning problem

1186
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:51,900
well i'm only showing the variables

1187
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:54,570
corresponding the state variables the

1188
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,780
variables for the axis of course

1189
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,930
are one of

1190
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:04,010
column here

1191
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:08,970
so the values of the state variables at time point zero which is the initial

1192
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:10,750
states of the

1193
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:13,650
initial goal values of the

1194
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:17,040
there is also

1195
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:21,770
so the initial state what i what i sort of feel like for example

1196
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:26,870
and he are clear

1197
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:29,960
so these are two works that

1198
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:32,510
clear on top of the stack

1199
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:36,210
then the remaining of your relation

1200
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:40,970
based on a system b

1201
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:44,820
so the

1202
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,980
looks a and b

1203
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,550
one is very proud of is

1204
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:58,680
so first of course corresponds the initial state and

1205
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:01,530
the call for fun

1206
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:04,630
you can see that it be on be

1207
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,890
so a b see

1208
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,180
c and b

1209
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:10,510
and dr

1210
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,770
and in

1211
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,470
all the remaining

1212
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:17,740
values of the process variables

1213
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:23,890
we need to show was the typically what you know that

1214
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:26,550
in the initial state something is true

1215
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:29,030
and none of the actions

1216
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:32,490
the preconditions of all the actions that change the value of that

1217
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,860
state variable falls

1218
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:40,030
none of those actions can be taken so also in the next timepoint one

1219
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:45,540
that they have the same so that's why we have been able to to infer

1220
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:46,880
a lot

1221
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:51,860
process variables

1222
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,560
so this is the

1223
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:57,740
data sets off before in the first place

1224
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:01,340
and what being said so

1225
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:04,220
does this situation that's not

1226
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,350
falsified any part of any of the classes

1227
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:10,410
in the in the south problem yet

1228
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:12,350
and some of the data

1229
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:13,130
most people

1230
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:17,640
i don't know about so it doesn't know whether this formula is satisfiable

1231
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:20,280
so article tries to make

1232
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:23,480
the evaluation of complicated

1233
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,530
so either

1234
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:30,420
satisfy all the clauses or to derive the course or not know what

1235
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:34,530
this that's or in this case

1236
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:39,050
well there are several choices which were believed would have chosen for browsing

1237
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,670
it's always variable here b

1238
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:46,090
and i mean that was one of the

1239
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:49,150
they have also been value

1240
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:54,980
in the world in order to search for this that's what's going through

1241
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,520
not that they able post chosen

1242
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:03,430
it's not red on the of their

1243
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:06,790
decided to make the

1244
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:08,760
process there was

1245
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:09,810
so what

1246
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:11,210
are going round italy

1247
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:13,950
not be one

1248
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:22,490
making the decision have one mil one unit clause to continue nutritional

1249
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:26,530
so i clicked game and you see that we're left with no

1250
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:30,180
unsatisfiable classes

1251
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:45,050
so if the ontology

1252
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:56,470
before the

1253
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:10,990
some new work on fine grained justifications

1254
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:14,010
any questions on justifications are repaired

1255
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:21,030
so an example is seen here is a good question we just we just take

1256
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:27,590
it's very removing one axiom from each justifications for deleting axioms from the ontology this

1257
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:29,640
may you'll see that this is a

1258
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:32,390
the problem in some sense is required to the next part

1259
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:38,300
but could also rewrite the axioms in a certain way so that we didn't lose

1260
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:43,430
all the information in that play more realistic scenario this is common in the repair

1261
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:49,990
we've got axiom we incoming which is essentially right section so that it the right

1262
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:55,240
enough you can select one of the rewriting so that entailments broken

1263
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:59,570
or will play at some support for going on directly editing the axioms

1264
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:02,300
we saw in the example sometimes we have to do you want to just delete

1265
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:06,590
the actions made some cocoa can drag and drop problem or whatever

1266
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,740
an ontology we didn't realize about stealing classified everything turn red

1267
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:15,070
and we go back to pinpoint reason why i'm complicated we did that

1268
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:20,680
OK got any other questions

1269
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:26,510
now i want to talk about some kind of the kind of justifications

1270
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:30,860
and i want to just talk about some issues that justifications half so the first

1271
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:32,800
of these is superfluousness

1272
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,490
so one of

1273
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:37,340
if we just recall

1274
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:42,600
one of the nice things about

1275
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:45,970
o justifications was that they

1276
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:50,720
i took a large set of axioms they now these down into a small set

1277
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,530
of axioms to focus on so before

1278
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:54,470
we we

1279
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:59,890
have clue maybe which action is responsible for the interment particularly through multiple particularly

1280
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:04,450
if there are multiple reasons and i think about justification is that it take the

1281
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:07,820
axioms playing a handful of very large ontology

1282
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:12,490
and now sits down and we can focus on this nice small subset

1283
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:14,390
but the problem here is

1284
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:19,590
the main parts of axioms that are actually responsible

1285
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,410
for the given entailment

1286
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:26,240
that would a good justification for to be superfluous parts

1287
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,720
what we really like is

1288
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:33,040
just to identify the parts of the axioms that are responsible for home and discovered

1289
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:37,740
the superfluous parts in some sense because it is superfluous parts

1290
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:42,430
can the hunt for our understanding we might if we got larger ssific ation and

1291
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:47,010
justifications can in realistic ontologies that we've looked at can sometimes be over twenty axioms

1292
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:50,340
to twenty actions in size

1293
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:55,820
and sometimes they contain very long axioms people we find that people of some people

1294
01:18:56,030 --> 01:19:00,030
we've added some tools like push a open like rising very very long that the

1295
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:05,760
axioms axioms containing class descriptions and some of these contain superfluous parts of for trying

1296
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:10,800
to understand the reason for justification and they have some contain superfluous parts my distractors

1297
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,550
from really focusing on the past that matters and this is one reason and then

1298
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:17,320
if we come to repair ontology

1299
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:21,870
if we were to remove one axiom completely may be moving too much

1300
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,340
so if

1301
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:26,320
so we had something that was superfluous entailment we might actually want to keep this

1302
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:31,120
this might be a valid model with whom i valid modelling going on here

1303
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:34,700
might to keep this again would like to really know for sure

1304
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:40,150
which part of the axioms in the justifications are required to support entailments which parts

1305
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:48,760
so here is a small small example for you here we have

1306
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:51,910
the justification for

1307
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:55,340
d being unsatisfiable

1308
01:19:55,340 --> 01:20:00,430
and in this justification we have the audience is supposed to be business of clusters

1309
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:02,090
exist RC

1310
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,910
and across the frolov bottom

1311
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:09,510
and in this case for the purposes of entailment this

1312
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:12,370
the disjunction left inside the first axiom

1313
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:15,010
it's superfluous we don't need it for the entailment

1314
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:16,200
and also

1315
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,510
for the second axiom

1316
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:22,430
the failure of this restriction c is also superfluous for the entailment so we only

1317
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:26,490
need to know it is of course the b and b is a subclass of

1318
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:29,970
least one everything that needs to be at least one also to that we don't

1319
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:33,560
so the follows the possible worlds semantics

1320
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:38,450
so i will use that to illustrate the meaning of query and the meaning of

1321
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:43,960
the results and now we talk about how to do the koran to efficiently

1322
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:49,790
first of all i will introduce some indexes sponsored in data one i will introduce

1323
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:54,560
one example for the answer numeric data and one for categorical data

1324
01:20:54,580 --> 01:21:01,810
so this is the tree introduced by professor in hong kong is published in two

1325
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:03,550
thousand five so

1326
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:10,630
it to be particularly handles the numerical data and the probabilistic threshold queries

1327
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:18,130
so let's take example here we have four hundred and after with arbitrary shape

1328
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:22,560
and i the jury within the possible area

1329
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:25,620
so if we have query range

1330
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:27,200
kill here

1331
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:32,140
so we want to find out as objects who lives in the currie range with

1332
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:36,970
a large probability lists zero point five

1333
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:40,190
so how to solve such inquiry

1334
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:45,830
first of all we want to compute the probability that object lies in query range

1335
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:49,500
which is the cause of pure with probability

1336
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:53,990
for example if we want to compute the probability that c lies inquiring range q

1337
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:00,920
how to compute that we just use the integral of PDF of c which can

1338
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:06,440
be arbitrary on the the intersection of c and q

1339
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:13,000
as we see here that computation could be quite quite costly so the goal of

1340
01:22:13,190 --> 01:22:18,670
tree is to do the car answering and try to avoid this computation of appearance

1341
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:22,670
probability as much as possible

1342
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:25,690
so let's give you an idea of you treat

1343
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:31,410
first of all this is that object keep all with very arbitrary shape

1344
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:36,350
and in order to do the in order to add some additional information to help

1345
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:39,710
car answering we do the fall falling things

1346
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:44,350
first of all we partition that they adopted horizontally

1347
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:46,290
so the poses the to the object

1348
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:52,560
we first partition them horizontally so that we we have three parts

1349
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,590
the latter part of the object

1350
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:57,590
its probability is exactly p

1351
01:22:57,630 --> 01:23:00,000
p can be specified by the user

1352
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:03,780
and the right part is often also exactly p

1353
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,900
so i think it's projected into the

1354
01:23:08,690 --> 01:23:10,030
and so it's

1355
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:12,940
one dimension which is easy to compute

1356
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,220
and we also partition the data vertically

1357
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:22,750
also the lower part is p and the probability of the other parties of p

1358
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:24,720
so how to help car answering

1359
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:29,160
suppose we are we already have the partition and we have another query

1360
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,410
thank you

1361
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:33,130
the current range is the pink orange

1362
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:37,410
and as such hold is tau which is zero point eight

1363
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:39,590
so from this we can see that

1364
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:43,190
the current range is disjoint with the right part

1365
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:45,630
with probability zero point two

1366
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:49,000
so which means that the probability of the intersection

1367
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:49,780
it is

1368
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:52,560
o is smaller than their point eight

1369
01:23:56,350 --> 01:24:00,970
we could see that because we we can draw the conclusion without compute it's real

1370
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:06,900
problem at all probability so we can prove the pop up to all safely

1371
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,380
throughout got to the range query

1372
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:15,250
that's how we use the idea the partition to help from the primary for an

1373
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,940
and also can be used to validate object

1374
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:24,250
so with the help of the partition and the minimum bombing range

1375
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:27,500
this is the minimum ponderings of the object

1376
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,560
so the post we have

1377
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:35,480
probability range query q that carry range is that pink our

1378
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:40,560
critically it covers the minimal bombing range

1379
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:46,180
and the horizontally it covers right part whose probability zero point two

1380
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:52,060
so by only looking to the two dimensions separately we know that the probability of

1381
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:56,150
the intersection is greater than zero point two

1382
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:02,370
so we could we could safely put this object into set without computing the probability

1383
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,760
so this is the idea of how to about that it was adopted without can

1384
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:09,100
the computation

1385
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,180
so that we know that if we

1386
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:17,620
the partition with respect to certain p it can only help some inquiries

1387
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:21,760
so when we want to do the partition a few times the wall currents can

1388
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,170
be helped

1389
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:27,830
that's why we let set of p and computer that partitions

1390
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,260
and the the punisher were presented by the

1391
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:36,920
rectangle just inside it's called the probability probabilistic constant region

1392
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:40,530
so what information we want to start

1393
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:45,920
it's just to all those rectangles about the object

1394
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:51,650
and to organize the information we use are like structure is called UP tree so

1395
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:56,970
you only know that it contends that this address of the object the minimum bounding

1396
01:25:57,090 --> 01:26:01,050
rectangle and the set of PCR we computed

1397
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:06,970
and a is the intermediate node we in index the pointer to the child nodes

1398
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:09,840
and as the minimum bounding range of PC

1399
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:13,740
so instead of that likely are two we have them in morning and followed that

1400
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:18,220
up to here we for the PCI because so we want to help the range

1401
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:21,720
powerful for probabilistic data

1402
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:29,170
so the current evaluation is quite similar to the correlation in archery we just search

1403
01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:31,490
from the root note and in the e

1404
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:37,730
each intermediate entry we just try to check if the car is destroyed or overlap

1405
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:41,180
with the minimum bounding rectangle the PC

1406
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:45,470
so this is the idea of you treat

1407
01:26:45,490 --> 01:26:48,090
but in some application area

1408
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:52,720
we do not really have an answer to newmarket data instead of the data is

1409
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:56,720
for example this them this is

1410
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:02,180
car repairing record one two record is the problem of car

1411
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:06,530
but we will not pretty sure which probably exactly is

1412
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:11,420
so we have a field possible values for the problem of car

1413
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:15,680
for example t one whose problem is break

1414
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:18,390
and the confidence is zero point five

1415
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:23,170
and the tyre with confidence point five which means the problem this car is that

1416
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:27,510
at the break of time each have their point for probability

1417
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,580
so our user may want to ask what we want to find the temples whose

1418
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:37,410
problem is break with probability there seem to point three and the tyre with probability

1419
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:39,120
there are playing field

1420
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:39,960
so here

1421
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:47,370
the query is represented by a few possible values and uncertain attribute with their confidence

1422
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:52,330
and what we want to find is that couples who can match the query with

1423
01:27:52,330 --> 01:27:54,030
a large probability

1424
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:58,740
and large probability is represented by the threshold to o point seven

1425
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:05,300
for example we compared to one and query we compute the probability of their matches

1426
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:07,470
so really

1427
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:12,200
it's more like this usually goes in this order well

1428
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:16,310
i mean it's it's like what we want to know the answers to these questions

1429
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:21,040
we want to know what is what we ultimately want to know what is good

1430
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:26,100
what's a good filter to choose

1431
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:33,480
we would like to be symmetric with good properties that

1432
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:38,170
we would like to produce a nice solution in fact would like to produce smooth

1433
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:40,710
for pretty reasonably small solution

1434
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:43,700
we would like the solution to be useful

1435
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:50,600
to have this approximating power because what do we do with with function we

1436
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:53,220
so here's what we hope

1437
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:57,070
we hope that this basically zero captures

1438
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:00,360
quite successfully our signal

1439
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:04,940
continuous time now so captures the typical signals

1440
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:08,670
of course if it's really difficult signal to capture then it's we're going to need

1441
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:12,400
more of the details but what we hope is

1442
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:15,150
we hope we

1443
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:17,240
i hope to choose a zero

1444
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:20,950
so that

1445
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,920
so there are

1446
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:27,180
we can say that in many ways a continuous time i can hope to choose

1447
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:34,710
a zero so that he is a really good approximation to bicycle

1448
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:38,100
maybe try to match my signal well actually here

1449
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:41,610
you're specifying it's the function fy

1450
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:47,150
raises the tricky question is really never got result suppose we wanted to

1451
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:51,780
suppose i signal we're looking for is like a tank

1452
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:53,690
the shape of the tank

1453
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,590
so you might say well

1454
01:29:57,730 --> 01:29:59,670
shows fee

1455
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:03,040
to look like a tank

1456
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:06,200
it will be shown

1457
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:12,100
by by using these functions as a basis will

1458
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:15,360
we will capture tank if

1459
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:18,410
which shape of the tank

1460
01:30:18,430 --> 01:30:20,950
i have no idea what ages

1461
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,600
what give such a thing

1462
01:30:24,890 --> 01:30:27,790
somehow the direction hasn't been very fruitful

1463
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,920
we are more likely to ask

1464
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:34,680
one feature is a good approximation to

1465
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:36,890
reasonable shapes

1466
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:39,410
good approximation to reason

1467
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:40,420
and then

1468
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,210
five it's a great

1469
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:45,910
these are all very good questions

1470
01:30:45,970 --> 01:30:51,110
after the war

1471
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:56,590
these features or the function phi

1472
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:57,900
let's see

1473
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,580
well first of all

1474
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:07,470
teachers are finite feel automatically find the length is just matches five three features in

1475
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:08,590
this example

1476
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:13,180
the feature will go from zero to two

1477
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:14,620
and that's the kind of

1478
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:16,330
the first surprise

1479
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:19,080
about the solutions to this equation

1480
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:26,230
have finite life becomes zero

1481
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:28,170
the solutions of

1482
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:30,260
differential equations generally

1483
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:32,130
go up exponentially with the

1484
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,190
exponentially but don't

1485
01:31:34,210 --> 01:31:35,420
cut off

1486
01:31:35,470 --> 01:31:36,900
it's the

1487
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:41,050
that's only possible because these two scales in here

1488
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:46,810
well that somehow somewhere in the number of terms so he will go from zero

1489
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:51,900
in our function will also go from zero

1490
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,880
that's pretty neat

1491
01:31:57,330 --> 01:32:01,640
i guess the answer do we don't have to stay with

1492
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,610
finite length

1493
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:09,880
i mean but that course find like functions correspond to finite length filters is sort

1494
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:11,990
of natural starting place

1495
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:14,320
o but then have no

1496
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:17,510
the first keep coming in of constructions that

1497
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:20,240
right down to this old and say well

1498
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:23,530
let's use infinite length filters

1499
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:26,110
get more freedom in the function

1500
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:27,760
it's a

1501
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:33,720
let me just mention one another example i was going to mention two

1502
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:37,400
two or three other examples OK there's

1503
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:38,990
this the challenge

1504
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:41,880
suppose i look at this

1505
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:47,590
particular dilation equation

1506
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:51,050
just that

1507
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:54,930
what's the filter that goes with what's the

1508
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:58,130
it's not one of the coefficients

1509
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:02,090
on the right hand side there

1510
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:04,640
well there's only one coefficient

1511
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,990
and that's what

1512
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,700
fact two is the two

1513
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:12,660
OK so there is

1514
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:15,700
please that's called alwasy felt

1515
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:17,570
it doesn't do anything at all

1516
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:21,950
just i

1517
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:27,380
right pre-defined five matrix is a matrix of one on the diagonal

1518
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:29,640
if i do the convolution

1519
01:33:29,660 --> 01:33:31,430
nothing happens

1520
01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:35,510
now tell me what's the

1521
01:33:35,530 --> 01:33:36,910
the scaling function

1522
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:42,700
that's the right for fifty years scaling function i don't think i don't believe me

1523
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:46,360
these are scaling

1524
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:49,590
not especially early by the way

1525
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:56,950
know what function solves that

1526
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:58,610
delta quite

1527
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:00,090
delta question

1528
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:02,910
which i would like news to me

1529
01:34:02,910 --> 01:34:05,180
sophie in t

1530
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:07,990
delta two

1531
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:13,200
that's kind of funny i never really thought about delta two t or something and

1532
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,680
maybe we should think about this

1533
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,240
why why

1534
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:22,370
because then you can do anything

1535
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:23,800
and you can be

1536
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:28,130
part of those very rare people who can put it all together

1537
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:31,780
i was just the seventieth birthday party or when jacobs

1538
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,710
this past week

1539
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:38,950
and when jacobs is the CEO of qualcomm

1540
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,570
which is the company that started to build

1541
01:34:42,630 --> 01:34:45,980
CDMA wireless systems

1542
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:49,490
for a long time the CDMA systems

1543
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,000
were thought to have

1544
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:53,920
that's probably better

1545
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,470
in TTMM ANF TMI

1546
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:59,220
but much more expensive

1547
01:34:59,230 --> 01:35:01,340
and eventually

1548
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:06,020
or in the situation where all the new systems being designed or are using CT

1549
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:11,180
as result of this sermon jacobs is a very wealthy person

1550
01:35:11,190 --> 01:35:13,050
we went to a symphony

1551
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,600
friday night out in san diego

1552
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:18,540
which was given specifically for him

1553
01:35:18,590 --> 01:35:23,450
partly because he just given one hundred ten million dollars to the san diego symphony

1554
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:28,290
so you can figure from that that he's fairly wealthy

1555
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:31,440
well the point of all of that is he started out as a faculty member

1556
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:36,910
he was one of the authors of wasn't crafting jacobs which is the

1557
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:40,030
which is sort of the bible

1558
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:43,100
of digital communication systems

1559
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:47,640
from the sixties and people still use it is still an excellent book

1560
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:51,840
and in doing that he really learned the communication trade

1561
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:58,600
from soup to i guess you can nazis the way we put it now

1562
01:35:58,610 --> 01:36:03,040
and then he could do the whole thing because he could do the whole thing

1563
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:09,490
because he understood coding because he understood modulation because he understood channels this is why

1564
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:12,700
you could design systems are really work

1565
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:16,780
i was talking to the chief technology officer out there

1566
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,990
and the chief technology officer said it was really very easy

1567
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,210
because they're meant that all of them himself

1568
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:25,680
and he still does it

1569
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:26,560
OK so

1570
01:36:26,590 --> 01:36:30,870
so it really makes sense to know something about all of these pieces

1571
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:32,780
if you want to become a billionaire

1572
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:35,300
if you want to become a billionaire without

1573
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:36,990
without cheating

1574
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:40,110
now many people become billionaires by cheating

1575
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:43,010
and you for many of them but

1576
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:45,280
anyway and after that

1577
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:49,260
i mean that was really wanna be billionaires and and anyway this

1578
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:51,630
but i think i mean there's nothing you can do with more than a a

1579
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:53,160
billion dollars right

1580
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:57,080
it's always

1581
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,240
let's move on

1582
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:06,850
we've gotten rid of digital coding saying we're not going to deal with that here

1583
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:12,860
let me take the PAAM out of here because i only say what it is

1584
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:21,620
if we take this box i call modulation before which was one of the one

1585
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:23,750
of the two main pieces

1586
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,280
the channel encoder

1587
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:29,990
we can break it down into two pieces

1588
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:33,020
namely namely we're going to be layering things again

1589
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:37,340
we start out with a symbol sequence which is what comes out of the encoder

1590
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:38,850
which is usually just

1591
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,030
just a short sequence of binary digits

1592
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:44,570
so the symbols can be thought of

1593
01:37:45,550 --> 01:37:47,430
s two binary digits

1594
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:50,030
in a sequence of four binary digits

1595
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:53,270
four six two possible binary digits or what have you

1596
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:55,670
and all of those are common

1597
01:37:55,710 --> 01:38:01,220
there's then a single constellation the turn symbols into signals

1598
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:04,340
now notation in the field

1599
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:07,250
totally non uniform

1600
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:08,780
because most people

1601
01:38:08,810 --> 01:38:10,380
use symbols

1602
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:13,310
and sequences and waveforms

1603
01:38:13,330 --> 01:38:15,080
and binary

1604
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:16,810
and two poles

1605
01:38:16,820 --> 01:38:19,100
all totally anonymously

1606
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:22,510
and the station will try to make here

1607
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:23,860
is the symbols

1608
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:26,000
things like binary digits

1609
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:28,950
but don't have any numerical

1610
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:31,020
meaning to them

1611
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:32,980
i mean no one zero

1612
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:37,740
the only thing important there is that one zero are different from each other

1613
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:42,570
all computer scientists call ones and zeros alice's and bob's

1614
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:48,370
lots of other people calling plus one to minus one doesn't make any difference what

1615
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:50,380
you call it it's just

1616
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:53,630
an alphabet with two values and

1617
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:58,290
we talk about saying also we're talking about numerical values

1618
01:38:58,370 --> 01:39:04,180
so in fact you could have a single constellation with two elements and were what

1619
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:07,130
you're doing is mapping one zero

1620
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:12,570
in two plus one minus one now that's a pretty silly kind of situations but

1621
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:16,980
it still has the value of saying you're turning things

1622
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:23,070
where is just an alphabet size two into something where you're saying these are numerical

1623
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:28,870
values and you're interested in the difference between numerical values and the difference is measured

1624
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:31,410
in the ordinary way

1625
01:39:31,410 --> 01:39:34,480
measuring difference four numerical values

1626
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:40,790
who are these can be vectors also bit vectors in an inner product space were

1627
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:45,870
again you have lied and you have distance you have numerical values here you don't

1628
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:47,790
have numerical values here

1629
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:50,800
so we want to talk about how you do this

1630
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,890
and then

1631
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:57,330
for the most part we're going to define modulation is what happens when you go

1632
01:39:57,330 --> 01:39:59,430
from the signal sequence

1633
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,500
to the waveform

1634
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:04,070
you might realise that our notation

1635
01:40:04,130 --> 01:40:05,770
is lousy here

1636
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:12,720
because i'm calling modulation this whole thing and i'm also calling modulation just this thing

1637
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:18,670
i'm doing that because there doesn't seem to be any other reasonable word for either

1638
01:40:18,670 --> 01:40:20,470
one of these things

1639
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:23,850
i'm gonna later split this into two pieces also

1640
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:30,260
but that will come later so anyway we're going from symbols the signals to waveforms

1641
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:36,810
might look remarkably similar to what we did was sources we just it backwards what

1642
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:38,860
sources we went from waveforms

1643
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:41,810
o two signals the symbols there

1644
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:46,680
the explanation would be this perhaps some genetic defects mutation

1645
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:47,390
all right

1646
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:49,640
that would make you crave nicotine

1647
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:52,070
and also make you get lung cancer

1648
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,910
i actually think at one time the

1649
01:40:54,960 --> 01:41:00,340
so cigarette manufacturers what we're arguing this point never seen that somewhere

1650
01:41:00,390 --> 01:41:02,890
but again this was just x and y

1651
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:06,390
that explanations as good as others they always make

1652
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:10,650
smoking and lung cancer correlated

1653
01:41:11,910 --> 01:41:17,960
it seems like you can learn causal influences from from correlation from passive data

1654
01:41:18,010 --> 01:41:24,240
but the problem here is that we only have data on two variables

1655
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,820
all right well will

1656
01:41:26,850 --> 01:41:31,910
in the nineties has shown that we can learn something about causal influences

1657
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:35,030
if we have data on at least four variables

1658
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:38,830
that it might seem while getting data and other variables

1659
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:44,780
other than smoking and lung cancer may enable you to conclude that smoking causes lung

1660
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,310
and that's is actually the purpose of this talk

1661
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,370
right well why that's the case

1662
01:41:50,410 --> 01:41:54,640
anyway if you have more data you can learn something

1663
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:58,970
first i need to define a causal graph

1664
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:04,120
in general when i have something written like this i'm not going to just say

1665
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:07,270
satellite like powerpoint presentations and and

1666
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:10,850
there's no point in saying what you can read or even necessary leaving it up

1667
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:12,210
to one another

1668
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:16,610
read what i want do is is go over examples more and you can come

1669
01:42:16,610 --> 01:42:20,350
back to these definitions later and

1670
01:42:20,370 --> 01:42:24,490
and look at them so in general not going to be reading these things

1671
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:29,160
here's here's what we mean by direct cause this is the study in rats by

1672
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,430
lugg et al nineteen ninety five

1673
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:36,210
they manipulated testosterone levels

1674
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:42,130
and found that they had a causal effect and DHT levels dehydratase testosterone

1675
01:42:42,210 --> 01:42:43,890
they also manipulated

1676
01:42:43,890 --> 01:42:46,510
testosterone levels they found that it had

1677
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:49,070
causal factor and erectile function

1678
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:51,780
so first faster on

1679
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:53,270
DHT levels

1680
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:56,380
found it also causes erectile function

1681
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:59,570
they manipulated DHT itself

1682
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:03,510
all right well testosterone fixed and found that it had

1683
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:04,400
and in fact

1684
01:43:04,410 --> 01:43:05,800
and erectile function

1685
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:07,840
so there's an error here

1686
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:10,650
now why didn't pietronero from t

1687
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:13,100
why is that there are missing

1688
01:43:13,110 --> 01:43:18,310
well because when they held DHT fixed and give them what they they held at

1689
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:22,890
it didn't matter whether testosterone was low or high

1690
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:26,510
the the level of erectile function was the same

1691
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:28,300
when they text is high

1692
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:29,640
the same thing

1693
01:43:29,650 --> 01:43:30,790
it didn't matter

1694
01:43:30,810 --> 01:43:35,790
whether what the testosterone levels erectile function levels were the same

1695
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:37,520
OK so

1696
01:43:38,110 --> 01:43:42,650
is not a direct cause of the that's why natural and nature by direct cause

1697
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,040
we mean there's no variable

1698
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:49,730
amongst the observed variables that mediates the causal factor

1699
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:55,090
now what if DHT wasn't one of observed variables will then there would be an

1700
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:59,480
error directly here so whether something is the direct cause in that is

1701
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:03,670
this dependent upon which the able to actually observing and we can argue falls off

1702
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:05,930
there's always some

1703
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:09,010
intermediate variables and things just

1704
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:13,890
you know unfolding in some sense way and we only as humans articulate certain variables

1705
01:44:13,890 --> 01:44:15,500
that we observe

1706
01:44:15,630 --> 01:44:18,710
right so that's what we mean by the red cross in the causal graph is

1707
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:21,510
a graph containing

1708
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:27,260
variables and edges that i direct classes

1709
01:44:27,290 --> 01:44:28,590
here's another thing

1710
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:33,070
just say right because the saying it isn't going to

1711
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:37,220
i'm have just accuracy how many people know the causal markov assumption and i'm going

1712
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:41,320
to get a feel for my audience

1713
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:47,740
so the majority are not really familiar with problem networks motivation networks right

1714
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:50,090
you're not

1715
01:44:50,140 --> 01:44:51,510
so fact that

1716
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,840
to me there are like

1717
01:44:53,860 --> 01:45:01,030
well causal networks special kind of asian network it's one where the parents represent causal

1718
01:45:06,510 --> 01:45:12,110
the station that we're just represents conditional independencies

1719
01:45:12,150 --> 01:45:16,660
and you don't necessarily given causal meaning but then a certain kind of patient that

1720
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:18,310
because the causal network

1721
01:45:18,340 --> 01:45:21,670
in other words it's a subset of all patient networks with the edges to represent

1722
01:45:22,870 --> 01:45:24,760
but in

1723
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:37,870
this is the most people don't know either in this audience

1724
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:41,730
so i'm going to this is part the causal markov assumption

1725
01:45:43,090 --> 01:45:47,440
and again i'm not going to read what i need to show it by examples

1726
01:45:47,460 --> 01:45:51,770
i don't know what's going on the bottom things this is the probability distribution satisfies

1727
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:54,340
the markov condition

1728
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:56,820
if the probability of each variable

1729
01:45:56,850 --> 01:46:01,610
is independent of its non descendants conditional on its parents

1730
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:07,490
and then we assume that the causal graph containing the variables satisfies that assumption we

1731
01:46:07,490 --> 01:46:10,010
make the causal markov assumption

1732
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:14,410
we get for whom

1733
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:16,440
can show

1734
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:48,920
which is that the people of one

1735
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:51,740
four years later

1736
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:03,190
they also

1737
01:47:13,150 --> 01:47:15,270
i mentioned the problem of the

1738
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:45,430
is people

1739
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:58,170
one of

1740
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:24,400
of course

1741
01:48:56,180 --> 01:49:02,510
how old are

1742
01:49:10,040 --> 01:49:11,710
all the

1743
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:27,190
we want

1744
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:43,200
we're not

1745
01:49:55,820 --> 01:49:59,270
use of

1746
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:33,720
o or one or more

1747
01:50:33,730 --> 01:50:39,230
all right

1748
01:50:44,530 --> 01:50:50,170
you know i

1749
01:51:06,150 --> 01:51:12,110
robert the world

1750
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:17,600
from the model

1751
01:51:29,070 --> 01:51:33,930
you know go

1752
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:43,890
one of his

1753
01:51:43,890 --> 01:51:47,740
the road to the point of incoming calls

1754
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:51,750
they can

1755
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:56,840
so more recently EPA human to design a car he did not catch because of

1756
01:51:57,980 --> 01:52:03,330
but you think the that the problem of parking not navigation your pocket because the

1757
01:52:03,330 --> 01:52:05,450
main difference is that every trade-off

1758
01:52:05,570 --> 01:52:07,000
some of listed here

1759
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:12,100
and so on what we did was also human driver to actually drive the car

1760
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:14,010
around the parking lot francis a

1761
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:18,620
started here i want to talk in that spot gigi there from you and just

1762
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:22,120
tell me how you do it driving nicely trying different styles

1763
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,610
and so on

1764
01:52:23,630 --> 01:52:29,180
you should algorithm on the training set parking lots and think about how human traits

1765
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:33,890
of these differences are as and they can take the car instance simulations in new

1766
01:52:33,890 --> 01:52:40,450
parking lot and here's one result if you have a human demonstrated nice driving style

1767
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:43,970
meaning in the opening also wrote trying to stay on the road and so on

1768
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:50,990
on this is the trajectory that he chooses to their

1769
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:54,610
and this is the seems pretty reasonable way

1770
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:56,830
to drive your car

1771
01:52:56,850 --> 01:53:00,190
he goes the park in nineteen forty

1772
01:53:00,370 --> 01:53:01,860
and of course

1773
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:06,040
just to show this is hard coded you also human demonstrate the driving styles one

1774
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:10,940
is called the sloppy driving style where you you know if you demonstrate cutting diagonally

1775
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:16,170
across the parking lot some was that then this is sort of

1776
01:53:16,350 --> 01:53:18,760
one of the you get words here

1777
01:53:18,830 --> 01:53:22,820
we have actually does planning as it as it is possible the map of the

1778
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:30,120
environment so this learned that should cut narrowly between those two cars in order to

1779
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:32,710
get quickly

1780
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:36,810
the last one of in some drivers required running backwards and so if you have

1781
01:53:36,810 --> 01:53:42,560
no if you have no aversion driving backwards and some people drivers backwards and forwards

1782
01:53:43,410 --> 01:53:45,590
then then

1783
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:47,840
actually does the

1784
01:53:47,860 --> 01:53:49,940
backing up

1785
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:53,370
and puts in a great position to

1786
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:59,660
this is just the sort of range of behavior you can learn using imitation using

1787
01:54:03,890 --> 01:54:10,340
can do so this is another fine example this zico kolter work

1788
01:54:10,350 --> 01:54:14,710
on some of and i think he was also a lot of so

1789
01:54:14,730 --> 01:54:20,370
for some problems it turns out to be very difficult to demonstrate exactly what to

1790
01:54:20,370 --> 01:54:23,880
do with the robot so give quite a robot like this turns out to be

1791
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:28,510
very difficult for human to sit down the joystick robot robot six leagues economy is

1792
01:54:28,510 --> 01:54:33,890
actually very hard for humans to demonstrate how to control quadruped robot like this

1793
01:54:33,940 --> 01:54:37,770
fact even given the reward function in terms of the planet completes the footsteps is

1794
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:40,710
very difficult very high dimensional problem

1795
01:54:40,710 --> 01:54:43,010
but taking a page from

1796
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:48,290
hierarchical reinforcement learning intersecting into hierarchical apprenticeship learning in the same way so here's what

1797
01:54:48,290 --> 01:54:49,600
i mean

1798
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:54,230
if you're doing for the planning for the control tasks we are probably going to

1799
01:54:54,230 --> 01:54:57,840
decompose the planet passes multiple levels of abstraction anyway

1800
01:54:57,940 --> 01:55:03,310
and so what we're going to do is also human to specify the demonstration the

1801
01:55:03,310 --> 01:55:05,540
same multiple levels of abstraction

1802
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:06,920
so here's what i mean

1803
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:10,950
if you want to solve the planning task again robot from the initial state to

1804
01:55:10,950 --> 01:55:16,560
a goal state gonna use hierarchical RL idea pioneered by his rich doing here and

1805
01:55:16,590 --> 01:55:22,630
i think is wrong and time director fields on and some high-level body motion planning

1806
01:55:22,630 --> 01:55:26,140
part we first two to be part of the problem of how they get from

1807
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:30,590
how they get my body roughly from from the initial state goal state and they

1808
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:34,540
also have a little tiny tiles of exactly how you place the feet to get

1809
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:36,120
from the initial state to a goal state

1810
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:41,760
and so given the decomposition of the robot dog problem to high level and low

1811
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:46,000
level tasks you can then ask the demonstrations of the same too high level and

1812
01:55:46,010 --> 01:55:50,370
low level tasks to complete the the high level it turns out that we expect

1813
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:54,540
on dolls like physical cause there is we can look at a map like this

1814
01:55:54,710 --> 01:55:58,990
this is the height map by the way with the lighter shades to higher places

1815
01:55:58,990 --> 01:56:03,380
and that in those locations that exposed

1816
01:56:03,410 --> 01:56:08,160
go well you should follow approximately this part the this demonstration of the higher level

1817
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:09,790
of abstraction

1818
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:14,360
and his demonstration of the low level of abstraction which is you should i say

1819
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:18,340
you know OK my doctor this position the height matter where feet are and have

1820
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:21,800
been explored the dark legs eco is you can actually look at this and say

1821
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:24,890
i think you should find that to that position

1822
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:29,460
so this turns out to be as all the demonstration that you know that there

1823
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:31,840
it's much easier for people to come up with

1824
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:37,490
and we put these together it turns out his attitude to equation listening to of

1825
01:56:37,510 --> 01:56:43,360
you can put these things together to learn a reward function for the everybody start

1826
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:48,600
get over difficult articles before i show you the result after learning that essentially show

1827
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:50,100
you the result of the

1828
01:56:50,110 --> 01:56:54,230
before learning result against this is on

1829
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:55,090
if the

1830
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:58,240
dog does not have the reward function

1831
01:56:58,260 --> 01:57:01,340
and this

1832
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:07,790
try to use central pattern generators step regular pattern the position

1833
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:10,270
it's part of the state

1834
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:23,590
this this failing dying motions always fun to watch

1835
01:57:23,610 --> 01:57:27,880
so there's this road was built by boston dynamics of is usually smaller

1836
01:57:36,130 --> 01:57:37,700
and so

1837
01:57:37,710 --> 01:57:41,070
and i should say this one more those examples are all i think are all

1838
01:57:41,410 --> 01:57:47,690
has had many successes by many crews in many different countries and on what is

1839
01:57:47,790 --> 01:57:52,340
like about this example is that we genuinely try lots of things were motivated to

1840
01:57:52,340 --> 01:57:56,230
do whether whether it takes to get the robot to to to work we try

1841
01:57:56,230 --> 01:57:59,900
to assess things we genuinely try hand tuning for you know i don't know maybe

1842
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:05,000
about a month and we actually primary motivation was not to show of our approach

1843
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:11,550
is getting work on january the best thing we found was appointed sort of apprenticeship

1844
01:58:11,710 --> 01:58:14,210
learning reinforcement learning how

1845
01:58:17,140 --> 01:58:26,210
they are more

1846
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:29,610
yes that is the

1847
01:58:29,630 --> 01:58:34,910
all the tricks and there's not only stupid tries to maintain balance in the law
