1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
even the consumers are infecting themselves so

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,250
i just want to consider just the there are viewpoints or they have share and

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,630
there you can that your marketing strategies according to them

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,860
so there's some not only speaking their mind but they also because their opinions

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,420
so these blogs are basically informative sources and the track consumers beliefs and opinions

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,590
you can use them

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,090
that their reaction to a launch

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,860
and you can understand the language

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,080
you can track their trends and buzz words

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,440
and you can be segmented based on these things you can find tuning strategies

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,000
block and relations of the leave behind the trails of links

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,900
which are also useful for understanding how information flows through this blog network

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,880
and how opinions are shape how this can influence others

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,560
are other customers consumers

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,500
this also helps in gaining deeper insights

16
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,980
there have been some systems which

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,710
opinion mining and blogs

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,590
so system by a gamut of cardboard

19
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,000
we use the a base classifiers

20
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,650
now manually annotated sentences with positive negative sentiments and the site reads this and i

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,170
presented all the unlabelled is adequately classified

22
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,210
one of the system now it improves the blog retrieval by using opinionated words which

23
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,710
are obtained from wordnet

24
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,610
given a query so they find the

25
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,060
proximity of this crater using the wordnet and then they had to

26
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:49,820
finding the right to retrieve similar sentiment blogs

27
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,770
other well-known opinion mining and sentiment analysis techniques could be

28
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,880
following in a book by not being you

29
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:04,920
what are you basically of blogs has a lot of textual content so you can

30
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,170
board of these textual

31
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,590
analysis text mining techniques

32
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:15,150
from different occasions two plugs

33
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,230
this is often called

34
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,670
which is an open source software which performs

35
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,310
sentiment analysis on text corpus

36
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,390
so it separates the takes into the desert in two phases the first phase it

37
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,520
tries to separate the text into subjective opinions which is fact sentences and when they

38
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,230
get the opinions the

39
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:43,000
seventeen people parts basically the positive or favorable sentiments and the negative and sentiment

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,040
next we want to

41
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,920
influence in blogosphere

42
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:53,440
let's look at some of the interesting applications of data mining influence in the blogosphere

43
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,000
there's a lot of word of mouth advertising in online media

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,210
specially blogosphere

45
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,710
people talk listen and the follow

46
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,310
in such a scenario influential bloggers

47
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,230
could act as market movers

48
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,880
they can also

49
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,580
help in suing

50
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,320
opinions about the government policies environment campaigns

51
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,000
and you can use these influential bloggers the knowledge bases for improving customer support and

52
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,090
as i mentioned earlier in blog mining they

53
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,820
good sources for market research

54
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,770
the force from these influential bloggers gordon

55
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,340
act as representative articles since there are so many sort of traffic coming from blocks

56
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,960
they can also help in advertising

57
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:50,400
we can identify the products which influential bloggers give positive feedback for and please add

58
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,130
of these products

59
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,810
there's a high chance that

60
00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:02,270
years after reading the informative piece by influential bloggers click on these acts

61
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,040
the blog influences basically

62
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:10,020
you can two types one is an influential blog sites within the site network

63
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,340
which is done by some researchers and there is another type of influential documents which

64
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,790
is only on the community of blog so

65
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,270
you can

66
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,940
you can have a lot of fun you can have some influential blog sites but

67
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,870
not all the since not all the blog influential but then those non influential bloggers

68
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,190
thank you mister find some blogger which are influential

69
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,690
so you don't want to start

70
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,690
that's a very good question because

71
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,980
now they part of the talk will present a case study of how to determine

72
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,630
whether a blog influential are we have developed tomatoes and we have gone through the

73
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,130
best through it and did some experiments

74
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,650
and there are so many key findings

75
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:05,080
so as mentioned before there are some key differences between blocks friendship networks which

76
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,000
need some different treatment blocks while finding

77
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,500
influential bloggers as compared to finding influential nodes in friendship network

78
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,110
so only there some that the banking approaches which can be used to find influential

79
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,880
bloggers you do

80
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:28,340
there significant differences pointed out by these works

81
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,790
let's move

82
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,920
the trust issue

83
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,810
open standards and low barriers to publishing have created overwhelming amount of

84
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,150
an activist

85
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,480
so it's getting more difficult for readers to discern whom depressed in some cases

86
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,290
there's all this same to the world wide web case you find authoritative webpages

87
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,270
so blocked those people do

88
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,090
create as well as the content

89
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,920
it comprises the sanctity of the original content

90
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,130
so you don't have no actually which

91
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,480
blog also which blocks a crest

92
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:12,980
there exist some work for social friendship network domains but not many researchers have explored

93
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,960
the blocks area

94
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,860
so there a huge potential for precedent research in blocks

95
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,190
so go through some of the works which

96
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,250
existing in across four blocks

97
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,210
some people have transformed the problem of christian doctrine to the one in social and

98
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,790
social networks

99
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,580
the study of propagation of trust among different blog sites

100
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,130
the mine has undermined sentiment

101
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,130
from the window of words

102
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,270
based on the links so that when the words which are the surrounding buildings they

103
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,060
try to find the sentiments from those words and then they associate

104
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,920
like miss he did this for those

105
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,650
block states

106
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,900
so given this kind of network

107
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,000
existing work like out

108
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,500
propagate the trust between different modes of the blogs

109
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,110
but there are some concerns like

110
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,210
they need the block sites to be linked to get the trust propagation

111
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,690
which is again are

112
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:26,230
not many good in london because people generally don't link that well in blogs

113
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,380
and this is computed between blog sites based on how much one blog agrees or

114
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,360
disagrees with the

115
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,310
OK let's look at some of the works that are done in community extraction

116
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,150
not oxford doesn't have an explicit notion of

117
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,230
i mean it is

118
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,020
except the community blogs

119
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,820
like individual blogs you don't see a lot of interaction you just have one

120
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,690
are blogger who is posting blogs and you see a couple of readers who are

121
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,690
commenting and sometimes you don't even see that

122
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,110
so this is not a notion of communities there so in a community like that

123
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,040
so i'm with corporate research

124
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,180
copper technology of humans in munich

125
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,360
and part of the department of maybe thirty five people

126
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:21,300
working on and learning systems and related issues and i am heading a group of

127
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,750
approximately ten people

128
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,400
focusing on machine learning techniques and

129
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,630
trying to apply them problems in the company

130
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,930
so my talk today is about the usually processes

131
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,470
nonparametric bayesian modelling

132
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,070
and i encourage you to

133
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,750
ask questions

134
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,430
but always look reasons of everything a little bit

135
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,980
so the motivation is the infinite dimensional models have gained

136
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,280
a lot of attention invasion

137
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,180
machine learning recently

138
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,020
the most prominent ones costing processes and usually processes

139
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,090
and today

140
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,850
focuses on the usually processes just briefly want to mention casting processes and the advantages

141
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:17,880
that they offer great flexibility and in many applications allow for more truthful representation of

142
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,820
the problem

143
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,380
trying to sort of

144
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:26,630
so got processes are sort of simpler and maybe some of you

145
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,960
i have heard of them already in the middle of it

146
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,820
got process essentially defines prior

147
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,920
distribution over functions

148
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,490
and which means that the centre of the gaussian process

149
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,790
so back function from x to y is the input space output space you can

150
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,300
write it like this guy got it passes the mean function and you have some

151
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,350
covariance kernel function which specifies the gaussian process

152
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,020
and i was impressed is infinite dimensional generalizations of finite dimensional gaussian distribution

153
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,340
so we simply let the number of dimensions

154
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,060
you can think of course

155
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,380
typical problems we might have samples of the underlying true function

156
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:19,080
and we want to calculate posterior distribution over functions or made make predictions at a

157
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,590
new input

158
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,540
so if you have the exact

159
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,610
measurements of function you might consider this to be constant process smoothing in most applications

160
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,930
you have only

161
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,970
noisy measurements of the function

162
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,120
and then you have to deal with gaussian process regression

163
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,650
so this is all i want to say about casting processes

164
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:47,610
so today it's about the usually processes and a lot of ways is similar to

165
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,170
a lot of other ways have a different but this process defines the pile of

166
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,770
probability distributions over measures

167
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,110
and these are the things which are negative and after to integrate to one in

168
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,240
some sense

169
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,010
before we had a good simply forgot to process was the function now we have

170
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,870
a sample of a dirichlet process is is a distribution and the notation typically they

171
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,750
right speak g let and there are two things you want the base distribution g

172
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,460
not and the concentration parameter alpha not people

173
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,000
learn about all of this later on

174
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,800
in the same sense as in in

175
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:35,220
the process is infinite dimensional usually is a simple generalizations of the final usually distribution

176
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,810
to infinite dimension

177
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,800
and here is a typical example we might have samples of the underlying true distribution

178
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:48,290
and we want to calculate the posterior distribution are calculate the predictive distribution for sample

179
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,180
so so the big difference here is now we don't have sent the function but

180
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,180
we have samples of the distribution of the true underlying distributions

181
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,660
and again we can also consider the case that we don't obtained samples

182
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:10,410
from this distribution but something like noise from this distribution and this will be

183
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,950
the most important case

184
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,640
the most important application of the usually processes in terms of this seriously process mixture

185
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,280
so this is a very short introduction and we now we go into the details

186
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,550
of all of it

187
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:35,440
political so i would start with a brief introduction motivation modelling measure if how many

188
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,190
lectures in summer school have taken station view on things

189
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,270
so get everybody sort of warmed up

190
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:48,320
then i will talk about nineteen almost anything with usually prior to this the finite

191
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,280
dimensional case

192
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,480
and it's very important because it sets up the whole situation for the infinite case

193
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,150
so if you understand this

194
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,010
immediately then the usually process is quite simple

195
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:07,540
otherwise it seems always like all these definitions like chinese restaurant processes stick breaking processes

196
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,600
come out of nowhere what if you sort of see the finite dimensional case infinite

197
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,170
it was discovered is the direct application of one of the terms will be starting

198
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,140
so it's

199
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:26,720
fema as looking or well what can these abstract matrix terms be good for

200
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,510
i was incredible about

201
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,320
OK so an optimum branchings systems

202
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,390
a system of k

203
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,240
branching into an optimum system of k

204
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,200
edge disjoint branchings

205
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,290
each was specified groups

206
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:55,550
which is the cheapest or the most value for doesn't matter we're minimizing and maximizing

207
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,550
of course

208
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:03,470
so that's the optimum branching systems problem and i hope we will get to

209
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,910
seem to have the

210
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,840
matrix theory

211
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,220
and and any and you know the theorem that

212
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:21,030
every point in a polytope is a convex combination of the given finite set

213
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,410
in particular the set of extreme points are vertices of the polytope

214
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,470
the polytope can be defined as the bounded polyhedron that is bounded set described by

215
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,680
a set of linear inequalities

216
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,830
the basic theorem of linear programming is that the same thing as the convex combinations

217
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:46,830
of a finite set and finding that the current theorem says that factor

218
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,100
any points point is an active the a point is an b

219
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,760
it only it's common convex combination of the small number

220
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,260
these extreme points

221
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,760
and p

222
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,140
colin p

223
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,270
let's back

224
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,970
what to predicates that simply states that the variables

225
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:26,650
the inputs to and the statement is called a and b

226
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,770
and whenever it's true

227
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:34,270
there's an easy proof for certification that it's true right

228
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,530
many times today

229
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,720
people have said something is NP hard

230
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,040
and that

231
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,780
if necessary use of the term

232
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,210
tended to give and the bad name you know better at

233
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,720
but NP is a very very positive thing

234
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,110
very positive thing in particular

235
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,510
of course the predators colin colin b

236
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,290
if in a lot the negation is NP

237
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,370
now a theory is called a good characterisation

238
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,180
of that predicate

239
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,020
is about

240
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,470
that predicates

241
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,840
it says how

242
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,210
that predicate is in NP and co and p

243
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,950
and it's a practical conjecture

244
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,800
the predicate is in

245
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,100
and p intersect second peak

246
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,830
then there exists the palatine algorithm for deciding

247
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,510
this is this turned out to be true many many times

248
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:59,340
it it's an includes for recognizing primality

249
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,670
by this time you know

250
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,590
so quite some years ago now are not that many years ago by time frame

251
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,420
there were four

252
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,950
linear programming

253
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,180
almost almost every

254
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:22,210
almost every theorem that has a place to predicates in and the calling the

255
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,040
has in fact turned

256
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,740
a polytime algorithm

257
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,700
now we're going to be speaking today

258
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,880
the important example of that

259
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,220
namely a

260
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,090
submodular minimisation

261
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,960
we will show very easily

262
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:48,220
so we we have an oracle that and as the values at the best

263
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,600
any subset as

264
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,290
or after submodular

265
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,640
we'll see

266
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,600
the characterization

267
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,620
minimality of function

268
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,180
as an example of this

269
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,010
that will be

270
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,140
lp duality theorem

271
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,420
together with

272
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,730
and easy description

273
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,130
right hand side

274
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,880
and the dual LP

275
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,250
four years two

276
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:49,870
classically understanding linear programming only as an explicit list of inequalities and explicitly given

277
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,570
in combinatorial optimisation

278
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,140
if we treat

279
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,470
where this is an

280
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:05,390
exponentially large systems where

281
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,340
each one of each member

282
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,610
it is easy to recognise

283
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,390
each inequality is easy to recognise the standard two

284
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,950
so really here

285
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,720
if we had a better example would be

286
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,220
actually no peace with that that has

287
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:35,490
exponentially large collection here an exponential therefore an exponentially large

288
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,200
collection of

289
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,470
and all variables

290
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,240
but we have an easy description

291
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,000
that enables us with any one of these inequalities and to us

292
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,460
to see yes it is one of the describing the columns

293
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,340
and he had that situation

294
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,540
then the

295
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,210
the minimax theorem

296
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:04,250
applies to these that's potentially large a systems

297
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,700
give you

298
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,590
and p

299
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,400
colin np there

300
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,770
actually two types

301
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,990
the linear programming

302
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,080
it gives you choose

303
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,010
one linear programs

304
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,620
gives you

305
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,900
are linear programming system one inequality system actually gives you two

306
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,470
very disdain

307
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,500
np co NP there

308
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,770
let me see that i had written down here

309
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,370
one problem is

310
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,100
by an article in the system in any colonies

311
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,090
we're given an act

312
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,220
and we want to decide if an axe

313
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:03,340
satisfies all those inequalities

314
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:11,050
then p one and p co NP there is another to good characterization of when

315
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,940
a point x

316
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,060
it satisfies all those inequalities

317
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:22,040
well a are so our predicates

318
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,180
x satisfies all these call

319
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,600
well that's really colin p

320
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,970
because the it

321
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,930
predicate is not true

322
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,340
we can prove that it's not true

323
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,560
but just simply displaying one

324
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,710
of these

325
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,980
and in the

326
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,920
and it applies to

327
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,500
come to that

328
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,990
markets that

329
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,310
in this if we know something about the others if we know that you know

330
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:58,220
the organisms most is more likely to choose such functions over some other functions

331
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,940
we can as well just that in the PS potentials are correspondingly and then get

332
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,730
about that would be better because we would have signed always the functions that are

333
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,180
likely to be picked

334
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,030
and and get an decrease factor

335
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,420
but importantly

336
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,970
this way shorter

337
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,920
it should be picked before seeing the data again i this

338
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,290
in the union bound

339
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,730
that's all that does not depend on the data right up saying the problem

340
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,230
to deterministic wanted so we cannot

341
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,280
change the way because otherwise it would be too easy right we we would say

342
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,810
o we know that the function the younger is an aspect is this one after

343
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:42,590
seeing the data that's what it's all the weight on the function

344
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,180
and then we get rid of this quantity right he was one of one of

345
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,730
our key zero

346
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,900
and then we have the perfect have been found out of

347
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,510
but that's cheating right because we can't really change the weight

348
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,520
as we

349
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,310
once we have seen

350
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,800
OK but that's that's one possible way

351
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,760
these are

352
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,090
again we might

353
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,300
now another way

354
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,750
here's the divine

355
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,150
as we've seen before

356
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,300
what we have seen before

357
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,020
when the notions of small variance we can input about this use this district in

358
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,960
slightly different way

359
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,170
let's look at functions that actually makes similar predictions in class like this

360
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,250
g one to g capital and

361
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,480
there might be functions that actually

362
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,730
always treated the same way or

363
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,210
in a similar way

364
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,730
i mean if you look at the different classifiers using this one and this one

365
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,010
is likely the

366
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,880
maybe the you know them all is making the same predictions so they are thinking

367
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,290
on is the same mistake to some small difference

368
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,510
when comes we exploit this fact right

369
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,550
in particular

370
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,480
this was

371
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,010
i mean if we take such action that are

372
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:05,440
that's close enough then the probability that the different would be small

373
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,080
and we can do this

374
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,190
by refining the union bound

375
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,480
it means that you why

376
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,610
o how

377
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,890
when we look at

378
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,830
the deviation for a given function

379
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,380
we can introduce some other let's say

380
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,320
i have zero

381
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,250
and compare the deviation of this one with the addition of this one

382
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,640
and the difference between those guesses would actually be something that i read in this

383
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,740
like to use the vision that

384
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,270
it means i'm looking at the deviation not of

385
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,190
one function but of the difference between the function

386
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,430
this essentially means n minus zero

387
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,520
minus and plus he as p and

388
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,510
a way to combat the patient i apply this operator the different

389
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:02,150
mister even the functions here as senior

390
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,420
it means that

391
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,430
there there is as i said before is bounded by expectation

392
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:14,550
if they are similar the expectation of the difference will be small

393
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:19,990
so we get smarter

394
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,500
so if i applied this directly

395
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,490
i did that now

396
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,710
the deviation from my initial function

397
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:33,540
is the same as deviation for one expansion zero

398
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,220
that's where i get the normal

399
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,380
and of things

400
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,100
i have some about them but

401
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,610
this is the main major

402
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,150
and then

403
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,050
for this part here

404
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,750
because this part as friends which is bounded by i mean assuming that we have

405
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,730
was this

406
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,440
property here

407
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,090
six structure will give me something which is

408
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,960
where i live by the variance fixing

409
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,570
and i can apply i mean the slogan comes from the fact that you apply

410
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,240
this to all possible functions f in my class

411
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:20,190
assuming that all these functions are at distance as far from the

412
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,250
OK it's a bit confused here

413
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:31,260
OK maybe i should have

414
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,950
picture before

415
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,770
what i'm saying is that let's consider the following cases

416
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,570
we take the function of zero

417
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,470
we consider that our class

418
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,550
p five or g i mean

419
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,740
f and g

420
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,950
i think

421
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:52,100
it assumed that all of my class are a distance

422
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,500
at most alpha

423
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,320
these things being

424
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,810
measured as

425
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,320
the probability that at minus five

426
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,360
different from zero

427
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,410
this is the distance between the function

428
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,660
and we assume that

429
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,160
i mean this is some notion of distance between the function which depends on the

430
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,650
probability distribution of course but we assume that they have to all be closed with

431
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,180
a happen to all

432
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,440
similar error

433
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,190
which of the same

434
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,720
it up to smaller time and then the rest of the stuff here which actually

435
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,090
is relevant because uncorrelated with the previous time

436
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,060
to end up with this kind of structure here

437
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,930
and there are various ways of actually say computing this

438
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,310
the is at time zero

439
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,940
corresponding to matrix equation and then you can actually get the the

440
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,490
covariance it's

441
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,610
time offsets to spike

442
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,670
this exponential factor here

443
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,140
so basically certainly for

444
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,430
this is for the

445
00:27:52,440 --> 00:28:00,930
is it the time invariant linear system we can actually get a solution for the

446
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,490
covariance function

447
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,930
from the line matrix

448
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,860
stochastic differential equations

449
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,580
clearly is a lot more theory here is that one can do we simply use

450
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,790
the spectral techniques which we use the univariate case well and the small stuff in

451
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,840
in gardner's book for example

452
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,170
on that

453
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:27,970
one thing we actually saw when we look to the samples from the

454
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,460
for most process also dam stochastic

455
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,590
so a simple harmonic oscillator is that we actually saw

456
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,080
very different smoothness properties of that first order and second order st

457
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,260
and where this is coming from is basically that

458
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:51,190
stochastic differential equations of order p p minus one times mean square differentiable

459
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,950
the processes correspond to that have this different abilities so

460
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,380
if p is one we get a zero difference because we can to continuity from

461
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:04,950
the diffusion process but not differentiability and this p two we get one

462
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,140
you get one times differentiability

463
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,950
and in easy intuitive way to think about this is to say that

464
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:18,200
because the process gets rougher the more times against differentiated basically the roughest thing here

465
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,700
x if p is of order

466
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,110
white noise which is non differentiable so basically as we look these things up as

467
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,670
we integrated areas

468
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,270
three times we'll see the LC differentiability appear so

469
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:37,400
we can sort of intuitive at understand the the mean square differentiability of the resulting

470
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,200
process through this kind of argument

471
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,000
OK this is

472
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,590
this is an interesting point and i guess it's quite related to things that we

473
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,030
want my i want to talk about today because

474
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,120
it's question about how we actually do discretisation

475
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,700
of continuous time

476
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,130
i guess in markov process

477
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,600
so we have a

478
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,640
in order p stochastic differential equation

479
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,860
the question is really how rule that relate will if we discretize that some some

480
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,370
time interval say some great

481
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,970
is it the case that the

482
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,250
process will have the same markov properties of the underlying process and the answers you

483
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,390
need to be careful

484
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,840
OK so let's define

485
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:34,450
certainly for discrete time we can define all my process so not only the is

486
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,170
a i'm sorry so we have this is usually the

487
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,970
this linear terms we had before

488
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:48,910
autoregressive terms and here rather than just having be zero just driving it with noisy

489
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,320
at the current time

490
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,810
driving the lagged history of of these noises

491
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,460
this is on the process because can also of the continuous time analogues of this

492
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,950
it turns out that kept the power spectrum now has is rational for

493
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,090
i mean it in fact get the order of

494
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,240
two here to be less than european all of this to be well defined

495
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,650
the the key

496
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,020
he theorem here

497
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,630
is that if we take a continuous time

498
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,690
stationary testing process

499
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:26,430
and let x hp discretisation of that process is

500
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:31,710
x is an on process has this kind of power spectral density xh will be

501
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,700
a discrete time process however

502
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,360
if x is an a are process and so in other words the stochastic differential

503
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,540
equations of order p of the kind be talking about then actually when we discretize

504
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,670
it's is not necessarily and they are process actually turned out to be an arm

505
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,310
process so

506
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,750
on is to be a little bit careful about the

507
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,910
going from

508
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,040
a continuous time discrete time because of this

509
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:06,380
OK i also want to say something about inference

510
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,590
of course one thing that we

511
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,950
so want to do more than guessing processes we want to have some we've got

512
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,220
the underlying

513
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:18,640
stochastic differential equations giving rise to guassian process prior over functions we have some observations

514
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,630
of that

515
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:26,080
the process of various times meanwhile want do inference about predicting the values at other

516
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,750
if we doing something like an all-star process than fact

517
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,400
we already have this markov property

518
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,320
which means that

519
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,890
we only need to condition is essentially for making a prediction at some time t

520
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:45,960
star then we've got a whole bunch of observations of various times we actually need

521
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:52,860
only worry about those observations in the part immediate past immediate future that of all

522
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:58,510
that time t star because of the markov property everything else is is independent it

523
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,690
is conditionally independent of the rest of the variables given the past and future

524
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,210
there's a slight caveat here OK which is that if we if we have pure

525
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,870
observations of the process this is true

526
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,870
but if we have observations

527
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,860
which are corrupted by noise than in fact then this markov property breaks and we

528
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,520
actually need to get process prediction we need to actually make use all the observations

529
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,930
at various times

530
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,780
so basically

531
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:30,960
this stuff how to do this prediction is just an example of guassian process prediction

532
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:36,770
so we are interested in this conditional distribution of x fifty star given these these

533
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,660
under the casting process we know it's going to be

534
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,100
it's going to be against prediction was mean and some

535
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:51,200
and the usual casting process prediction equations apply the kind of slightly simplified because in

536
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,290
fact you need to worry about these two observations as in the past and the

537
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,430
future so we can just define this

538
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,670
two by two covariance matrix

539
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,640
well for example case to p is

540
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,620
kft start to be so this is just

541
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,670
TP TP and so on

542
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,180
just do this very simple matrix inversion to get these predictions such

543
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:16,990
at least under the if we can really exploit markov nature

544
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,430
of the ocean and that process for example

545
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,240
to make these

546
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,160
to make predictions are very compact way

547
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:33,250
OK so lose

548
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,470
i talked about the stochastic differential equation view

549
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,950
i've talked about how to work and covariance functions of these processes and try to

550
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,900
understand the covariance functions

551
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:47,070
we also want to talk a bit about fokker planck equations

552
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,180
so basically one thing we could be interested in saying OK i'm at value x

553
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,690
zero time zero

554
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,080
what i want to do

555
00:34:55,110 --> 00:35:00,080
is to understand how much that evolution and where i'm going to be a set

556
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,450
it is denoted by the start

557
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,910
and i show you

558
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,630
it's very simple

559
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,400
that it is the best possible

560
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,520
portfolio of vector

561
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:22,300
the constantly rebalanced portfolio what you can achieve

562
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,070
for the portfolio

563
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,530
that or you can have the the

564
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:34,650
the best possible asymptotic average growth rate

565
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,070
it doesn't automatically is the following as you

566
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,420
that you

567
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,880
work can we need these be star

568
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,570
defined in the previous page

569
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:52,660
and s is the amount of money at the end of the day and very

570
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,410
you use another portfolio

571
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,390
they comp

572
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,760
the amount of

573
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:04,820
money you can't if you convert the average growth rate asymptotic

574
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,800
for an arbitrary portfolio vector b

575
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,790
and the log optimal portfolio that

576
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,150
this statement is that the

577
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:20,160
the asymptotic average growth rate of an arbitrary for an arbitrary portfolio vector b

578
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,290
cannot be larger

579
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,710
then the average growth rate of four

580
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,300
of the log optimal portfolio

581
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,940
you can calculate the

582
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,290
the simple

583
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:42,860
the best possible as input because of the average growth rate for the balanced portfolio

584
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,990
and i i d

585
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,190
market cross

586
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:52,440
and the proof is x three with people

587
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,220
here the average growth rate

588
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,820
at time and

589
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,200
it is the average of flowing

590
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:05,660
and make the break that the

591
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,890
at the

592
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,340
and and doctor throughout the

593
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:18,560
expectation of the log reader

594
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,520
because of

595
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,360
identically distributed function

596
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,870
the average of the red

597
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,420
are identical

598
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:43,260
the blue line is an average of independent zero mean random variable

599
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,560
the blue line

600
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,140
goes to zero

601
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,760
almost surely

602
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:57,160
but the asymptotics of the average growth rate is equal to the expected log return

603
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,300
for a fixed portfolio vector b

604
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,510
you do the same

605
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,400
before the start

606
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,660
the blue average got there almost surely

607
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,480
and you

608
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,700
i have to to call her

609
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,940
i didn't because i read the terms because of the definition of the the star

610
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,360
these acts locally are

611
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,720
is larger than the above below before or any other

612
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,420
a portfolio vector b

613
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,700
and it did the

614
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,550
it's a random variable x of ideas

615
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:41,700
it has the distribution and big but it's

616
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:56,620
this is model of park in gambling the theory of gambling horse racing information theory

617
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,070
and here is the list of of

618
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,830
it all started to look at the problem

619
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,640
if you

620
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,590
it turns out

621
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,630
mathematical finance but then you don't find any being on log optimal portfolio

622
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,550
the only exception is the

623
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:24,060
chapter fifteen in the leuenberger book

624
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:29,300
otherwise you cannot learn on

625
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,110
log optimum portfolio all the standard

626
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:39,780
mathematical finance those book which is the local people money is not one act that

627
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:46,840
you were recognised because mathematical department sort of portsmouth

628
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,360
i don't know

629
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,170
i am fighting but the

630
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,490
two to be and that the that was recognised by the

631
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,520
it it it's a long war

632
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,830
but i don't

633
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:10,490
while i think that

634
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:18,560
it's it's a long story maybe maybe during the barbecue we can talk about

635
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,890
let's look at some

636
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:26,700
very surprising good example

637
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,890
the example all of

638
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:34,150
so as the

639
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,130
the first as

640
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:40,340
the rate

641
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,570
he has value

642
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,070
two or one half

643
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:50,060
which means that if if you invest one dollar either you double

644
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,150
or half your money

645
00:40:53,220 --> 00:41:00,280
this would be the first component the second component will be the guests

646
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:05,270
guess either one or remain got

647
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,410
if you look at this example all

648
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:13,670
that just remembering this additional instances and throwing it into my big picture doing the

649
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,540
same thing for the possible

650
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,170
keep on doing this

651
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:22,910
until all the observations are correctly classified

652
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,370
so at the moment all i've done is i've shown you this algorithm

653
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,270
actually shown you get that it will converge is made for all that we know

654
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,850
i could run this out of might never terminate

655
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:43,940
first look at with what they have done before we prove that will terminate

656
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:48,490
so nothing happens if we just classify things correctly i might as well not have

657
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,620
added that observation

658
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,750
if we

659
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,010
get things wrong then we update by why i time

660
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,950
now the vector of exciting one

661
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:03,710
so basically positively reinforcing all the observations of getting wrongly

662
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,310
the other thing is the weight vector will be linear combination

663
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,880
of observation

664
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,050
the other thing is that the inner product between the weight x

665
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,280
can be written

666
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:17,590
as a linear combination of inner products between

667
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,070
extra index

668
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,600
was constantly

669
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:24,880
now this looks like the most idiotic thing you could potentially right

670
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:28,280
here what perfectly good vector in rn

671
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,640
and now here

672
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,350
and summing over all the areas that i made

673
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,190
all the inner products there

674
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,840
looks like and making a lot more

675
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,580
now if i had just a simple linear function

676
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:46,260
you're absolutely right this will be the most important thing you could do

677
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,850
once we actually go to infinite dimensional spaces where i can not explicitly right out

678
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,990
but just implicit in some hilbert space this will be the way

679
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,600
how to go further

680
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:02,270
so this is just a little bit of a hit

681
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,400
let's have a look at the theoretical analysis

682
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:12,640
but the first useful properties that even while i'm just running the south we already

683
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,240
sorry making predictions might not be terribly good but

684
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,690
i can are used them

685
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,220
the second thing is

686
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,680
i can prove that if

687
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,070
the problem is nicely separable

688
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,220
so in other words if there exist some row in the weight vector w with

689
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,630
unit length

690
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,610
and some threshold be star

691
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,850
such that

692
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,870
this quantity here is always critical than rho

693
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,920
so in other words if i can separate the problem well

694
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:43,840
then i can learn it

695
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:45,880
in no more than

696
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,700
b star squared plus one

697
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:52,330
our squared plus one or overall quest

698
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,190
i need to explain what those very qualities our

699
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,950
the maximal length of my observations

700
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,380
this is the weight of the margin

701
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,030
this has to do with the constant offset

702
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,420
and this is essentially the radius of the

703
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:10,480
this means

704
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,120
if the problem is very well separated in other words if this row is very

705
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:17,430
then it only very few steps

706
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,600
in other words if the problem is easier can learn it correctly

707
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,400
on the other hand if there are three large

708
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,900
it means the problem is really

709
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:30,370
hard to separate i will need many steps

710
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,950
the really causing is

711
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,250
this found

712
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,000
does not in any place

713
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,420
involved dimensionality of the data right

714
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,780
it's completely dimensionality independent all updates are dimensionality in the

715
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:46,450
and this is what we're going to use light and we go to the kernel

716
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,590
let's see how we can improve

717
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,580
so the first thing we do is we just found

718
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:01,590
the increase of the alignment between my current solution WIP i

719
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:02,730
and the optimal

720
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:07,070
a large margin separator this time beast

721
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,360
well how can i do this well

722
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,400
i know that wj plus one bj plus one

723
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:15,070
in approach with the star and the star

724
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,550
four mistakes

725
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,140
it's just

726
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,250
well the original terms

727
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,070
plus y times

728
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,520
x i and y

729
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,560
but this time the stock

730
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,850
that's just my original in the product

731
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,690
by the way that should be an i j

732
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,830
and here

733
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:40,000
i've got an inner product between the traffic sign one w star in peacetime

734
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:45,260
however i know that this quantity here by assumption has to be larger than rhode

735
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,330
so therefore

736
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,010
i know

737
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,590
but this quantity increased by at least wrote

738
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,730
after one update

739
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,950
so therefore i know

740
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,030
that inappropriate WMP

741
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,520
w star movie the star

742
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,350
it is at least j time

743
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:09,760
the alignment increases linearly with the number of errors that i'm going to make

744
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,620
the next thing is

745
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,570
of course i can apply which is why

746
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:21,350
so close parts means i can be found in prob

747
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,060
between w

748
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,020
w star movie the star

749
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,850
or of the of the children

750
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,570
OK so when shear

751
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,300
q a

752
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:43,120
and having a and i could move from here to here

753
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,710
i changed this position now which

754
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:50,810
does not need to read the name in the

755
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,990
it doesn't have an input so here you have the current state of the automaton

756
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,900
here you have to

757
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:05,430
since the two sons the chairman of the current state and here it means that

758
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,620
the automaton

759
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,030
is going to

760
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,500
generate competency QA

761
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:19,980
and then for example q a that's impossible things you can do

762
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,870
but you can also do QA

763
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,160
the station

764
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:33,350
i mean there are many possibilities but it may also use

765
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:36,910
still be based on this

766
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:41,620
originally but i guess that in the next step for example

767
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:46,810
the left something to be the right some be labeled by a

768
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:54,110
so if i managed to make the computational time basically what they have locally

769
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,980
is a transition state q

770
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:04,430
here once it q prime ICQ second here with be

771
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,570
to justify this transition it was because from my reading b i could have

772
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,550
in the original automaton

773
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:26,140
last year i added information about which label it can be a and b here

774
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:30,880
by building such a thing

775
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,120
the white i in which is accepting come in if i manage to build searcher

776
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,840
was have the

777
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,420
regarding the columns and the color

778
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,250
as in the original automaton

779
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,560
i managed to do this it's quite easy and of this

780
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:57,080
input free automata to build a good run

781
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,780
except in one of the

782
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:03,600
original automaton for some input

783
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:06,780
i mean she

784
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:16,110
is around the origin of the automaton and some model

785
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,010
and we have to get that

786
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,010
we have to guess possible label

787
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:27,390
so now that you have about

788
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:34,920
the we can have an intuition of this as just show you one example of

789
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,040
now what i can do is to show you

790
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:54,330
the game that we derive from these automata

791
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:59,100
which is input free

792
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,680
it less cooperative

793
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:07,530
so i mean put my USB stick and now

794
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,260
six along the way

795
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:39,170
so we have this understanding of this input free automata that in order

796
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,590
to find such good

797
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,570
around this input for how to solve it

798
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,050
translating the problem

799
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,710
in two main problem will be the following

800
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,710
it will be simply here

801
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:03,080
here's so maybe assure you first the definition so the game i derived from new

802
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,060
so which is basically transitions

803
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,640
of this kind

804
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,480
so from here

805
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:19,160
from this date it generate this state and this state

806
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:24,570
so what we do is that the position of the the b

807
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:35,240
just of the input tree automata which means one state remember the states

808
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,610
these kind

809
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:41,650
that player

810
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,970
zero chooses metric such positions

811
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:52,750
players player zero he took up he chooses the move which will lead him to

812
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:56,610
another position which is this track particular transition

813
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,750
of the input from

814
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,790
so here is the game

815
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:06,210
we start with this position

816
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,730
also started to be with this

817
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:15,110
ocean player zero has to choose a possible transition in the input

818
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,860
that so there may be things that are that are missing but i mean input

819
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,230
field much

820
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:29,300
and when he has written this can give the two

821
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:31,510
play one

822
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,210
who has to choose in this

823
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,320
particular transition and by

824
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:40,130
players zero

829
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:06,810
you announcements at the beginning today this is for those of you who are new

830
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,330
to the class welcome

831
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:14,850
a couple of administrative things when you join 309 1 regardless of what registration took

832
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:19,970
place outside please check in with my office I want you to check in with

833
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:26,350
either hillary lorry who will assign you to both to a lecture section as a

834
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:32,530
lecturer now was afraid 11 obvious also lecture when he was referred we're trying to

835
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:39,250
level the populations so that the balance the seating capacity and then also likewise with

836
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:44,660
the recitations representations run all day long tuesdays and thursdays earliest 1 is denying the

837
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,720
latest 1 of 4 and again we're trying to balance the

838
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,040
occupancy there so that we have

839
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:53,270
good access to

840
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:59,210
recitation instructor so please don't go squatting we need to know

841
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:03,770
with the populations are on their offices just down the hall here

842
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,020
the union of the 2

843
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:11,820
to 1 the so there's the that light out but maybe by the end of

844
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:16,940
the semester miracle occurs so what you look over here so there's the coordinates in

845
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:21,220
2 0 1 and talk to lorry or to

846
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:26,250
Hillary but they'll be a test on tuesday based on homework 1 10 minutes at

847
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:32,570
the beginning of the recitation you are allowed to use on the test the official

848
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:37,610
version of the periodic table of the elements which was you should have 1 now

849
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:42,090
there is a ship in the cayman way through the of you didn't get a

850
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:47,740
periodic table swing by the Office just down the hall from this lecture theater and

851
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:54,540
you bring periodic table and the table of constance a calculator and something to write

852
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:59,510
for I to show up sit down 1st question as it does anybody have a

853
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:04,540
pen or we may not have that many parents so those for items you do

854
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:09,630
not use a cheat on the weekly tests for the monthly tests not for the

855
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:14,260
week and I that's all my recitation instructors to

856
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:17,570
state office hours a nite too will have office hours

857
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,120
if you want to come and see me

858
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:24,940
Monday 332 30 just down the hall come and see me if you can't come

859
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:30,280
by that our you can send me e-mail and I'll be happy to meet with

860
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,470
you and I most mean that I get to meet a lot of people through

861
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:37,010
the course of teaching and recognize a lot of

862
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:44,410
cancer remember everybody's name but I will recognize you and the same thing with the

863
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:49,600
office hours for the TAC office hours are at time when they will be seated

864
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,380
waiting for visitors that means they will not look at their e-mail they will not

865
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:59,040
take telephone calls they were they'll be sitting there waiting for visitors if you cannot

866
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:06,970
make the office hours again contact recitation structure make other arrangements

867
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:10,350
no I don't hear the question is is there a limit to the kind a

868
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:14,130
calculator I don't even bring mainframe and on truck I don't care

869
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,950
doesn't matter you you

870
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:22,500
the calculator and you know I'm I'm holding on your honor and I'm assuming you

871
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:29,300
haven't loaded the Encyclopedia Britannica into the memory it's a calculator to aid in computational

872
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:38,730
efforts and wealth to have to tell you about the readings the readings allow the

873
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:42,630
readings here's the homework this is what it's based upon and we were neutrinos knows

874
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:46,100
when you go to outside of the class get a copy this by some people

875
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:50,950
ask me if you've bought the earlier version of the text you can find their

876
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:53,000
translations of the earlier

877
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:57,030
version of the text on these questions numbers and if you go to the website

878
00:58:57,030 --> 00:59:02,860
and you look down here faltered old to go to falter motu and those homework

879
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,920
listed bilingually last year a list of them in the review of the many people

880
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,710
that have the 1st

881
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:12,630
edition of the text so that if you if you have the 1st edition of

882
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:17,690
the text go to falter motu and show you the the earlier translations of in

883
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:22,150
preparation for lectures I urge you to do some reading and so up here you

884
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:27,120
look at Lecture Topics as the 2nd buttoned-down and you get to a page looks

885
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:32,510
like this and so for today for example it says classification schemes mandalay of atomic

886
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:39,770
structure reading chapter 1 chapter 2 Appendix A. cover everything in the region and high

887
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:40,920
school anymore

888
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:47,620
you regional here come electronic at some high points things that I find particularly interesting

889
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:51,000
but it's not sort of what he said we're going to read this but then

890
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,820
he didn't talk about it in class when I get

891
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:02,260
now when you start looking for our next week you're going to see and references

892
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:07,320
to chapter which is in the cortex and you also see this ln ln ln

893
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:14,060
archives what these are archive lecture notes that were written by my predecessor professor with

894
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:19,190
and if you go to the park and go back here and you click on

895
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:24,090
archive notes and so forth buttoned-down that'll take into something that looks like this and

896
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:28,000
if you look at archive notes number 1 and this is what you'll see so

897
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:33,630
in some instances these notes are superior to the text there's a reason for 309

898
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,630
1 has a syllabus that is unlike

899
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:42,280
general chemistry taught anywhere else on the planet that's why you pay so much money

900
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,140
economy here campaign where you come here to take something that you can get just

901
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:51,700
anywhere that that's the good news the bad news is there isn't attacks that fits

902
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:56,420
and minus one is greater than zero

903
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:59,150
is heat flow in this way

904
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,900
so these are just

905
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:07,710
pictures that we saw last time

906
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:09,460
and then we had some statements

907
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:13,150
of the second law of thermodynamics that i will rewrite up here but

908
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,520
there are for example clowes gave us the statement that it's impossible for system to

909
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,290
operate in the cycle

910
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:24,020
that takes heat from a cold reservoir transfers it hot reservoir that's act like a

911
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:26,520
refrigerator without in some way

912
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,660
at the same time converting some work into he work as the common to make

913
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:31,590
that happen

914
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,040
we had a similar

915
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,770
calvin about the heat engine that required that some he gets dumped into a cold

916
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:44,170
reservoir in the process of converting the heat from the hot reservoir into work

917
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:47,830
now what i want do

918
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:50,500
is put up a specific example

919
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,150
of the cycle

920
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:54,390
can be undertaken

921
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:57,650
inside here in an engine

922
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:02,320
and we can just calculate from we've already seen for dynamics what happens to the

923
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,020
thermodynamic parameters

924
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:07,960
and and c the results in terms of the parameters including entropy so let's try

925
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,640
the engine

926
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:19,140
i'm going to illustrate his color carlo engine

927
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:23,220
and the cycle is going to

928
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:27,230
it's called cato cycle

929
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:30,090
and it works the following way

930
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:34,780
we're going to do

931
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:37,470
pressure volume work

932
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,190
so this is something that

933
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:43,840
by now you're pretty familiar with

934
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:47,520
so we're going to start one

935
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,920
o to two and this is going to be in

936
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,460
temperature t one

937
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,190
and all the paths you're going to be reversible

938
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:09,710
so that's the first step

939
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:11,480
we're going to have an about

940
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,820
extensive studies of isothermal expansion

941
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:17,960
here comes an eighty batic

942
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:23,390
o point three

943
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:31,570
so this point the temperature will change

944
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:32,880
and we're going to have

945
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:42,540
another isothermal step of compression

946
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:44,960
to some point four

947
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:49,040
so this is an isothermal

948
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:50,070
at some

949
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,110
different temperature t two

950
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,820
the core temperature because this was an expansion we know needed but about expansion the

951
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:59,390
system can call

952
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,210
and now we're going to have another

953
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,900
idiomatic step

954
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:07,600
and a diabetic compression

955
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:14,100
that's it that's going to take it back to our starting point so that are

956
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,830
of course there are lots of ways we could execute the cycle

957
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,610
but this is a simple one in your steps or all

958
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,460
familiar with this point

959
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:25,970
this is the

960
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:32,010
and this is the cycle that undertaker so let's just look step-by-step but what happens

961
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:35,090
going from one to two

962
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:37,900
it's isothermal expansion at t one

963
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:41,330
delta u

964
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:47,230
is q one we'll call it

965
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:51,090
plus w one

966
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:53,100
for the first step

967
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,240
going from

968
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,490
two to three

969
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:58,060
that's an idea about

970
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,240
so q

971
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,970
is equal to zero in that step

972
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,290
delta u

973
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:09,840
is equal to

974
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:14,800
what called w one prime so use w one and w one prime to describe

975
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,070
the work

976
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:18,050
involved the work

977
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,790
during the expansion steps

978
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,460
step three to four

979
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:31,280
isothermal compression

980
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:32,680
delta u is

981
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:34,440
going to be q two

982
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:36,640
plus w two

983
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:38,470
and finally we're going to go

984
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:42,140
back to one close the cycle with another idea that except

985
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:44,320
two is zero

986
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:45,710
delta u

987
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,580
is w two

988
01:05:57,710 --> 01:05:59,410
the total amount of the work

989
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:04,040
that we can get out is just given by the area inside this curve

990
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:17,380
well call capital w

991
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,130
it's just

992
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:24,480
minus the sum of all these things because of course these are just defined as

993
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,740
the work done by the environment to the system

994
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,250
so it's minus

995
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:35,830
w one one w one prime plus w two w two prime

996
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,730
the heat input

997
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:41,950
it's just q one

998
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:49,880
well defined that

999
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:53,280
capital q

1000
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:56,300
and i just want to write those because what i really want to get at

1001
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,420
is what the efficiency of the whole thing

1002
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:03,840
and in practical terms we can define efficiency is the ratio of the heat in

1003
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:08,090
to work out we would like that to be as high as possible

1004
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:27,990
so it just

1005
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:30,130
capital w over

1006
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:33,730
capital q

1007
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,450
which is to say it's

1008
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:36,070
into this

1009
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,360
feature space of the polynomial kernel of degree up to two

1010
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:44,860
and we find that the data sets have the same meaning that feature space

1011
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:46,680
any any guesses

1012
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:48,530
what does that mean

1013
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:51,530
so it means that the datasets

1014
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:54,180
not only have the same empirical means

1015
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,390
but also they have the same empirical moments of all two

1016
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:00,980
because empirical moments just functions of these

1017
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,770
the features of all to

1018
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,310
so that means uh

1019
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:06,570
more generally if we

1020
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:09,060
is a polynomial kernel of degree d e

1021
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:13,910
end map to datasets into this high dimensional feature space

1022
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:17,450
we find that the two data sets have the same means so this is same

1023
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:19,480
first moment in the feature space

1024
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:22,360
it means that in the input space

1025
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:27,090
they have the first that all the first moments after already coincide

1026
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:29,650
so just looking at the mean in feature space

1027
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:34,090
that means a lot more in the input space depending on what kind of kernel which is

1028
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:38,220
and then it turns out that if the kernel is strictly positive definite

1029
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:41,150
remember positive definiteness

1030
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:43,510
and are just write down briefly again

1031
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:45,700
always could see definition again

1032
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,910
so positive definite this meant that

1033
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:03,040
for all

1034
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:05,570
one throw and

1035
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:07,510
the real numbers ant

1036
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:09,290
four x one

1037
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:10,340
x in

1038
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,170
the in all the main

1039
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,690
this inequality is true end

1040
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:16,820
strict positive definiteness

1041
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:18,190
just meant that

1042
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:19,690
if the pairs

1043
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:22,210
if the points are pairwise distinct

1044
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:25,240
and then equality is only true

1045
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:26,660
if the

1046
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,460
all these or zero

1047
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:30,760
so that means strict

1048
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,860
positive definite means

1049
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:37,520
four i j

1050
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,230
with iron

1051
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:41,840
not in

1052
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:45,910
we have x i not equal exchange

1053
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:47,330
and then

1054
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:03,030
that this spector is identically zero all entries are zero

1055
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,570
okay so

1056
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:07,580
it's a slightly stricter conditions

1057
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:12,050
and so it turns out if the kernel is strictly positive definite

1058
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:17,350
that means only coincide or they coincide if and only if

1059
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:20,450
the two datasets identical point by point

1060
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,300
so that's kind of surprising so it means

1061
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:28,460
so we take the datasets we map into the feature space and then we compute

1062
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:32,020
the means in this feature space we throw away all the rest we don't

1063
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:36,550
uh store any of these individual things we just store the mean

1064
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:41,890
but nevertheless the mean remembers all the points that me the mean characterizes the whole dataset

1065
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:47,880
so why is that the case so these sentences so easy to prove

1066
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,050
we can briefly go through the process

1067
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,540
and then we prove something slightly more general

1068
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:56,900
which goes as follows

1069
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,160
so suppose we have these two datasets x and why

1070
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,670
we assume the kernel is strictly positive definite

1071
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:05,580
we assume that

1072
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:07,150
for all i and j

1073
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:12,710
uh all these points x i in this expansion are pairwise disjoint

1074
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:15,240
and likewise in the second expansion

1075
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:20,130
all the way i is why i wages are pairwise disjoint so that's

1076
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,300
well that's a reasonable assumption if they were not we would just

1077
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:26,560
rewrite this expansion by adjusting these coefficients

1078
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,320
so we have to general kernel expansions

1079
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,120
and then the claim is

1080
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:34,500
four some

1081
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:37,290
the set of coefficients

1082
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:41,760
so if for these coefficients from nonzero coefficients

1083
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:46,230
we have this kind of equality of course we should also assume non-zero otherwise

1084
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:49,330
it doesn't make sense so we only take sensible expansions with

1085
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:53,720
we have which have unique points and we'd have answer expansions otherwise we just throw

1086
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,940
out the ones that had a zero

1087
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:59,300
so if we have such inequality we make we can write the same data in

1088
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,640
the reproducing kernel hilbert space in two ways

1089
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:04,940
and then these two sets have to be identical

1090
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:09,350
actually one can also prove that the coefficients that have to be identical but we only worry about sets

1091
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:11,120
so in all cases

1092
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:15,870
because only advise one over and all the bitter taste of one over and

1093
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:21,080
and that's the only case that we want and we would just want to say

1094
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,210
if the means are the same in the two sets of the same

1095
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,630
and we put this slightly more general thing

1096
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:28,540
and don't this photos

1097
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,160
so let's assume without loss of generality

1098
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:37,230
there's one point so is by contradiction so we want to show the two sets of the same

1099
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,450
went approved by contradiction we assume

1100
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,780
they not the same in if two sets are not the same it means there's

1101
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:46,390
one of the two sets contains one element which is not only on the one

1102
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:47,680
at least

1103
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,630
so we assume without loss of generality this element is the one that we call x one

1104
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,140
and we assume x one is not in said why

1105
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,930
so the first thing we're gonna do is we will subtract

1106
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:04,040
the expansion over the why expansion

1107
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:09,860
thing that we had before so we just

1108
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,600
move this to the other side

1109
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:16,790
in addition so then we get a lot some

1110
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:18,520
being a zero

1111
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:23,620
and again we make it a sum over pairwise distinct points so if maybe some

1112
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:27,480
of the points in the set x might be identical points and this is why

1113
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:32,060
if that's the case we just always combine them into one and get an updated coefficient

1114
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,030
so the coefficient could now be different

1115
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:36,400
this coefficient in particular could be zero

1116
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:39,290
so we remember that the coefficients we had before

1117
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:41,030
other than when nonzero

1118
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:46,750
we bring this to the other side and make it again some more unique expansion kernels

1119
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,910
then some other confusion might become zero

1120
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:53,710
however we know at least one other confusions will not become zero

1121
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:57,660
because we have assumed that the point x one doesn't appear in the city why

1122
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:00,250
so the first coefficient will not become zero

1123
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:04,240
so here this is our expansion that we get

1124
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,720
and what we know is that if we

1125
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:10,620
all the things such that the first z here is equal to the next one

1126
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,160
x one is not understand why

1127
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:16,370
then we also know that the first coefficient is equal to a from one

1128
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:17,920
which by assumption is nonzero

1129
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,810
and all the other ones that are real numbers

1130
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:27,820
so we have this expansion which is zero and we know that one of the coefficients is not zero

1131
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:29,620
next we will take the

1132
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,890
dot product in the reproducing kernel hilbert space

1133
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:33,920
of this thing with itself

1134
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:36,800
that gives us this equation here

1135
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:40,860
so what have we used here we have used the fact that

1136
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,750
the kernel is reproducing

1137
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:44,630
if we take the product between

1138
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:46,190
this kernel end

1139
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:47,500
the same kernel again

1140
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:49,080
course now in the second

1141
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:53,820
well do it in this column in this column gives us this kernel here

1142
01:14:53,820 --> 01:15:01,520
mainly two reasons one is it's very useful for modeling because as we already saw

1143
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:07,800
in some examples yesterday many  types of nonlinear convex constraints that you find in

1144
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:14,960
applications can be written in this linear form if you use the correct  cone K

1145
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:19,680
and in practice it turns out that a very small number of types of convex

1146
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:25,300
cones is sufficient to represent most convex constraints that you find in practice and we'll see

1147
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:30,580
a list in a in a minute so and that's very useful for modeling

1148
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:39,730
tools and modeling software because you can develop tools that can take an co

1149
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:45,120
general convex optimization problem written in a natr natural language and then translate it in this

1150
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:49,900
standard form with only a few types of convex cones and then if you have

1151
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:54,720
a solver that efficiently solves these convec problems for a small  set of

1152
01:15:54,780 --> 01:16:03,620
possible convex cones you actually have a very general optimization system so that's one the second

1153
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:11,140
motivation for using this linear format is  that it precisely looks like

1154
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:15,840
a linear programming problem so it's a very convenient  format if you want

1155
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:23,580
to extend  interior point methods or other algorithms from linear programming to convex nonlinear optimization

1156
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:29,160
because it's almost exactly like an LP and so we'll see it's also easy to extend

1157
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:37,200
methods from linear programming to conic optimization so we look at some let's first

1158
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:44,600
look at some of these basic cones that are useful and in practice first one are cones

1159
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:51,120
defined by norms so for example if you take the Euclidean norm and you look

1160
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:56,100
at all the vectors X Y  in R M where Y is a scalar

1161
01:16:56,100 --> 01:17:01,800
X is a vector in R M that satisfy this inequality norm of X stays in Y

1162
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,000
then for a Euclidean norm it looks like this I mean it's called the second-order cone

1163
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:11,720
or sometimes the ice-cream cone so if you Y is on the vertical axis so if

1164
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:16,660
you choose an  specific Y and take the intersection of this cone with a horizontal

1165
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:22,160
plane then that's a disc with radius Y right and then if you increase Y you

1166
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:28,200
get this second order  cone but you could take any cone here also the

1167
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:36,780
infinity norm cone or a  one norm cone and you always get an a  cone if defined like this

1168
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:41,660
so we s later we'll  use this notation for a second order cone in dimension

1169
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:49,380
M with  Q for quadratic so this will be the second order cone in R three so

1170
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:55,100
if you want to you use this  so let's look at the second order

1171
01:17:55,100 --> 01:18:00,440
cone program that we discussed yesterday so have a linear objective and then constraints like

1172
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:06,080
this with the norm of some linear function and a linear function on the right-hand side

1173
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:10,760
so this explains why we call this a second-order cone program so you can interpret

1174
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:16,280
each of these inequalities as a linear inequality with respect to the second order cone

1175
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:21,160
for example if you only had one inequality like this then if you want

1176
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:25,960
to put it in this form A X less than or equal to B and K is the

1177
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:33,320
second-order cone then you would use this matrix A so you take this vector inside

1178
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:40,440
the norm here you append this scalar to it as a  last component and then you interpret

1179
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:46,600
this inequality as saying that that  vector is in the second order cone

1180
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:50,380
so if you write it as A X less than or equal to B then you means that

1181
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:54,840
you use this matrix A this vector B and then the cone as a second-order

1182
01:18:54,840 --> 01:19:01,280
cone if you have multiple constraints like this then you can just define K as the product direct

1183
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:07,690
product of these second-order cones and stack all the data matrices in one matrix A

1184
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:12,980
and one vector B and so that's why we call this a second order cone program you

1185
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:19,970
can interpret as nonlinear scalar inequalities as vector linear vector inequalities respect to an nonpolyhedral

1186
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:28,620
cone  the second important example is the semi-definite cone and because in this lecture

1187
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:34,960
we'll always use a vector notation for the inequalities and for the variables we'll need some

1188
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:41,920
notation to convert matrices to vectors and vise versa so if Y is a symmetric

1189
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:50,820
matrix then I'll use this notation vec of U for the matrix stored as a vector

1190
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:55,060
and how you do that precisely doesn't matter too much here we use the

1191
01:19:55,100 --> 01:20:02,900
under we store the lower triangular part of the matrix Y in packed  storage as a vector and all

1192
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:11,840
the weightings with square root two  are needed or they're not necessarily needed but

1193
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:16,110
if you add if you  weight the of diagonal or of diagonal elements by square root two

1194
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:20,960
then you have a nice property that inner product of these vectorized vectors

1195
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,800
of two matrices stored in this packed vector format gives you the same result as

1196
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:30,960
the standard  trace inner product between the original symmetric matrices so that's the product

1197
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,260
we use inner product we use for symmetric matrices the trace of the

1198
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:41,300
product if you use these introduce these square root two  then the standard inner product

1199
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:45,660
is the same as  just euclidean inner product between these two vectors

1200
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:51,680
and otherwise the inner products would be different and that makes things more complicated but

1201
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:56,760
basically it's the matrix Y stored in packed storage in such a way that the

1202
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:02,180
inner products are preserved and the inverse of this operation I'll denote

1203
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:07,540
by mat of U so if U is a vector then this operation

1204
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:15,320
unpacks the vector and makes it into a matrix so that's just  notation so now I can introduce

1205
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:21,940
s semi-definite cone so the semi-definite cone with this notation will be of order P will

1206
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:28,200
be the cone of semi-definite matrices of that order but in that packed storage  for example

1207
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:33,580
this would be semi-definite cone in R three so the two-dimensional matrices of symmetric

1208
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:41,240
positive semi-definite matrices I stored M S vectors of length three that represent the entries in a

1209
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:46,920
positive semidefinite matrix of orders two an then this cone is a cone of vectors

1210
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:52,740
that represent positive semi-definite matrices right with the weighting again to make sure that the inner products

1211
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:57,120
of  matrices these matrices are the same as in their  products of the vector

1212
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:03,600
so this would be the semi-definite cone in R th three so you see it's

1213
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:11,320
a nonpolyhedral   cone and so this is X Y and Z so with this

1214
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:16,640
notation I can use the semi-definite program that I introduced  yesterday and write it in the standard

1215
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:22,950
same conic inequality form so you have a linear matrix inequality like this with B

1216
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:25,250
funny way social circle

1217
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:32,370
so that sounds good we also know how to compute powers of things relatively quickly

1218
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,990
if you remember how

1219
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:38,510
i need to define for this notion was power notion to make sense i should

1220
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:40,610
say what eight to zero means

1221
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:43,100
and so i need some kind of identity

1222
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:47,610
matrix and for the first year the identity matrix is this one

1223
01:22:53,950 --> 01:22:56,900
right zeros along the diagonal

1224
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,110
and is everywhere else

1225
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,060
OK that's sort of just to match

1226
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:08,350
this definition DHA zero should be zeros on diagonal infinity everywhere else you can check

1227
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:12,630
this is actually named entity if you multiply it with this funny multiplication against any

1228
01:23:12,630 --> 01:23:18,400
the matrix you get the matrix back nothing changes this really is valid identity matrix

1229
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:25,760
i should mention that for ATV and to make sense

1230
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:29,810
you really need that your product operation is

1231
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:36,660
so so should be the and circles make sense

1232
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:40,240
because circle multiplication

1233
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:43,350
is associated with

1234
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:50,750
and you can check that not hard because the administration associative addition is associative and

1235
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:53,060
all sorts of good stuff

1236
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:55,920
and you have some kind of distributivity property

1237
01:23:55,950 --> 01:24:02,770
and world wide and this is in turn because the real numbers with an get

1238
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:03,660
the right

1239
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:04,850
order here

1240
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:10,240
with me and as your addition operation and pluses here

1241
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:13,750
multiplication operation is

1242
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:16,360
a closed semirings

1243
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:18,520
hello everyone i know

1244
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:25,570
powers make sense this is a good rule if you have a closed semiring then

1245
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:29,470
matrix products on that semiring will give you an associative operator in that

1246
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,180
could you can take products

1247
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:35,810
that's just something some formalism

1248
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:36,500
so now

1249
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:40,130
we have some intuition question what's the right algorithm

1250
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,800
there are many possible answers

1251
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:44,260
some of which are right on which

1252
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,050
are not

1253
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:55,410
so we have this connection to matrix products and we have a connection to

1254
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:57,220
major powers

1255
01:24:57,550 --> 01:24:59,810
we algorithms for both

1256
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:03,890
the question is what should we do

1257
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:08,090
so all we need to do now compute a to the past twenty power and

1258
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:09,130
minus one

1259
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:12,910
and minus one is one we get shorter spans assuming we have no negative weight

1260
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:20,310
in fact we can compute larger power than n minus one

1261
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:21,340
once again

1262
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,850
beyond and minus one multiplying by a doesn't change in any more

1263
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:35,820
how should we do it

1264
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:39,330
giving any slices of the stupid answer

1265
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:44,330
you could say well i take a and multiply by a and i multiply by

1266
01:25:44,330 --> 01:25:48,150
a and multiply by an normal boring matrix multiplication

1267
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,350
so i do

1268
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,080
like and minus two

1269
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:56,780
the standard matrix multiplies

1270
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:03,560
so standard multiply costs like and q

1271
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:07,000
and during like and the

1272
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:11,400
so this gives me and to the four thousand feet all shortest path weights and

1273
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,880
the before

1274
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:14,350
and no improvement

1275
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:21,430
so how can i do that

1276
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,920
right natural thing to try

1277
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:29,470
which sadly does not work is to use some cubic matrix multiply

1278
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:34,110
we will also sense get there in the moment with somewhat simpler problem but it's

1279
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:39,400
actually not known how to compute shortest paths using fast matrix multiplication what stresses

1280
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:43,500
good suggestion term

1281
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:49,370
you have to think about why it doesn't work i tell you but it's not

1282
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,650
obvious perfectly reasonable

1283
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:56,750
suggestion in this context doesn't quite work we will will come up in a few

1284
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:02,580
the problem is strassen requires in addition subtraction

1285
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:04,670
and here in addition is medium

1286
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:06,250
and there's no inverse to me

1287
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:09,880
when she take the arguments you can't undo women

1288
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,040
so there is no notion of subtraction so we

1289
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:20,970
from the quadratic forms and functions OK and your name is higher ok so I

1290
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,920
couldn't tell that you what it looked for a moment going well that's a lot

1291
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,810
of numbers is that we were doing

1292
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:33,420
OK so this is how I got to be professor OK so high chance that

1293
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:37,470
you're wrong OK means that a lot of numbers terms that these are all the

1294
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:43,760
right numbers because I want to tell you this 1 2 and 14 are like

1295
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:48,540
one-line proof of this is the the just little things that I wanted you to

1296
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:55,890
OK so it turns out the actual homework is really 370 17 so that these

1297
01:27:55,890 --> 01:28:03,780
should be these combined should take 6 men the others combine them 106 6 hours

1298
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,710
12 hours

1299
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:16,770
lose track after a while so I guess the point yet OK so what does

1300
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:21,200
this mean so let this and many of you downloaded the

1301
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:23,710
lecture notes last night

1302
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:32,750
I menu downloaded the lecture note on Newton's method less units when this morning or

1303
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:41,130
OK so question 70 in the new notes Newton's method says prove Proposition 2 .

1304
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:47,170
1 and the notes and if you look at propositions if you were to look

1305
01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:49,890
at Proposition 2 . 1

1306
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:56,310
depending upon when you downloaded the of the notes

1307
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:58,220
82 has

1308
01:28:58,230 --> 01:29:03,030
says prove the following 2 things are equivalent or prove the following 3 things are

1309
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:05,250
equivalent OK

1310
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:08,830
because I took out the 3rd thing even though it's true

1311
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:13,290
I thought you don't really need to prove OK so that that's what this means

1312
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:16,710
that you should prove that 1 and 2 are equivalent and if you have 3

1313
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:20,430
in your notes you don't have to you don't have to mess with

1314
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,360
all right

1315
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:34,060
and so on and ask you to the 2 of you come right in front

1316
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:35,600
of me and said over there

1317
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,950
alright so I won't talk about Newton's method and let me just ask

1318
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:49,360
anybody who has use Newton's method OK how would you use Newton's method

1319
01:29:49,720 --> 01:30:06,640
the work of the application of the entire classification really means that following OK and

1320
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:09,680
you had your hand if you look at

1321
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:14,840
the units of the network around actually evidence

1322
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:20,270
OK who came up with this and actually I don't even know that I have

1323
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:25,950
added that cannot one-dimensional problems and I think it was

1324
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:30,830
a mathematician and Raphson right around the time of the new new extended to multi

1325
01:30:30,830 --> 01:30:36,330
dimensional problem but we're going to look at it actually in the context of optimisation

1326
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:38,570
OK so

1327
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:41,190
Newton's method is

1328
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:44,550
I just give you have to give you a history because

1329
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:49,820
I started teaching this course for the 1st time in 1985

1330
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:53,400
and no 1986

1331
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:55,870
and Newton's method has changed

1332
01:30:56,140 --> 01:31:04,380
oddly enough since 1986 so it's been 18 years and Newton's method instead of being

1333
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:07,100
actually sort of a method of last resort

1334
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:09,580
because you have to solve

1335
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:19,520
quote large unquote systems of equations 500 by 500 systems of equations now is a

1336
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:25,880
method of primary resort because all you have to do is solved large systems of

1337
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,680
equations like

1338
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:34,200
50 thousand by 50 thousand right so the computational power has changed the role that

1339
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:37,760
Newton's method plays in optimisation

1340
01:31:37,810 --> 01:31:40,610
OK so that's 1 thing and the other is

1341
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:46,570
interior point methods which we will learn about in-depth after the midterm

1342
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:53,030
OK rely on Newton's method interior point methods now are the dominant

1343
01:31:53,190 --> 01:31:57,410
conceptual lands

1344
01:31:57,490 --> 01:32:03,550
In convex optimization and so Newton's method is really important because Newton's method is what

1345
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:09,510
drives your point OK so what is Newton's method so if I have an unconstrained

1346
01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:16,410
problem minimize F of X subject exiting some open set which let's just take that

1347
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:18,010
has to be

1348
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:18,910
right now

1349
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:25,200
I can really think of f of x at a given point X bar

1350
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:26,550
so I have a given

1351
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:34,480
my current period of my algorithms X bar and I'm going to build a Taylor

1352
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,450
they would continue to go

1353
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:38,010
they wouldn't have anything to do

1354
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:41,160
pull on them anymore

1355
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,990
let's look at it

1356
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,090
an object that we're going to rotate

1357
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:50,310
i have a glass two

1358
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:52,950
i want to rotate and in the last two

1359
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,320
i have

1360
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:57,670
a model

1361
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:00,100
glass very small

1362
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:05,080
i you the class two

1363
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:07,340
he was marble

1364
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:11,410
i'm going to rotate it in this direction

1365
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:18,490
there were some angular velocity omega about an axis perpendicular to the black

1366
01:33:18,530 --> 01:33:21,530
so the

1367
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:23,130
the marble here

1368
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,700
as a velocity

1369
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:27,160
like so at this moment in time

1370
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:29,990
but it's a very small class two

1371
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:33,010
and the model is very small

1372
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:33,940
the glass

1373
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:35,990
cannot push on the marble

1374
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:37,750
nor can the glass

1375
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,820
the more

1376
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:42,420
now to model gets desperate because the model

1377
01:33:43,670 --> 01:33:45,810
a centripetal acceleration

1378
01:33:45,810 --> 01:33:47,120
in this direction

1379
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:48,160
in order

1380
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:49,740
to go around like this

1381
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:54,810
but there's nothing to provide that centripetal acceleration

1382
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:56,590
so to marble

1383
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,320
is doing exactly the same that the planets will do

1384
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:00,880
if you take the sun away

1385
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:02,700
the marble continues to go

1386
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:04,670
in the direction that it was going

1387
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,100
so by the time

1388
01:34:06,130 --> 01:34:07,100
that the

1389
01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:09,020
to be here

1390
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:12,550
marble is here

1391
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:16,850
and by the time that the two tube here

1392
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:18,600
marble is there

1393
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,020
the marble finds its way

1394
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:22,230
to the edge

1395
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,670
and and that's of course

1396
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:25,410
the basic idea

1397
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,460
my grandmother had always

1398
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:35,600
he was a great lady he had such a fantastic ideas i remember

1399
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:38,630
when she

1400
01:34:38,690 --> 01:34:39,790
made lattice

1401
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,550
we have no good way of drying the letters

1402
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,640
and i would take the lead

1403
01:34:44,690 --> 01:34:47,060
like this

1404
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,010
paper towels

1405
01:34:49,010 --> 01:34:52,010
she had the method of overall

1406
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:54,530
she took a color

1407
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:56,740
and of course first of all

1408
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:58,020
we would watch the letters

1409
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,670
that goes without saying

1410
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:01,300
i would wash it once

1411
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:06,140
my grandmother would wash it three times but that's what you have grandmothers for

1412
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:08,850
now comes the

1413
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:12,790
let's we've also very fond of spinach

1414
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,600
at some spinach

1415
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,710
we would wash

1416
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,600
o to spinach

1417
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:23,660
then she would take something to cover it up

1418
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:29,100
maybe some surrender something else

1419
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:30,640
well over it

1420
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:34,710
rubber band

1421
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:37,420
to hold it

1422
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:40,820
and now what is going to do which is going to swing around and now

1423
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:43,130
the water is like these

1424
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:47,440
one of the work its way to the edge

1425
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:49,040
but there holds

1426
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,010
so what i will come out

1427
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:53,180
isn't it clever

1428
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:56,400
OK of if your demonstration

1429
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:59,930
you may get

1430
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:03,510
so what are linear connection nodes but i want to show you the basic idea

1431
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:05,450
behind it is very interesting

1432
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:08,230
she would go out to do this outside by the way

1433
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,270
but i have no choice of with here

1434
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:11,640
every go

1435
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:18,810
this is the way

1436
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:25,580
i lost my magnetic

1437
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:29,340
strawberry that's the detailed process so

1438
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:31,840
you end up with

1439
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,540
you end up with drive

1440
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:35,030
and clean

1441
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:36,710
a nice

1442
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,530
let us

1443
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:40,840
this is a to one at work

1444
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:42,840
and this is clearly an early version

1445
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:45,820
the centrifuge

1446
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:49,620
my grandmother's methods very tragically

1447
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:52,010
has been replaced lately

1448
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:53,630
we something that you can buy

1449
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:55,800
crate and barrel

1450
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:58,620
we have it here

1451
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:01,840
it is very boring

1452
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:03,570
it's very decadent

1453
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,260
with saladin here

1454
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:06,280
all you do

1455
01:37:06,290 --> 01:37:07,830
she rotate

1456
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:13,530
it drives a centrifuge this this is actually a high-tech version

1457
01:37:13,570 --> 01:37:15,050
of the much more

1458
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:17,900
sophisticated invention of my grandmother

1459
01:37:19,450 --> 01:37:22,940
and is nowhere nearly as exciting

1460
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,430
the days

1461
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:27,190
of romance i really over

1462
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:29,760
that's the way it goes

1463
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:32,550
i'm not going to make

1464
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:33,990
a connection

1465
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:36,570
between rotation on the one hand

1466
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:38,280
and centripetal

1467
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,600
x a celebration

1468
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:42,650
on the other

1469
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:44,330
i'm going to make

1470
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:47,990
the connection between the centripetal acceleration

1471
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:51,780
receive gravity

1472
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:56,000
and pattern

1473
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:58,630
will be

1474
01:38:03,770 --> 01:38:04,890
we really

1475
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:18,240
find these

1476
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:37,750
i mean you

1477
01:38:58,330 --> 01:39:02,250
so here

1478
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:05,180
i know

1479
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:41,000
these all these

1480
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:58,410
this is a much

1481
01:40:13,190 --> 01:40:29,240
they are

1482
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:31,510
they are

1483
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:03,840
these are

1484
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:24,210
because this

1485
01:41:24,430 --> 01:41:30,180
i i

1486
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:17,810
and we show

1487
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:40,500
they are

1488
01:42:43,770 --> 01:42:52,970
and you your model

1489
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:36,770
all right

1490
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:26,180
the model

1491
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:27,470
once you see that

1492
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:28,370
you can say

1493
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:31,200
this is a class one or class

1494
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:34,930
i give you an example

1495
01:44:34,970 --> 01:44:41,620
so that's what classification or association based contrast patterns

1496
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:46,570
the one that i talked about tom tom mitchell's work when he was at stanford

1497
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:53,540
you know very senior process can and he actually worked on

1498
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:57,810
so for example his interest is that

1499
01:44:57,820 --> 01:45:00,240
you know you look at functional MRI

1500
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:05,750
i'm you collect this stuff and can you recognised by the activation of the brain

1501
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:10,140
what the individual is thinking so so he had a very nice experiment to show

1502
01:45:11,990 --> 01:45:15,410
so what they have done is to collect the data so the short two kinds

1503
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:16,880
of things one is

1504
01:45:16,890 --> 01:45:20,460
building instruments like hammers screwdrivers

1505
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:21,140
you know

1506
01:45:21,970 --> 01:45:25,500
all of these instruments and the other one is just vegetables like you know

1507
01:45:28,410 --> 01:45:29,950
i don't know spinach

1508
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:33,450
commandos and things like that

1509
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:39,170
so why should this patient and look at the brain activation in what part of

1510
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:40,200
your brain

1511
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:41,710
is actually

1512
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:44,210
consuming oxygen base

1513
01:45:44,230 --> 01:45:49,220
so so they do the MRI images and they do the segmentation collected stopped

1514
01:45:49,230 --> 01:45:53,550
and and what they found is that the next time they can tell what this

1515
01:45:53,550 --> 01:45:58,070
user so then then you present the MRI signal

1516
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:01,490
your classifier or machine programming

1517
01:46:01,570 --> 01:46:04,670
and he tells you are dispersed just saw

1518
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:08,330
and the building

1519
01:46:08,370 --> 01:46:11,990
equipment or actually seen vegetable

1520
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:14,700
so so they can actually now tell

1521
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:16,470
people what they were doing

1522
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:20,540
so in fact now we're going to the extent that you know if somebody

1523
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:23,160
you know

1524
01:46:23,230 --> 01:46:26,360
happened and any kind of common situation

1525
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:29,890
basically they can't communicate they can't move in your body

1526
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:31,830
the question is how do we know

1527
01:46:31,860 --> 01:46:32,990
but there

1528
01:46:33,990 --> 01:46:38,570
brain or not is the big question because they can still see some activity in

1529
01:46:38,570 --> 01:46:43,470
the brain but is it cognitive activity and now there would act stretched to do

1530
01:46:43,470 --> 01:46:45,730
that so what they're doing is that

1531
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:49,940
so they make one exception to this individual

1532
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:52,720
if the person is still conscious

1533
01:46:52,850 --> 01:46:54,660
hopefully there

1534
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:57,600
the hearing is still working with the assumption

1535
01:46:57,610 --> 01:46:58,850
so so what they

1536
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:04,160
how this person is that you know how good this patient and television

1537
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:05,460
if you are

1538
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:08,550
you know able to think

1539
01:47:08,620 --> 01:47:10,270
when i tell you

1540
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:12,610
i know

1541
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:14,670
ask your questions

1542
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:17,020
because the person cannot communicate

1543
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:19,800
i just think that you're playing tennis

1544
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:20,900
that's what you do

1545
01:47:20,950 --> 01:47:22,490
when i asked

1546
01:47:22,690 --> 01:47:25,530
if you want to say yes to my question

1547
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:27,870
you you think you're playing tennis

1548
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:29,700
if you want to say no

1549
01:47:29,710 --> 01:47:32,080
sing a song

1550
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:36,750
and as a result what happens in your brain the two parts of the different

1551
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:39,330
parts of the brain gets activated

1552
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:43,640
so now they're asking these questions to these these individuals

1553
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:47,210
and they could see the brain activation you know they can say and as a

1554
01:47:47,210 --> 01:47:50,470
result you can decide whether the person is active

1555
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:53,560
this kind of very scary but so expensive

1556
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:54,770
you know if somebody

1557
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:57,960
had a bad accident and you know properly

1558
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,530
paralysed incontinent speak

1559
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:03,560
then you wanted to know where to turn off the machine

1560
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:05,600
or to keep the lights

1561
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:08,530
lots of press socialized issues

1562
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:11,900
are coming to this place but this is kind of work he is is doing

1563
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:13,490
now so

1564
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:19,450
so his earlier work is on version spaces so basically what you're given you given

1565
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:21,730
positive instances negative instances

1566
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,170
and you want to find

1567
01:48:23,210 --> 01:48:27,910
decision surfaces are binary logical statement that tells you

1568
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,510
if this is true

1569
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:31,170
then it is the class

1570
01:48:31,210 --> 01:48:32,220
if it is

1571
01:48:32,430 --> 01:48:35,260
full sixty miles that's what you want

1572
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:39,950
so he came up these notions of version spaces this tells you

1573
01:48:39,990 --> 01:48:44,130
a kind of disjunction of conjunctions statements

1574
01:48:44,170 --> 01:48:45,430
that counts you

1575
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:46,920
what the places

1576
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:49,030
and the d minus is similarly

1577
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:52,410
the disjunction of conjunctions all

1578
01:48:53,050 --> 01:48:56,770
so typically what it means is that you have a positive instance

1579
01:48:56,780 --> 01:49:02,760
you make more generalizations OK so for example it's a if this is red

1580
01:49:02,770 --> 01:49:05,860
or in another you find are also green is also

1581
01:49:05,890 --> 01:49:11,450
the players or green and you believe that you know more generalizations

1582
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:12,530
but then you say

1583
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:17,160
if something else is negative instance comes

1584
01:49:17,170 --> 01:49:22,980
then you do in conjunction so that means disjunctions to grow by generalisation by giving

1585
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,850
union operator

1586
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:27,350
and conjunction

1587
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:31,450
or you know whenever a negative is is the negative one so when these two

1588
01:49:31,450 --> 01:49:34,770
surfaces meet that means you have perfect learning

1589
01:49:34,790 --> 01:49:38,520
that means you have a complete knowledge of model

1590
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:43,620
but of course you generally don't have complete knowledge so you give two surfaces basically

1591
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:45,490
so this is this is how it's done

1592
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:49,900
but unfortunately there are not very useful for machine learning in the sense that

1593
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:52,440
you know we don't have perfect knowledge

1594
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:55,210
you need some being the probability to

1595
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:58,750
an interesting is that once you put probability into this model

1596
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:04,210
then they become basically contrast patterns

1597
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:08,580
so how we can measure contrast patterns is that

1598
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:10,330
i think in nineteen nine

1599
01:50:10,350 --> 01:50:12,750
the band on

1600
01:50:12,810 --> 01:50:15,960
they came up with this model called search

1601
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:17,390
testing for

1602
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:21,180
understandable consistent contrasts the call

1603
01:50:21,570 --> 01:50:22,950
to call

1604
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:27,600
so basically what they've done is you take a part in x some you know

1605
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,430
i think that there are

1606
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:33,110
there are that are not important at all

1607
01:50:33,150 --> 01:50:35,470
they have such

1608
01:50:36,910 --> 01:50:38,700
and it's not important

1609
01:50:38,730 --> 01:50:44,150
all of the articles from the articles is not important because russians my

1610
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:48,290
native language information in this article

1611
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:50,070
i don't have any sense

1612
01:50:50,810 --> 01:50:53,910
again against them out very is

1613
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:57,710
OK so we have all these problems in the world how we are going to

1614
01:50:57,710 --> 01:50:59,480
solve them in OWL

1615
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:01,150
i search engine

1616
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:04,150
and there are two main approaches

1617
01:51:04,190 --> 01:51:09,890
and you can see this approach in all colours are and open source search engine

1618
01:51:09,890 --> 01:51:11,180
and basically

1619
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:15,160
it depends on how lazy argued during development

1620
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,490
the first approach

1621
01:51:16,570 --> 01:51:17,770
this stuff

1622
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,960
do everything during index

1623
01:51:19,990 --> 01:51:22,500
and much as possible

1624
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,180
so people stopped

1625
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:25,990
we use them all

1626
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,070
norfolk from your point of view steaming

1627
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:34,410
steamer and expand or do something is all operations

1628
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:36,570
this is one

1629
01:51:36,570 --> 01:51:40,450
another approach you can do all this stuff during search

1630
01:51:40,470 --> 01:51:42,160
so you can

1631
01:51:42,170 --> 01:51:46,150
i don't do any more followed during induction

1632
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:49,540
and port all words is

1633
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:52,840
and to ensure that you can try to much more

1634
01:51:52,890 --> 01:51:55,490
and what this approach

1635
01:51:57,200 --> 01:52:01,080
the cleanest of positive and negative

1636
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:04,650
o point attributes and characteristics

1637
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:07,660
therefore i one hundred percent sure

1638
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:10,920
that right solution somewhere in the middle

1639
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:15,380
you need to think what will be slowed during charge and you should do it

1640
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:18,360
in advance and what it can do better in advance

1641
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:23,180
and what you can do but there is actually based on this do this

1642
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:28,830
what what what they're going during indexing but i'm going down

1643
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:31,200
and now we have

1644
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:32,810
the result of

1645
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:36,690
minimisation of all structural features of documents

1646
01:52:38,850 --> 01:52:41,360
to be or not to be

1647
01:52:41,370 --> 01:52:42,930
now by our

1648
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:45,370
sophisticated algorithms river

1649
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:47,000
not lazy

1650
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:54,410
and we decided to implement every now everything that was on previous slide except stop

1651
01:52:55,400 --> 01:53:00,130
removing because otherwise it will be simple and to slide here

1652
01:53:00,150 --> 01:53:02,060
so you have to

1653
01:53:02,070 --> 01:53:06,400
and the attribute the this it was capitalised

1654
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:12,420
it was stopped or you have this flag that stop word position one from body

1655
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:14,650
and from the same document one

1656
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:18,910
then the that it was uppercased against of words

1657
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,650
and then we didn't

1658
01:53:20,650 --> 01:53:27,410
excuse me for this phrase but it is four bays so only one well known

1659
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:32,360
abbreviation but but actually it's funny because i really

1660
01:53:32,410 --> 01:53:33,340
had this

1661
01:53:33,370 --> 01:53:37,140
case in real life when people remove all the

1662
01:53:37,150 --> 01:53:41,200
and for medical collection from any collection of medical documents they were

1663
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:45,500
really surprised that they removed a lot of relevant documents

1664
01:53:47,490 --> 01:53:49,950
i have

1665
01:53:50,010 --> 01:53:51,960
this example of

1666
01:53:53,610 --> 01:53:55,570
abbreviation expansion

1667
01:53:55,590 --> 01:53:58,870
i have this abbreviation for forms

1668
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:04,220
i don't know what i can be computed as the law if you're doing operations

1669
01:54:05,430 --> 01:54:09,690
it's still stop because they use the same flag as for the role

1670
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:15,380
forty additional flags this aberration this thing position because we know that it's in the

1671
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:17,610
same position in the document

1672
01:54:19,230 --> 01:54:24,160
from the same document and the concession for all other work

1673
01:54:24,270 --> 01:54:27,630
if you think that you know where to features

1674
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:29,610
you should extract extracting put them

1675
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:32,500
there is one

1676
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:33,870
pretty popular

1677
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:39,100
very common but popular because of who they are engine

1678
01:54:39,110 --> 01:54:41,930
and and what they're doing the also extracting

1679
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:46,230
the result of all syntactic

1680
01:54:46,290 --> 01:54:51,050
parts of all sentences into these attributes and the index of this

1681
01:54:51,070 --> 01:54:53,210
for example is not

1682
01:54:53,210 --> 01:54:55,500
a little bit of delay here because

1683
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:57,970
some reason the packaging coming out there so

1684
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:03,370
my computer switched off so i'm going to play

1685
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:09,960
i so discovery program it's it's due to come at the beginning of next year

1686
01:55:10,230 --> 01:55:16,140
and it's discovery program called the a bit of political we connections and so basically

1687
01:55:16,140 --> 01:55:19,960
what they do is they basically come up with like the hypothesis all three questions

1688
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:23,570
that the kind one asking episode and i want to go although one in our

1689
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:29,900
thinking this episode one is the ability to recognise faces species specific

1690
01:55:29,910 --> 01:55:33,490
the things they want to collect can monkeys recognise human faces can

1691
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:37,980
humans obviously we can recognise monkey faces and what's aspects that they sort of the

1692
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:42,180
empire we part the impact the kind of basically come going well

1693
01:55:42,190 --> 01:55:47,440
the most species independent thing that you can get the computer callow computers recognise faces

1694
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:51,840
track places and things and so they came to see me only showed them how

1695
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:55,910
the big database that we collected so we have actually a big three d room

1696
01:55:56,230 --> 01:55:57,960
it's pretty cool

1697
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,600
she is messy thing my computer here

1698
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:06,460
pretty cool the three during the civil war the animation so it's very logical virtualized

1699
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:07,630
reality right

1700
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:09,590
and it's got

1701
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:12,010
so essentially gone

1702
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:16,930
cameras from every direction and we're essentially for every every camera about thirty cameras and

1703
01:56:16,930 --> 01:56:24,460
then for every different directions and and then every camera we then have a

1704
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:26,660
for every two cameras we have a single computer

1705
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:30,180
and then we have different lots on the two so then we synchronize it all

1706
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:33,620
up and can this capture that are all at the same time

1707
01:56:36,130 --> 01:56:40,410
see if you can show

1708
01:56:40,770 --> 01:56:48,940
so for instance like this is this is an animation of me

1709
01:56:48,990 --> 01:56:51,270
taking the three this frontal

1710
01:56:51,290 --> 01:56:53,210
taking the in whatever with

1711
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:58,380
over the following eliminations that's all taken in exactly the same time

1712
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:04,460
and so we do that across all the expressions of different poses and across time

1713
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:10,120
so we actually have to be very very large data and school multiply sent its

1714
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:14,060
largest database of its kind in the so that's what we're trying to play model

1715
01:57:14,210 --> 01:57:16,140
so again

1716
01:57:16,150 --> 01:57:20,170
the learning part is important in the computer vision but data that is so important

1717
01:57:20,170 --> 01:57:23,120
for the stuff and things so

1718
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:27,120
and so they go the other way close

1719
01:57:27,150 --> 01:57:28,580
it was

1720
01:57:28,590 --> 01:57:30,890
this is like another one

1721
01:57:30,950 --> 01:57:34,680
so the different poses this is this is this is a snapshot for

1722
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:36,370
the ideal elimination

1723
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:42,840
and so

1724
01:57:42,860 --> 01:57:47,370
any single but we have that sometimes the recorded as well so it's got all

1725
01:57:47,370 --> 01:57:52,530
the state all different plant we do different expressions and across the street hundred thirty

1726
01:57:52,530 --> 01:57:54,120
different subjects

1727
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:55,870
it's quite quite a big data

1728
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:58,330
i think you think

1729
01:57:58,370 --> 01:57:59,500
because it

1730
01:57:59,550 --> 01:58:02,550
in in in in in the hard rock store

1731
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,150
can you copied this

1732
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:05,780
ah just

1733
01:58:06,610 --> 01:58:08,330
so let's start up

1734
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:17,520
sorry for the restart of this

1735
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:20,400
well again

1736
01:58:20,450 --> 01:58:26,550
we actually so temperamental but i've had some things can with my macro with a

1737
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:32,680
for some reason thought about so i sing the praises of maximal tolerance competitive traumatic

1738
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:36,240
but for some reason that on my mac when it gets too bad

1739
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:41,110
it's going really bad about gets about seventy percent battery life whatever it is

1740
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:44,340
doors and so on the guys in the next or going to give me new

1741
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:48,180
battery but didn't have any left for left so are kind of display

1742
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:54,050
every time i use my computer i have to have plug was to stores and

1743
01:58:54,110 --> 01:58:55,930
the the same issues

1744
01:58:55,960 --> 01:59:01,110
there you go to replace a battery fixed

1745
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:04,460
i really

1746
01:59:08,970 --> 01:59:10,230
i've done that already

1747
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:14,110
but it still doesn't so you get doesn't mean that we can talk about one

1748
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:17,710
of the very very

1749
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:20,530
we can we can we can have a mac form after the talk

1750
01:59:20,690 --> 01:59:25,820
so getting into the last talk and you guys will be very patient and i

1751
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:30,420
realize that we've been surfing into all sorts of things today so i'm sure it's

1752
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:32,730
getting kind of tired but

1753
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:38,350
this is essentially says user talk but beginning to realize this works of the economy

1754
01:59:38,420 --> 01:59:39,530
to wrap up

1755
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:43,040
the things especially talking about what's coming in what's going to different rather than kind

1756
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:48,890
of and hopefully have got good intuition of exhaustive search greedy search but you can

1757
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:53,520
kind of see that we stopped off the gradient search part just with essentially PCA

1758
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:56,280
there wasn't any real kind of like machine learning all

1759
01:59:56,310 --> 01:59:59,900
kernel learning going on there being so this is the last kind of mad about

1760
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:02,590
why can't i apply

1761
02:00:02,590 --> 02:00:07,020
and SVM to grant said why can't i apply a out of was and that's

1762
02:00:07,030 --> 02:00:10,390
worked really well for exhaustive search what can i do the same thing for ready

1763
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:13,400
for gradient search

1764
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:16,860
and he is you know what you get out of this is that you can

1765
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:18,710
but they're all

1766
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:21,080
it comes at a cost

1767
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:25,750
so so we can we can skip relevant to this sort of so obviously the

1768
02:00:25,750 --> 02:00:28,470
goal of alignment is defined

1769
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:32,750
you want to find out what between the source image and the template

1770
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:35,980
you the parameterize wall what function

1771
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,460
we want to find p it's all about finding a

1772
02:00:38,570 --> 02:00:40,810
and generally for the generic problem

1773
02:00:41,330 --> 02:00:44,650
we call object recognition whatever we do

1774
02:00:44,700 --> 02:00:46,420
we obviously we

1775
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:49,200
might have a lot of lot images of objects

1776
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:54,520
this object is probably is going to be my training set so can i generalized

1777
02:00:54,710 --> 02:00:58,090
such that i can align this with this with

1778
02:00:58,100 --> 02:01:01,350
a high accuracy

1779
02:01:02,150 --> 02:01:05,140
can i also instead of doing it with rigid shape can i do it with

1780
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:08,030
a large what functions so obviously

1781
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:13,710
exhaustive search can work well with something like this

1782
02:01:13,810 --> 02:01:17,720
so this is the desired outcome should them things of

1783
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:19,880
of what was going on there

1784
02:01:19,910 --> 02:01:23,270
get through to this

1785
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:28,230
the city like when thinking

1786
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:30,850
of what's going on with an active appearance model

1787
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:35,280
it's essentially a can come to think of it as a generative duality

1788
02:01:35,310 --> 02:01:38,360
so you've got a generative model for shape

1789
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:42,310
the linear generative model for shape that we've kind established in it for little thing

1790
02:01:42,310 --> 02:01:48,570
we can learn through PCA can also have the generative linear model for parents we

1791
02:01:48,580 --> 02:01:53,210
got the two together and there's some sort of nonlinear interaction goes on to get

1792
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:55,210
this final installation here

1793
02:01:55,290 --> 02:02:00,250
to come up with something forty we've already established that and they have all different

1794
02:02:00,250 --> 02:02:03,410
names we like the name i am but you can call it

1795
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:06,210
you can call it whatever you like

1796
02:02:06,210 --> 02:02:11,360
what and essentially with this generative duality

1797
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:13,710
is that we have a source image

1798
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:18,640
we instead instead of trying to synthesize something we essentially trying to invert the whole

1799
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:22,730
process and we the whole process so that i can see

1800
02:02:22,730 --> 02:02:24,370
the go lecture 10

1801
02:02:25,060 --> 02:02:30,100
so let me say what lecture 10 is about

1802
02:02:30,150 --> 02:02:33,440
it's gonna bring back it will be entirely about

1803
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:35,820
and what we did before

1804
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:41,160
but is gonna bring back these matrices you remember this was K for in from

1805
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:42,350
the 1st lecture

1806
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:45,280
with 2 all the way along the diagonal

1807
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:52,520
of the 1 with the change at the top of the change that to newer

1808
02:02:53,690 --> 02:02:58,740
and then I don't know if I gave this 1 name this is the 1

1809
02:02:58,740 --> 02:03:01,470
that where the changes down the

1810
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:08,400
and and so it's really just it's very very closely related to this guy

1811
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:15,640
just the changes in the age maybe for hanging because this was that it change

1812
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:20,360
came at the bottom when we had those springs and masses hanging in a in

1813
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:20,960
a line

1814
02:03:21,820 --> 02:03:28,040
where the change came at the top is the top boundary

1815
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:29,920
free so this is

1816
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:33,950
all users of this is

1817
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:44,060
fixed effects fixed at both ends and this 1 is free at the top and

1818
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:50,980
fixed at the bottom and this 1 corresponds to a fixed at the top and

1819
02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:53,590
free at the bottom

1820
02:03:55,370 --> 02:03:56,790
OK so

1821
02:03:56,850 --> 02:04:00,670
1 thing to do

1822
02:04:00,730 --> 02:04:08,400
which we poses an exercise for a problem was to figure out what was going

1823
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:10,510
on with the inverse

1824
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:14,940
these inverses are very pleasant

1825
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:21,080
and we can capture those very quickly and by the way that everything I say

1826
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:25,800
about H is gonna come over immediately from everything we say about the

1827
02:04:25,810 --> 02:04:30,500
so all of those 2 where are really the same job

1828
02:04:30,710 --> 02:04:34,830
but provided that are not so

1829
02:04:36,170 --> 02:04:38,010
approach question

1830
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:44,260
and I it I opened the sort of thing on the web page the question

1831
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:48,260
of finding formula

1832
02:04:48,270 --> 02:04:50,990
for the inverse matrix

1833
02:04:53,660 --> 02:04:57,600
suggested to like take the case that 3 by 3 or the 4 by 4

1834
02:04:58,220 --> 02:04:59,820
cases as examples

1835
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:01,830
and a

1836
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:03,820
here and

1837
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:07,760
let me see what the inverse is to be written down

1838
02:05:07,850 --> 02:05:13,070
I remember the one-fifth and so what is the 5 represent their

1839
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:19,100
In an inverse 0 was dividing by

1840
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:23,670
determined and the determinant of the 4 by 4 matrix is 5

1841
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:29,340
and in general the determinant of the n by n matrix is n + 1

1842
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:34,110
so that part of the pattern we could spot but this was maybe not well

1843
02:05:34,170 --> 02:05:38,440
this looks pretty clear along the top of the world

1844
02:05:38,450 --> 02:05:43,070
and follow me and the role

1845
02:05:43,110 --> 02:05:50,230
because turning it upside-down isn't changing anything here where returning this 1 upside down converge

1846
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:55,010
to that and turning that website down convert this way but now the number that

1847
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:56,790
came in here were not so

1848
02:05:56,950 --> 02:05:57,830
but you

1849
02:05:59,850 --> 02:06:02,830
the pattern there was to be discovered

1850
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:07,730
a core against

1851
02:06:07,820 --> 02:06:11,770
Dataset someone approaches and verified

1852
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:15,730
and several other people didn't quite successfully

1853
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:18,340
made made made a good guess

1854
02:06:19,540 --> 02:06:22,010
or they may have been

1855
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:29,270
reach their allowed by this is some systematic I shouldn't say they because it made

1856
02:06:29,270 --> 02:06:32,730
out of it may have been done differently but
