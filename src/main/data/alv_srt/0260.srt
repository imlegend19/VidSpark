1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
so the cooperation requires summing over x or conditioning on the observed value of x

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,070
xi if excise and evidence note and remember that those two operations can be made

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,070
formerly the same by this book keeping track

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,070
so something that x y is going to leave function

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,650
which depends only on the parents of exile on the in general the neighbors of

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,650
x i

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,470
and so they the neighbors will become connected because there is now a function sitting

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:36,000
in equation which has both of those things as arguments and therefore

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,350
in the factorizations sense are connected in the in the ground

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:46,960
so this original graph which is augmented by the edges that we ever added

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,710
is called a triangulated graph just as a reminder

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,310
triangulation is just a sort of definition from from graph theory it means that every

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,230
of length greater than three

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,130
has a clear which breaks the which breaks the cycle

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,000
so in terms of the picture i think i have a picture here

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,310
so imagine we take six no graphical model

17
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,370
and now what we're going to to do is is we're going to try to

18
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,360
eliminate these nodes one by one so the first thing want to do is eliminate

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,920
node x x we're going to try and some out the distribution and x xx

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,830
is connected to x two and x five so obligated to introduce this edge here

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,190
between x two and x five

22
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,900
and we can some x xx and move from the model k

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,310
and then the next one some is x five

24
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,940
and so we have to connect x two and x three here

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,940
and then we can semantics five now we can semantics for

26
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,670
and then we can some x three here x one and x two already connected

27
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,750
and then we semantics two and we get x one which is what we wanted

28
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,880
to get the answer for now

29
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,790
this graphical picture corresponds exactly to the algebraic operations we were doing before

30
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,290
so when we say that x x what we're left with is some function

31
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,730
which has as its arguments x two and x three

32
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,150
sorry x two and x five and function

33
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,560
is recorded for us by the edge in the graph so you can see that

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,020
everything that don't know the graph here has correspondence in the summations

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,500
and this is just the

36
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,900
point that i made here which is that if you take the union of the

37
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,500
edges that got added during elimination step the resulting graph is a a is the

38
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,020
triangulated graph

39
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,650
and that's true

40
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,290
for any elimination ordering now

41
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,880
there's good news and bad news as always

42
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,920
the good news is that if you have a graph is trying

43
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,540
as this graph is

44
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,440
you can apply to very general inference algorithm called the junction tree algorithm and was

45
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,560
sort inference in this graph

46
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,000
the bad news is that it's very hard

47
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,090
to triangulate graph in which induces a small clique size

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,310
remember that we realised that the very beginning and we started looking graphical models that

49
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:28,250
the size of the graphical model representation of the joint distribution depends on the maximal

50
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,130
clique size is exponential in the maximum clique size which is much better than the

51
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,190
exponential in the entire number variables but if you screw up and you think about

52
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:44,340
elimination ordering triangulate the graph yes but will triangular with a huge interior clique size

53
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,940
and you really get killed at inference time and the problem of finding a triangulation

54
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,310
of a graph which induces the smallest possible clique size is hard

55
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,650
in very

56
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,150
formal sense so the the best you can hope to do is to have some

57
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,610
heuristics to do that

58
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,750
so that was just too

59
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,560
but and they save

60
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,850
and the median family has zero star was pretty shocking

61
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,920
so the idea

62
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,560
that i'm trying to find somebody to to

63
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,230
work with the registered myself on implementing this

64
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,980
the idea is that people would set their own yearly savings goal

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,370
and they would make weekly deposits towards the same goal

66
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,710
and every week that on or about the target they participate in the lottery

67
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,580
and this displays of hyperbolic time discounting is people

68
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,440
immediate reinforcement plays on

69
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,830
some players and some other psychological effects and i am worried that time here but

70
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,370
it plays a bunch of different psychological effects

71
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,670
last slide

72
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,460
so in my opinion

73
00:04:51,460 --> 00:05:00,520
public policy not not neuroeconomics but public policy is the most important application

74
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,390
to to me this i realize this egocentric because i do it but it seemed

75
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:10,080
to me it's the most interesting application of behavioral economics right now

76
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,290
i think i try to persuade you that it's possible to design a light paternalistic

77
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,310
policies that help people

78
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,810
without reducing their autonomy

79
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,870
many of the most successful

80
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:31,480
interventions use the same biases that typically hurt people to instead to help them

81
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:48,690
i are

82
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,850
although i have a question for the

83
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,060
i'm going to

84
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,170
that was

85
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,690
there seems to be taken into account

86
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,170
the fact

87
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,080
it is

88
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,040
not be

89
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,670
i have

90
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,120
it's all right

91
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,710
one thing

92
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,480
well to be honest

93
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,480
hundred four

94
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,690
the negative class on earth

95
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,980
so that's the big difference

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,830
you would never

97
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,830
it seems to be talking about different incentive schemes talk

98
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,790
we would need to

99
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,500
in all these incentive schemes are people want to

100
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,020
we generally people

101
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,620
it is very fast

102
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,370
i believe that they should be taking their work

103
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,730
we want to lose weight

104
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,520
and can do it

105
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,210
and we're trying to help

106
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,540
to me it seems quite different

107
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,080
it is

108
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,270
this nation

109
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:59,710
one idea i am very worried worry about

110
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,120
whether people

111
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,250
stop stop until they were

112
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:11,000
i mean i think that people it's hard to imagine people's intrinsic motivation

113
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,830
the sides and this is

114
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,960
in order to be able to

115
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,960
but i think that is

116
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,540
on the other

117
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,520
i think one of the literature on

118
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,910
how do you in principle this is pretty

119
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,750
not notable prize for research by psychologists is pretty simple

120
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,250
only only

121
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,250
so let's take a child for example

122
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,100
so what you pay your child

123
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,580
to do homework or something like that

124
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,960
first suppose that we

125
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,770
or if they were paid

126
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,710
so what to do or a

127
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,230
and i will always lose interest

128
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,390
if you have

129
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,410
well just

130
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,000
all to begin with

131
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,500
and maybe they you get the pattern

132
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,580
so one of the things that could happen to you

133
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,350
even if you withdraw to make

134
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,870
i intend to do it

135
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,310
and one of the things that we're looking at all studies is we're following people

136
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,100
have started to work on to see what happens

137
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:33,120
my guess what we have data like they actually do better

138
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,080
people who

139
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,560
but the story

140
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,790
the first so it's interesting

141
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,410
so i just

142
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,350
this is

143
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,390
so that

144
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,310
so what there

145
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,060
what makes

146
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,560
we actually

147
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,020
for many patients

148
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,020
we want to see how well they were here before

149
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,540
they start to out tour program so we gave them the many monitoring

150
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,000
months before

151
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,310
we start getting things

152
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,250
and we

153
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,670
and i want to give you you some ideas

154
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,500
it doesn't our initial data

155
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:59,040
i suggest that the model just a reminder isn't in this model first sentence seems

156
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,870
to work

157
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:11,710
i this

158
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,460
for reasons that neon

159
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,450
has ten electron so you have

160
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,370
many more bits

161
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,850
many more ways that

162
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,720
electrons can

163
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:26,090
play musical chairs

164
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,500
a lot of lines in the red i'm not blocking your hope

165
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,470
a lot of lines in the red

166
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,840
and some beautiful lines in the yellow i see some in the green i don't

167
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,690
see much in the blue and a little bit in the blue

168
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,600
but the key thing is i wanted to see these lines

169
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,320
i discrete is not

170
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,430
just any

171
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,560
wavelength that can be generated is only allowed

172
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,830
with its

173
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,040
musical game

174
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,420
when the

175
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,620
from one orbit to another

176
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:09,280
and that gives you this unique discrete spectrum

177
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,700
now these flies back to well known long before before came with his daring ideas

178
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,300
but before quantum mechanics these lines were great mystery

179
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,330
they no longer i

180
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,600
i suggest you

181
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,960
use this grading

182
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,610
use it when you outside nights look at some street lights

183
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,850
particularly sodium lamps and

184
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,590
mercury lamps and of course the neon lamps

185
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,920
a quite spectacular keep in mind

186
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,000
will not very nice straight lines on this you light source itself

187
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,500
it's very nice straight narrow

188
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,310
light source

189
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,780
according to mechanic talker be clean

190
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,170
in the twenties

191
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,000
and it would be impossible for me be available

192
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,060
amount of time to do justice to all the basic

193
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,360
i will discuss some consequences that i rather not

194
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,100
prior to quantum mechanics there was a long-standing battle between physicists

195
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,620
whether the light consists of particles

196
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,580
whether they're waves

197
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,810
i believed strongly

198
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,140
if particles

199
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,370
and the dutchman organs

200
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,510
i believe that they will waves

201
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,780
and it seemed like in eighteen o one the conclusive experiment was done

202
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,930
by young

203
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,290
which demonstrated unambiguously

204
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,590
the light

205
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,080
what waves

206
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,690
organs was right

207
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,640
but as time went on

208
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,140
this concert was growing

209
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,540
as there will also experiments that showed rather conclusively

210
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,430
that light really was particles

211
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,770
and it was one of the great victories of quantum mechanics

212
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,680
that it showed that light is both

213
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,760
they behave like waves

214
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:02,610
other times it behaves like particles it all depends on how you do your experiment

215
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,560
in nineteen twenty three

216
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,970
the broccoli

217
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,830
i made the daring suggestion

218
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,020
that's a particle

219
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,680
can behave like waves

220
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,540
and he specified was very specific

221
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,370
but the wavelength

222
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,010
now it is called the broader wavelength

223
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,330
h mark strong's constant

224
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,820
divided by the momentum of the particle

225
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,310
moment is the mass of the particles

226
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,900
the velocity as we have seen

227
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,260
in a to one

228
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,950
if the momentum is higher

229
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,080
the wavelength is short

230
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,850
very high momentum was ridiculously low

231
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,350
short wavelengths

232
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,550
and one of the startling consequences is that

233
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:58,500
protons and electrons which everyone at that time considered particles

234
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,580
can also be considered

235
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,830
has been waves

236
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,160
in nineteen twenty six

237
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:08,160
the austrian physicist schrodinger drove the nail in the coffin

238
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,230
which is famous equation schrodinger's equation it's called now

239
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,720
which is the ground field of quantum mechanics

240
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,590
and it unifies the wave particle

241
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,900
character of

242
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,070
returning to my baseball

243
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,400
they come as baseball

244
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,180
of say half a kilogram

245
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,320
and given the speed of hundred miles per hour

246
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,060
the wavelength that you would find

247
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,590
according to quantum mechanics

248
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,490
that wavelength is so

249
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,310
absurdly small

250
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,670
it is twenty orders of magnitude smaller than the radius of an electron

251
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,180
so it is completely meaningless

252
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:53,220
quantum mechanics plays no role in our macroscopic world of pots and pans

253
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,220
and baseballs

254
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,420
now take an electron

255
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,220
you take the mass of the electron ten to the minus thirty kilograms you give

256
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,360
the electron speed of a thousand meters per second

257
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,080
now you get away flange which is comparable

258
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,400
to the wavelength

259
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,590
of visible

260
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,580
white red light now

261
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,500
something that becomes very meaningful something that can

262
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,200
now you may argue

263
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,940
she will differences may who cares

264
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,440
something is the wave whether something is part of

265
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,330
it makes a huge difference

266
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,390
because when

267
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,270
and they have valleys

268
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,380
so if you take two sources of waves

269
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,610
you want to waste two sources

270
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,800
tapping up and down in the water or you can take

271
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,550
two sound sources

272
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,500
there are certain locations on the surface of the water

273
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,500
where the crest of one way

274
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,470
right at the same time

275
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,020
as the family of the other

276
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,880
so they cancel each other out

277
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,090
there's nothing there's no motion of the war

278
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,990
we call that

279
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,340
because there are other places where it is constructive interference where they support each other

280
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,340
now if

281
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,380
particles can do that too

282
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,750
it is very hard to imagine how can one particle

283
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,220
with the nanoparticles

284
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,820
and finish the two particles no longer exists

285
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,970
learning by learning via trial and error in prediction errors

286
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,970
these stored q values in the q values are

287
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,270
prediction for future for some of future rewards right

288
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,510
now in this case because we already have

289
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,470
q values choosing actions is really easy to have to compute anything you don't have

290
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,300
to solve the dynamic programming problem you're at state zero you look at the two

291
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,680
q values and you see that left is better done

292
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,300
so this is the kind of quick reflexive behavior that we could imagine from individual

293
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,600
one thing is you need a lot of experience to learn you need to go

294
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,390
through this many many times to get the correct q values

295
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,640
the second thing is this will be inflexible right if i now change the value

296
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,760
of the cheese to zero

297
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,850
it's not immediately clear which q value should change without experiencing this made again and

298
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:21,690
and having prediction errors update these values

299
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,250
so the idea was

300
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,970
that goal directed behavior is actually

301
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,980
model based reinforcement learning where

302
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,140
the four where the rat learns the model of the world and plans in it

303
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,310
and that's why we see

304
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,710
evaluation sensitivity

305
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,720
mitchell behaviour is model free reinforcement learning

306
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,020
in the brain

307
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,560
but now the question but now this answer raises two

308
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,800
new questions because we're still stuck with the question of

309
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,840
why the hell should the brain use two different strategies in parallel

310
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,590
why not just use the best of the two

311
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,400
and use that one always

312
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,030
and if you do decide to use two now what do you do if you

313
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,170
have two parallel systems telling you what to do and they say that if they

314
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:17,680
say different things so one system is so i press left another saying no don't

315
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,800
press whatever

316
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,340
now there's a new control problem of like which controller to listen to

317
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,220
new decision making problems are

318
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,640
and so and here

319
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,920
it was

320
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,010
that one way to think about this is to look at the pros and cons

321
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,810
of each of the of model based in model free

322
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,600
reinforcement learning so

323
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,890
each of these two systems is best in different situations what you really want from

324
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,320
a robust

325
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,180
smart complex brain is that would be able to use

326
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,010
each system in the place where it's most

327
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,730
so for instance

328
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,600
if you have very limited training model based learning is actually does better with with

329
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,460
little data compared to model free learning because model free learning bootstraps and uses you

330
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,710
know it's

331
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,590
it uses its own john to learn basically and bootstrapping so it it takes a

332
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,940
lot of time to take that chuck out well

333
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,640
o model based learning put each piece of information in the right place does better

334
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,440
limited training

335
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,500
on the other hand model based reinforcement learning

336
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,970
will do better when it's close to the reward so this tree are the dynamic

337
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:37,340
programming problem is much easier to solve than when you're playing the game of chess

338
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,930
and have to you know

339
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,430
some of the tree of all the possible actions until the end of the game

340
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:47,390
so in the case where close to the reward or have limited training the brain

341
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,270
would do wisely to use goal directed

342
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,880
two years ago directed is model based

343
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,140
forward search mechanism and the opposite after a lot of experience when the reward is

344
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:03,060
really far away it would be better to use a caching q learning

345
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,860
model three

346
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,060
or starts to model free

347
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,850
so that's the answer for why have two systems

348
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,050
and now if those two system this this as a kind of says in one

349
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,480
situation use one system and other used other but you have to have these two

350
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,840
systems learning all the time you don't want to waste experience and teach only this

351
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,430
system with some of the trials in the system with others

352
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,130
so that learning should happen in both in parallel

353
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,320
then if you ask yourself

354
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,920
they have two systems have already learned

355
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,960
rather than decide which one to use apriori by the constraints of the problem i

356
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,980
can basically ask each of them

357
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,760
to tell me based on everything they've learned so far what do they suggest that

358
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,900
i do

359
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,180
but as them to not only say what they suggest but how confident are they

360
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,790
in this suggestion

361
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,210
and trust the one that's most confident in you would help that

362
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,150
this one would be more confident only after a lot of experience and this will

363
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,510
be on more confident only when it's close to the

364
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,510
so the idea is

365
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,520
okay welcome everyone thank you very much

366
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,520
coming to

367
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,720
this we first lecture

368
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,110
of course

369
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,360
information theory pattern recognition

370
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,940
hand neural networks

371
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,870
this first lecture is an introduction to information theory

372
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:39,120
information theory was invented by claude shannon to solve communication problems

373
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,650
the fundamental problem

374
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,320
that Shanne defined was the task if reliable communication

375
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,530
over an unreliable channel

376
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,980
so that's a fundamental problem

377
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,960
and all give some examples

378
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,280
right now

379
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,020
so some examples the channels

380
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,350
one channel way using right now is

381
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:32,490
the channel

382
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
that goes from my voice

383
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,690
and the medium is

384
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,330
another channel that we may be using is channel goes from our eyes up to

385
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,530
the bits about nervous system

386
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,330
and then medium is the bags and cytoplasm and local employment impulses

387
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,890
another example the channel the world carrying around a this is the and i got

388
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,770
ten to thirteen copies of our genome on board in

389
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,920
each ten to the thirteenth cells

390
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,910
hand every time and cells

391
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:12,530
we spend

392
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,070
two copies of the genome into

393
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,160
cells are repeat about forty times and you've gone from the egg

394
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,490
to a human being

395
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,090
hand maybe on the next generation

396
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,190
another example is three

397
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,720
spacecraft saving mars rover or something like that you have

398
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:32,950
an antenna

399
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,880
on earth

400
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,930
and we use the vacuum

401
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,100
transmission medium

402
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,900
then signals

403
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,750
the mars rover and make it content and sends back

404
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,090
signals so is a channel

405
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,070
and it can go in both directions

406
00:24:54,810 --> 00:25:00,390
anne d another example it is i phone line so you may be have

407
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,030
copper wire

408
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,720
if you are old fashioned

409
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,590
connecting one phone

410
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,790
another and

411
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,450
another example is the disk-drive so the medium is some sort of that still

412
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,230
in a standard

413
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,360
hard drive

414
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,580
hand in this drive

415
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,080
use store a message which might be

416
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,680
the file

417
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,120
anduse and that

418
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,520
to yourself

419
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,060
at another time

420
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,090
many these channels go from one place to another place

421
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,750
one place to another place but you can have channels go from one place that

422
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,130
strive to the same place but at a later time and we're still trying to

423
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,170
the message from one location

424
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,620
to another location

425
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,070
all these channels have

426
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,960
in common the property

427
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,900
that's the received signal isn't identical to the transmitted

428
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,120
because the noise or are

429
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,000
other processes are received signal

430
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,400
is maybe

431
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,640
approximately equal to

432
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,300
the transmitted signal

433
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,690
but we've got some noise

434
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,320
added as well

435
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,610
maybe you know some of these channels

436
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,560
maybe there's no relationship

437
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,040
no simple equality relationship at all you just have the transmitted

438
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:48,510
the received signal depending on the transmitted signal in some way but for toy channel

439
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,940
we might say let's assume the received signal signal differs by

440
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,500
adding some sort of nice

441
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,330
hand in most these applications

442
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,990
you might say that's bad news because we would really like reliable communication we would

443
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,440
like to be able to deduce

444
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,220
at the receiver precisely what he

445
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,200
original transmitted signal was

446
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,610
we would like

447
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,640
have communication systems

448
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,350
received message

449
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,420
is equal pay

450
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,860
the original transmitted message

451
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,420
would make far better phone call

452
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,260
about disk-drive

453
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,780
communication between lecturer

454
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,400
an audience

455
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,390
so imagine that's

456
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:58,710
we're trying to achieve this goal we're trying to make a reliable communication system what

457
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,630
sort of approaches could we go for what solutions our

458
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,070
while we can perhaps categorize

459
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,080
solutions to this goal

460
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,500
in two ways

461
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,650
e there their physical solutions

462
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,510
where you throw away and allows you describe and replace it by a better one that's more expensive maybe

463
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,210
you take your copper wires and you put better insulation on them

464
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,710
new users

465
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:36,440
cold a magnetic field you add cooling so change the physics to reduce the noise

466
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,160
so this physical solutions

467
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,600
we could talk about system solutions

468
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,590
and the idea of system solution is we accept the lousy channel has it is and we had

469
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,090
applies only

470
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,260
because is the only

471
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,030
and here

472
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,280
those people

473
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,860
well the results of applying them

474
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,380
well the result

475
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,530
for example i just want to get the two

476
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,380
so when i like that

477
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,690
and here is the outline

478
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,780
if you put down here

479
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,740
and they may be the case this big so we use them was what they

480
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,300
were no longer

481
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,070
so if you actually check only

482
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,940
my four

483
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,360
others because we can't apply

484
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,110
now what

485
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,820
otherwise we will have

486
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,940
one like the

487
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,090
these people large

488
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,360
the ball

489
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,400
they are about

490
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,340
in the segmentation

491
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:03,880
you you disagree

492
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,760
some of the

493
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,110
in which

494
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:18,900
like this the walls which are the images what

495
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,280
they like it just put it all the way to image

496
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,860
because the bombers

497
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,800
much more

498
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,050
i agree

499
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,760
or the be

500
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:43,210
problem when have more than one in which he would have a lot of money

501
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,490
laundering in my

502
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,920
page twenty one that will be a lot of

503
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,150
what we can do

504
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,650
we can use the call the mach

505
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,460
what matters

506
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,960
we also that

507
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:30,030
and is always a

508
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,940
two percent

509
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,760
what can we can

510
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,990
i can be in turn things

511
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:45,440
with that in mind

512
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,800
i mean

513
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,210
and one

514
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,360
one of the not very good at all

515
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,190
because the

516
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:04,590
great light weight

517
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,150
and that there

518
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:10,010
all were

519
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:12,070
and that's

520
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,780
a money

521
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,510
in march

522
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,690
the image

523
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,590
and then we can say

524
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,300
so we're not allowed

525
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,570
you don't have

526
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,840
that is

527
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,860
how much more

528
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,110
between these two

529
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,590
which one of the body

530
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,190
can be also

531
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,110
vector by applied

532
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,670
thank you chris

533
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,690
so process

534
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,550
we yes

535
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,170
we can have

536
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,860
one of the first

537
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,610
from which

538
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,690
you feel like

539
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,990
on the one local

540
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,380
the model

541
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,240
and the rest of the page

542
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,460
and that is

543
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,880
of segmentation which

544
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,740
will be like

545
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,190
and the

546
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,240
the lake

547
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,710
thank you

548
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,780
o thing the page

549
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,280
so about the limitations

550
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:49,380
so that's where i'm going

551
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,150
what we need

552
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,240
to my

553
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,990
what which can be be

554
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,860
so there is

555
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,780
the long range

556
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,280
the that by the way

557
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,960
so again

558
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,840
i think that

559
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,720
which of the two

560
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,300
and the

561
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,800
you can

562
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,320
one particular

563
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,690
and for

564
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:30,760
the area around the world

565
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,090
one one

566
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,360
the the fraction of original surface

567
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,510
features of

568
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,920
the point of

569
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,860
which one we

570
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,940
that images

571
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,530
ten million

572
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,260
while men

573
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,530
but i think it's

574
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,860
o point

575
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,030
you should be able to

576
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,240
the object which is the

577
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,650
it to

578
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,570
x one

579
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,380
if we use some information

580
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,720
the two

581
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,860
there should be a

582
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,650
and the same true

583
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,070
so i would keep should be

584
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,880
in very

585
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,260
that's amazing

586
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,570
the water there

587
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,510
this approach is that he

588
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,570
you just have

589
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,090
which was proposed by

590
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,990
the main

591
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,800
what those

592
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,950
and the brain

593
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,380
scale depending on the room where we were

594
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,620
this step is called people the village

595
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:29,300
average takes different values on Gaussian data and Laplace data and the best function

596
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,580
here subject to this constraint of course that the length of the function should be

597
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:39,340
at most one measured in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space the best function is this

598
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:44,260
red function so here this dotted line is the laplacian data the dash line is the gaussian

599
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:51,600
data or distribution generating the data and this function distinguishes them this red one so you

600
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,520
can see this function takes positive value as where the laplacian is

601
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:01,080
more likely than the gaussian it takes negative values here on the side

602
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:11,360
where the gaussian is higher and it sort of goes to zero asymptotically so that's interesting function

603
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:16,980
and we can generalize I'm not gonna go into all details here just wanna

604
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:22,240
mention we can generalize this from data sets two measures so we can

605
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,100
takes two I mean  this is a little bit more mathematical and maybe you don't

606
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,940
have to follow all details if you're not interested in mathematics  but instead of

607
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:36,370
data points you can take probability measures you have to make certain assumptions and

608
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:41,880
some things are finite and then rather than mapping a set of points into their mean

609
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:48,360
in the feature space we just map probability measure into its expectation in the feature space

610
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,140
so you can think of this as taking all the points from the measure so

611
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:56,360
X is sampled from the measure mapping them into the feature space and

612
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,500
then we take the average of all those so that's a single point that characterizes

613
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:07,900
probability measure of course it's a point in a high-dimensional space and like

614
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:15,460
before this point represents the operation of not taking the average but taking expectations

615
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:21,060
and also to a probability measures will map to a different points if there's a

616
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:28,460
function in the reproducing kernel hibert space which takes different expectations subject to these two different

617
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:34,880
distributions and  interestingly it will also turned out that this characterizes the probability measure

618
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,500
so we can if we do things right  we don't lose any information in

619
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:45,680
this procedure and I want to mention this because it's related to an interesting issue

620
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:52,300
that you might see somewhere in the kernel research world it's the notion

621
00:38:52,300 --> 00:39:01,420
of universality of kernels so it turns out maybe I'll stop with this down here if K

622
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:08,120
is a universal kernel I'll tell you something about this in the second then two probability measures

623
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:14,300
are the same if and only if that representations in the reproducing kernel hilbert space are the same

624
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,040
now first of all it's clear that if two probability measures are the same then their representations

625
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,380
are the same that's trivial but if the representations are the same it turns out we

626
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,120
can infer that the probability measures are the same so again this mapping mu does

627
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:34,780
not lose any information about P and Q here so why is this true this is

628
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:41,200
true because we can reduce it to a classical theorem of probability theory which

629
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:46,120
I'll briefly mention because I think you will all get the intuition for this and this theorem

630
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:52,300
says that two  probability measures are the same if and only if we can find

631
00:39:52,300 --> 00:40:01,190
some continuous function which has a different expectation according to the one measure and according

632
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:08,300
to the other one so that means well first of all let's assume F

633
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:16,520
is the identity mapping here that means here we have the statement that the means of

634
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,060
the distributions or the expectations are the same here we have the statement that the distributions are

635
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:26,960
the same now clearly if the distributions are the same the expectations are the same but

636
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,200
not necessarily vice-versa but but this theorem says that if you are allowed to transform

637
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:38,280
the data non linearly with some general continuous function so if you are allowed to take

638
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,480
nonlinear transformations of your data then it's actually enough to just check whether the

639
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:49,900
means are the same okay and this can be translated into the corresponding statement for our

640
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:55,600
case simply by taking a reproducing kernel hilbert space which is dense in the set

641
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:01,160
of continuous functions which means that it's a reproducing kernel hilbert space which is so rich that

642
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:08,060
every continuous function can be approximated arbitrarily closely by elements or by sequences in that

643
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:13,420
reproducing kernel hilbert space and it turns out that's exactly what this notion

644
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:19,280
of universality  is good for so universal kernels have this property that the reproducing kernel

645
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:29,380
hilbert  space is so rich that they basically contain every continuous function okay so I'm not expecting

646
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,060
that you follow in all details but I also wanted to mention a few things

647
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,160
that are close to the current research and it's nice if you have these things

648
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:44,760
already and see where they belong and what they're good  for so in that case if

649
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:50,380
we have a universal kernel  this mapping mu is invertible on its image and its

650
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,420
image actually is also of interest in other domains in machine learning it has been called

651
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,210
OK let's let's read restart

652
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,040
welcome back

653
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,120
OK so i'm going to pick up where i if you remember i kind of

654
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,530
didn't quite get to the end of my first

655
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,460
section part a that i was going to talk about so out of start by

656
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,350
going through the rest of that picking up where i left off and then go

657
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,370
into the

658
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,870
rademacher complexity section that

659
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,010
i'd also like to talk about

660
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,270
which is you know the sort of second second part so just sort of you

661
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,690
know recap

662
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,190
bring it back to where we were

663
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,190
we were looking at these basic sort of scheme of

664
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,440
analysis that supplied in

665
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,190
extending these analysis methods to

666
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,390
infinite classes of functions

667
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,870
and the idea was to first use this double sample trick to sort of replace

668
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,870
very fancy

669
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:00,610
it is OK agree

670
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:05,450
get rid of this test point and replaced by a a sample

671
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,690
so we're now just looking at probabilities over double samples

672
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,530
there's just an event here which we can analyse

673
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,060
and indeed we can now just choose ourselves by

674
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,030
looking at the possible

675
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,450
behaviours of

676
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:23,010
the function class on a sample of size two n

677
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:28,500
we actually find out there's only BH of two n possible behaviors here

678
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:31,920
and so we can do a union bound over that set of behavior so rather

679
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,830
than having an infinite set was suddenly down to a finite set and it in

680
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:41,670
fact very much immeasurably sized finite set this h two n and then we can

681
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:45,560
treat this as if it's a fixed function and we're just taking the sample

682
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:50,590
relative to a fixed function and then there's this observation it's pretty weird that all

683
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:55,500
the errors in the second half

684
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,590
that's the so-called growth function

685
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,310
which was the number of different behaviours

686
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:07,680
that the function class exhibits on that set of two n points

687
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,110
so if you think of behaviors you know classifying the first one positive second negative

688
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,270
false positive etcetera

689
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:15,950
you know binary sequence

690
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,160
there are two to the two m possibles

691
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,160
but actually a function class

692
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:25,860
of VC dimension you know lopez dimension will actually exhibit much fewer than

693
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:30,800
actually a polynomial number in that case so that's that number

694
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,330
OK and

695
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:35,260
you don't you know you don't actually need to calculate the numbers just there to

696
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,020
get the band you see i mean you need to calculate if you need to

697
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:41,950
think about actually you know enumerating in any sense

698
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:48,080
so then this symmetrisation trick which is basically just formalising that intuition that it's weird

699
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,880
that the

700
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,390
errors all in the second half

701
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:55,320
i should say that you know i've i've treated the zero error case but you

702
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,510
can imagine here

703
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,300
if this was a low error

704
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,930
in the first half and high area in the second half you could apply the

705
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:06,860
same argument is weird that so many more errors in the second half the first

706
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:12,730
and you could you know about the probability of that happening by random mutation and

707
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:18,240
that's exactly you know what to do for the the non-zero error case and so

708
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,820
this formalizes that in symmetrisation and and we can see that there is actually to

709
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:30,210
to the EM permutations and to to the probability of actually putting those guys in

710
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,700
the wrong half is to the mindset slonim over two

711
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,570
it's this number here

712
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:39,170
and just putting all together gives us this this bound

713
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,360
so that was the the sort of standard VC bound

714
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,200
and this was the corresponding lower bound which sort of made this

715
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:50,230
slightly nervous because we

716
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:51,350
i feel that

717
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,330
some sort of implies that things are

718
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:59,260
closed out the that's that's it you know characterization mathematically is is finished

719
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:04,010
and this was the result you get if you consider the non zero error so

720
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,520
if you make k errors on the first half

721
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,700
you wouldn't expect to make more than this number

722
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:13,040
are on the on the in the test

723
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,480
are you know test probability

724
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:25,970
yes strictly speaking the non-zero case treats the zero error but i haven't seen anyone

725
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:27,510
overpressure here

726
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,380
for your lungs

727
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,990
and the water is one atmosphere of pressure

728
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:33,550
here is one atmosphere

729
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,880
barometric pressure

730
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:38,070
was one of the few high static pressure plus the barometric pressure

731
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,070
you have to have this

732
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:42,630
research which forced on chest

733
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,930
inside your lungs one atmosphere

734
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,930
outside these two atmospheres

735
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:48,110
and there's no way

736
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,760
that you could break

737
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,260
the area of my chest is some thirty by thirty centimeters with thousand square centimeters

738
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,740
it would be like having a hundred kilogram weight on my chest and also on

739
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,510
my back and forth

740
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,880
in both directions which is like this

741
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,200
and pushes like this and like this and like this

742
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,880
really being squeezed that

743
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:10,380
so what do you do when you go scuba diving

744
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,050
repression of a which

745
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,590
thank you

746
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:15,200
and that your brain

747
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,130
so now with depression there

748
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,780
you can obviously counter

749
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,260
the hydrophilic pressure

750
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,800
the water

751
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:24,820
now suppose

752
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,840
we go snorkeling

753
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,010
the difference

754
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,300
then we do have a little too

755
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,950
you know

756
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,110
and we store

757
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,680
how do you think we could work

758
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,680
are ones could easily accommodate

759
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,860
i that pressure

760
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,420
and the idea

761
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,260
i think we could snorkel maybe three years

762
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,490
all things we could easily do three new

763
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,800
how things

764
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,920
maybe only one meter

765
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:57,150
well things

766
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,180
well less than one

767
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,570
you know it's not way less because no because that long so you know you

768
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:08,380
can at least thirty centimetres can be what that much less

769
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,630
we can measure

770
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,860
how did we could snorkel

771
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,240
and we can measure

772
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,610
what the capacity capabilities

773
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:20,150
of the are in order to counter

774
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:24,610
i just added pressure

775
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:28,420
if i'm underwater there is pressure on my chest

776
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,780
so too

777
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,470
let the air out is easy

778
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:34,130
just screen right that goes out

779
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,800
but in order to inhale

780
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,590
so in the air

781
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,050
i would have to

782
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,740
push out my chest

783
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,220
voice that counters

784
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,260
the force

785
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:53,490
and so the question is

786
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,510
what kind of pressure could generate

787
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,470
with my lungs

788
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,130
it added pressure

789
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,530
and we are going to measure that they

790
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:10,260
which an instrument that we call an anomaly

791
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,930
it's a simple to

792
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,990
could be made of anything less two find

793
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,430
and we have liquid in here

794
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:27,010
open year

795
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,260
it is open here

796
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:33,090
put my mouth here

797
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,280
i'm going to see

798
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,780
how much of pressure

799
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,630
i can

800
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:40,200
using my lungs by pushing by blowing

801
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,530
so i'm going to blow in a year

802
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:44,610
and then this level will go down

803
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,880
and this level will go up

804
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,860
this height difference

805
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,320
let's call the age

806
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,050
and the density of the fluid

807
00:49:56,050 --> 00:50:00,180
we'll use water for that call it what it

808
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,760
the pressure here

809
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,490
y one

810
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,400
because the one

811
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,510
depression here

812
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,490
y two

813
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:14,570
of the two

814
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:16,380
so p one

815
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,490
minus b two

816
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,660
times age

817
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,260
i apply

818
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,930
the law that we still have a few one minus two

819
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,380
all times age

820
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,650
i've seen

821
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,050
i know that the

822
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,700
two level is

823
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,280
one atmosphere

824
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,800
that's correct

825
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,260
one atmosphere that often

826
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,490
the world

827
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,180
so p one

828
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,990
because one atmosphere

829
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,950
was rho h

830
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:52,530
so what my my to indicate

831
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,800
how much pressure i can generate

832
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,800
over and above the one atmosphere

833
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:02,920
and we call that overpressure often work with over pressure gauges when you go to

834
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,590
gas station and you have pressures

835
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,550
measure the pressure in your tires is also

836
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,360
o gauge which measures the overpressure

837
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,180
right there

838
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,760
we have such an knowledge there

839
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,030
i'm going to blow it here

840
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:23,900
and that's going to tell us immediately how deep i can snorkel

841
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:26,130
if i was able

842
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,470
to make this high difference

843
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,570
ten metres

844
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,930
then i could

845
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:37,880
snorkel and the depth of ten metres in the water

846
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:42,380
because it means that i could generate an over pressure of one atmosphere

847
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:46,680
this would only be five metres then i could only snorkel down to five metres

848
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,070
this is only

849
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,700
said one meter

850
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,400
and i could really only confidently brave

851
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:53,720
one meter below

852
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,740
the surface

853
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,090
that's what you see here

854
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:01,450
and i want you to

855
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:02,900
and here

856
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:10,180
and he

857
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,430
you have

858
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:48,030
so what we do

859
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:42,080
and you can use

860
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,520
i mean

861
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:18,880
in any event

862
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:33,200
you can be a

863
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:45,530
in the

864
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:07,370
you know

865
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:15,610
we can

866
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,050
i mean

867
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,380
at all

868
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:04,240
less than one mile one

869
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:07,160
how do you

870
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:30,930
he always

871
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,390
and then be to

872
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,350
so you need

873
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:39,000
OK at the last

874
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:50,680
well one way

875
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:53,220
one one three

876
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,590
and the graph is like this

877
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,250
graph laplacian you can just basically think of it as the adjacency matrix is very

878
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:03,380
similar to the adjacency matrix of the graph

879
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:09,670
so it's some matrix and the key property of this matrix

880
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:15,480
let me just reiterate if the following that this quantity so when i some

881
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:18,830
my so if i have a function on the graph i want to check whether

882
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:23,400
the function is small and when i sum of all adjacent vertices

883
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:27,170
i get something which is small that's the nicest most function so i only from

884
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:31,220
about adjacent vertices i don't care about sources which are far so for this graph

885
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,150
in particular described

886
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:37,620
and this is the same as f transpose l

887
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:40,540
OK so

888
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:41,940
now what do we do

889
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,870
and again if this

890
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,390
we have some points

891
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:48,680
this is our point cloud this maybe

892
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,280
the ones and nines

893
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,330
we connect points which are close together in some sense

894
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:58,110
and this can be epsilon ball that can be nearest neighbours nearest neighbour seem to

895
01:00:58,110 --> 01:00:59,510
work well

896
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:05,870
and then you put it this way

897
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,550
on the

898
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:10,540
and then you construct lot

899
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,620
now let's proceed with

900
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:17,560
semi supervised learning

901
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:23,830
what is the problem now of semi supervised learning

902
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,480
you have day labelled data x i y i

903
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:28,590
and a

904
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:32,380
i assume that this simple from some high dimensional space so this may be images

905
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:37,700
and image is represented by its pixel greyscale that's a pixel wireless

906
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:42,940
and then there are some outputs which may be minus one and one for example

907
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:46,290
for classification or real number for regression

908
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:49,290
and plus the unlabelled data

909
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:53,720
unlabelled data if the a bunch of point a bunch of say images

910
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,640
but they have no choice

911
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,910
so we would like to use this

912
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,300
purposes of our

913
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:05,570
inference so we would like to construct a function which takes

914
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,470
the labelled data center

915
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,620
and unlabelled data sets

916
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:20,220
and construct some sort of output which will predict new point

917
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:23,920
OK so this is again a reminder

918
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:30,220
so i will be working in the kernel framework and this is

919
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,980
in there for support vector machines regularizes so this is the square put hinge loss

920
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:40,330
here for support vector versions you have fit to the data

921
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:47,800
rkhs penalty which somehow controls how much the function calls so you have fit to

922
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,620
the data plus most of

923
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:52,170
and the penalty is what we're going to change

924
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:57,710
the panel to somehow incorporate else most this assumption about today

925
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:02,880
so as standard algorithm and again i'm just repeating this very quickly you do this

926
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,260
you can you have to represent the same so you get the solution in terms

927
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:08,170
of kernels of you labeled points

928
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:13,460
and fully squares you can compute it by matrix inversion for SVM the quadratic programming

929
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:19,530
so you compute alpha cen this is function

930
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:24,490
so here is the example i have for more examples later but here is a

931
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:26,160
very basic for example

932
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,590
this is the support vector machine classifier

933
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:29,420
it just

934
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,880
separate this point

935
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,380
this school it knows nothing about unlabelled data of course so it cannot

936
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,860
this is not necessarily a very good classifier because somehow

937
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:44,970
this unlabelled data doing something

938
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:48,870
to change your perception about where the boundary so you might want to

939
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,540
the is some of the boundary

940
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:52,840
and here is what you get was

941
01:03:52,920 --> 01:04:00,180
the with this modified algorithm basically depending on the value of parameters to control how

942
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:03,190
the geometry of the data affected by

943
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,290
so you have this extra nor

944
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,110
which allows you to to torn up

945
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,820
so when of unlabelled data

946
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:15,110
and then i will explain what the

947
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:16,110
so now

948
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,710
so this is

949
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,740
the first the

950
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:24,520
framework called manifold regularisation

951
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:30,660
so it's basically the same thing as before with the coral what the differences

952
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:36,510
we now want to say we actually want our function not just a small everywhere

953
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:39,290
this term here the chance that a single

954
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:43,110
function doesn't make mistake is actually not so small it's one over the number of

955
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:46,790
e to the log f is one over

956
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,140
so what we get is that actually it's quite likely that one of these that

957
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,720
functions will be there and will soil

958
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:59,710
why because each one has like one or have chance of filing as after them

959
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,520
so it's actually

960
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,500
quite reasonable that one of them will fire less and will pick one of the

961
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,630
bad functions instead of this great function

962
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:07,850
and we'll get air

963
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:10,360
about log f over

964
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:14,850
and that's what we saw in the online setting so we're starting already to get

965
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:19,080
was starting already taken a sense that the online setting is a bit like batch

966
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:21,920
and this is something that there is a lot of research in the online setting

967
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,690
of research in the best the thing and there's been many times everyone in this

968
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:28,320
area is kind of observing that very similar

969
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:32,730
but but today i'm going to show you way in which they are actually the

970
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:39,080
OK so

971
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:40,590
let's not just

972
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:44,900
go over what happens to the naive algorithm the batch algorithm which is very simple

973
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:49,070
you take an examples and now let's look at it in a noisy setting or

974
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:53,230
not and i said with there's no perfect function why should we sing perfectly so

975
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:57,160
we just choose the function that minimizes the error on the

976
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,680
i don't know i don't think it's quite we're through with me to go through

977
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,250
the analysis but let me just tell you the punchline

978
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:06,570
the point is that the regret

979
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:12,230
in expectation of this naive batch learning algorithm on the distribution mill

980
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,400
is going to be

981
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,570
something like one over the square root of n

982
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:20,660
and what's the intuition behind them

983
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,490
it's if you flip a coin n times

984
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:26,530
you can expect to get about another two heads

985
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:31,500
you probably get like and over two plus some something which depends on the standard

986
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,980
deviation which is actually one of them you probably get like and over two plus

987
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:37,580
and minus one of the n

988
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:42,350
so now we have this we have a bunch of functions we functions were measuring

989
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:46,160
the area of each one in the dataset each one's estimate of variance is pretty

990
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,160
but actually there will be some that that are

991
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:52,790
some that are ranked too high and some that are into low

992
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:56,530
and it turns out that when you have f of you can expect some of

993
01:06:56,530 --> 01:07:00,250
them to be off by as much as this term

994
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:02,540
this is

995
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:06,330
so this is kind of what you expect in the back setting when you just

996
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:10,410
use this very simple algorithm in these things are similar to what you see in

997
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:13,960
the analysis of VC dimension

998
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:17,860
here's is the analysis of why that's the case but i think i'll skip

999
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:22,180
OK so now let me show you an online algorithm that's kind of nice very

1000
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:23,460
famous algorithm

1001
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:27,740
i'm going to start with a slightly modified version that simply so the weighted majority

1002
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:33,190
i because when israeli prime houses this algorithm working online setting again we're not assuming

1003
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,520
now that the data is perfect is have

1004
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:37,800
this data and these functions and you trying to do as well as the best

1005
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,390
so the algorithm just assign a weight to each one of the functions

1006
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:46,580
for each function we start with its weight being one

1007
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:50,020
in each period we're going to just predict according to

1008
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,930
the majority of the functions but now we're going to take a weighted majority because

1009
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:55,690
each function has always associated to

1010
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:59,570
and then what are we gonna do how we can update the weights we're going

1011
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:06,240
divide the weight of every function areas by two so we have the weights of

1012
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,580
all the guys together and wrong cut

1013
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:14,140
actually this point you might be wondering why don't we just take the function that

1014
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,680
does the best so far

1015
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:17,460
on the data

1016
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:21,320
that's much more intuitive right if you're living in online worlds baby you get a

1017
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,930
bunch of examples

1018
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,320
why not just you know if you considering a bunch of candidate functions when i

1019
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,620
take the function that is the best

1020
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,100
at least theoretically and in many cases especially in game play six games

1021
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,560
nine cases that's not going to work so i'll give you an example of a

1022
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:39,780
real world example is kind of like when you're driving on the road

1023
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:42,630
and you have two lanes and you have to decide which lead to go on

1024
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:45,270
don't you always feel like you turn into the lane

1025
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:49,080
that stops see you on the highway in one of the lines advancing the other

1026
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,220
one isn't so imagine a situation where you have two choices and you have to

1027
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:53,510
choose between them

1028
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,470
and you just take the one that did the best so far

1029
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,820
so in that case

1030
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:01,600
let's say one of them does well on the other one as well and the

1031
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,690
first one does well in the second alternate how well they do it

1032
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:06,870
and you take the one that's the the best so far

1033
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:11,170
if you just so unlucky that there really alternating which one is doing better

1034
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:14,080
you're always going to go to the one that's about to get stuck

1035
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:16,920
you're going to go to the to the lane that's not gonna that's going to

1036
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,820
keep moving back and forth and you actually get make any progress

1037
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,580
o thing

1038
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:26,420
and that's what happens right when you try to strategy you just just keep changing

1039
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:28,110
lanes to get into better life

1040
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:32,080
and the same thing can happen in the case of learning we have a bunch

1041
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,300
of functions and you're trying

1042
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,320
but this is a rare

1043
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:40,820
a reduction

1044
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:43,280
in very simple

1045
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:48,050
not separable

1046
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:54,720
this reduction

1047
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,450
can be applied to show

1048
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:01,950
you start from an ongoing has the mistake bound or lot about

1049
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:04,300
four in the separable case

1050
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:08,010
reduce any nonseparable

1051
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:12,550
OK so that was used in general nonseparable case the separable

1052
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,890
so basically you can

1053
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:19,610
with no way for you can

1054
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:26,450
did you can derive bound that is the version of the parable is the modification

1055
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:30,800
of the separable but will hold in general purpose

1056
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,840
it because the perceptron algorithm remains the same

1057
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:39,740
you have a you have about the perceptron in the separable case and turn it

1058
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:43,220
into a ball in the separable case

1059
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,950
which is different but the argument

1060
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,200
for this one year

1061
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:52,050
the other which which is slightly and then we show how

1062
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:58,390
this technique was introduced first by class number class now

1063
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:06,110
and has has already been on

1064
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:07,700
ninety five

1065
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,280
and your friend roberta theory

1066
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:16,320
in the discovery gain a few years later four years later

1067
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:19,280
to prove

1068
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,780
another version of the of the general board

1069
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,410
you might think it to the perceptron you don't get the bound showed before

1070
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:32,220
you get about that involves the square the squares of the input

1071
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:35,220
and so if the different about

1072
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,180
but there is a bounded

1073
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:38,890
the same goes for the

1074
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:41,470
and now i'm showing you will be studied

1075
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:43,370
OK what the so

1076
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:45,610
OK let's look at the

1077
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:46,930
yeah i agree

1078
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:49,800
the algorithm makes an update

1079
01:11:49,820 --> 01:12:01,340
we get this

1080
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,720
we take it as an arbitrary

1081
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:16,280
not linearly separable

1082
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:23,180
and we fix the samuel

1083
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:26,050
and you guys

1084
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:31,110
and now we know that you will have some on each example has some loss

1085
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:39,430
and we do not help you put his loss of you on what

1086
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:41,410
so now we

1087
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:47,680
so next time constants

1088
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:51,860
the figure on the right hand

1089
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:56,680
we see that the total we take the stream and we just put it into

1090
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:00,200
a different frame that would be parable by u

1091
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:09,510
so this transformation this mapping is done in that if one we observed by dr

1092
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:13,490
and we have to show that this is actually true

1093
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:18,140
so we redefined the stream so that it is linearly separable

1094
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,720
with a large margin but you

1095
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:28,780
it we take every example x and we might be all x b prime

1096
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,910
so a prime would be a vector

1097
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:36,340
it was first the components of the components of xty

1098
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:40,200
and then we are adding component

1099
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,510
all the wrong

1100
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:46,010
up to what he called for the people

1101
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:49,160
last component

1102
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,800
which would be

1103
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,240
one of our squirrel pups

1104
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:56,050
so this is the component that he

1105
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:00,840
and then we feel out with zero

1106
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,160
up to to the

1107
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,720
the plastic

1108
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,360
so this vector now using this space which is

1109
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,860
as people have been become boring

1110
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:17,930
would be the the the length of the string so we have at dimensions

1111
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:20,640
one-dimensional bridge back

1112
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:24,030
for example in the

1113
01:14:24,110 --> 01:14:26,800
OK here

1114
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:30,240
but it's one of these guys will have but in the experiments that would be

1115
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,590
all zero but the one that will be

1116
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:34,630
that's that

1117
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:41,070
now we do similar thing for you

1118
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:42,300
your prime

1119
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:45,800
you prime is the mapping of u

1120
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:47,130
which is

1121
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:49,220
the the following types

1122
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:53,070
it's a game that the first component of the components of u

1123
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:54,910
and then we feel

1124
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:57,910
components of the former square root of c

1125
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,320
l one

1126
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,450
l one is one of the

1127
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:06,010
so this is the hinge loss of u on the first example

1128
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:07,720
we're about see

1129
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,050
l two

1130
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:12,090
up to the root of c

1131
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:16,430
again this guy

1132
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:20,300
with be the with either in the article that must be

1133
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,320
thank you

1134
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:24,970
but think easy checked that

1135
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:27,160
you prime achieves

1136
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,140
has zero involved

1137
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:34,720
on the same for the primal scream

1138
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,970
with the brain and this is

1139
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:39,780
seen as follows

1140
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,950
so if you look at on a generic example why the new prime

1141
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:47,280
x b prime

1142
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:50,570
we want to check for any this is bigger than one

1143
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:54,320
but this is what this is why we

1144
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:57,260
now if you

1145
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,300
in the

1146
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,340
and then i have

1147
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,490
x being

1148
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:03,840
so these are the

1149
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:07,840
first the components of new prime in the first component next prime

1150
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:11,660
then we have just the one non-zero component connected prime

1151
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:16,090
which is the one associated with the people of the

1152
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,700
but this is going to be

1153
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:22,570
of one over the

1154
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:25,030
and this will multiply

1155
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:28,340
plus component over here

1156
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,320
which is square root of c and

1157
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:38,180
OK so we have y

1158
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,140
x anywhere else

1159
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:48,010
which we can write so if healthy zero then we know that this mountain is

1160
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:53,200
already because then one if there is no zero then it can be written as

1161
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:57,550
plus one minus y u

1162
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:59,990
x t

1163
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:05,980
which is a set of objects we're talking about

1164
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:08,640
so that's the set

1165
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,460
so nonempty set

1166
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:13,390
don't talk about the the empty universe

1167
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,880
it is a boring place

1168
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:22,050
we take the universe to be not empty which is not very extravagant assumptions

1169
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:24,900
and we want to take thing that's come

1170
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:27,420
that's got objects inside it

1171
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,880
and we want to be able to do things we want to be able to

1172
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:35,600
name objects

1173
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:42,010
so we suppose that in a in our language we've got some sort of names

1174
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:45,500
robin ince things like

1175
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:51,920
kevin rudd whatever

1176
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,320
proper names

1177
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:55,560
picking out things

1178
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,140
and it's not enough just to be able to name them we want to be

1179
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:01,040
able to say things about the

1180
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:03,930
so we want to be able to form some

1181
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:08,160
assertions such statements some sentences

1182
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:11,400
therefore we need some way of getting from names

1183
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:13,700
to sentences

1184
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:18,180
what we need is some predicates

1185
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:22,910
well we assume that we're dealing with a language that has pretty kids

1186
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:28,130
is some expression

1187
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:34,120
into which you can plug names

1188
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:34,900
and it

1189
01:18:38,060 --> 01:18:39,010
OK so

1190
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,740
the type of the predicates

1191
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:42,500
it takes

1192
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:46,430
names possibly

1193
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:50,050
possibly all bunch of names

1194
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,440
and gives you

1195
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,590
a sentence

1196
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:58,960
so if i have names like a camera

1197
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,230
sydney golden

1198
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,300
you might predicates like

1199
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:05,350
is a city

1200
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:10,550
into which you can put one of those names and get the sentence

1201
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:15,970
is larger than

1202
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:21,790
in two which you can put two names and get things like canberra is larger

1203
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:24,560
than sydney which is false

1204
01:19:24,610 --> 01:19:28,090
sydney is larger than golden which is true

1205
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:31,310
by plugging into names

1206
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:34,830
you get a sentence

1207
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,120
we assume that we can

1208
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:40,660
at atomic

1209
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:45,330
in that way

1210
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:49,820
that doesn't yet give us a lot of logic

1211
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:52,210
what we need to be able to do

1212
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:55,750
this put those atoms together to get molecular

1213
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:02,300
will exhibit some regular behaviour

1214
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:08,710
we go into is from here

1215
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,360
first of all we had

1216
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:21,360
we assume well we assume we dealing with a language with some connectives in

1217
01:20:21,370 --> 01:20:23,380
these are

1218
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,570
apply to

1219
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:35,760
to form

1220
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:38,620
longer sentences

1221
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:48,500
so the things of type sentence to sentence or sentence sentence to sentence

1222
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:57,480
and natural languages have lots of connectives in everybody's favourite connective is and

1223
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:59,120
as all the others are a bit

1224
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:02,040
unruly but and is

1225
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,230
what the

1226
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:12,620
this takes two sentences and forms along sentence

1227
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:19,660
or as the logicians say it is not the case that

1228
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,220
which takes one sentence and forms along sentence

1229
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:25,790
that says the opposite

1230
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,410
which takes

1231
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:36,420
sentence and forms along sentence that says that the first

1232
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,730
could be the case

1233
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:48,420
john believes

1234
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:54,380
OK which is again

1235
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:55,520
one place

1236
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:59,260
you put in a sentence here

1237
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,440
express some proposition

1238
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:06,010
and you get out along a longer sentence

1239
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:10,510
the truth value of the long sentence in that case is not very interesting really

1240
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:14,690
i've been noticing you around and this i find you very attractive

1241
01:22:14,690 --> 01:22:17,970
would you go with me tonight would you come over to my apartment and i

1242
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:20,300
would you got the bed of me tonight

1243
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:25,110
experiment you wouldn't think anybody would have done has been done in women

1244
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:29,530
about the two very attractive man over half of the women approach

1245
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:31,510
so yeah i will

1246
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:35,820
very few agreed this and nobody agrees to this

1247
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:36,890
four men

1248
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,560
but there are like this

1249
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:40,750
they got that

1250
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:49,710
in this study

1251
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:52,110
twenty five percent of males

1252
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:56,860
who said no i apologize profusely this at all you know my feelings in town

1253
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,060
until you

1254
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:05,000
what about behavior

1255
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:08,510
you know if interested in sex differences

1256
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:12,640
you can actually

1257
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:19,110
figure out what people want male-female differences by looking at simply the the average number

1258
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:20,860
of times people have sex

1259
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:26,650
it male and females have different priorities than heterosexual sex is a compromise

1260
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:30,040
between two groups of people of competing interests

1261
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:34,930
what's more clear reflection and is gay sex

1262
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:39,200
between women between two women are between two men

1263
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:41,880
because then you get pure reflection

1264
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:45,920
of sexual desire

1265
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:49,560
the data tend to be very messy again to survey studies

1266
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:54,070
but by and large we study done tends to find the difference in the expected

1267
01:23:54,070 --> 01:24:00,710
direction which is that females tend to be lesbians tend to be much more monogamous

1268
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,380
then game

1269
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:06,740
some studies prior to that prior to AIDS

1270
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:08,460
so many years ago

1271
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:12,970
i found came into to be extremely promiscuous often having over one hundred over thousand

1272
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:17,080
partners you wouldn't find this sort of promiscuity in

1273
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:20,490
in females and the way to think about this is what is gay men are

1274
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:24,970
doing is exactly what you average heterosexual men would do

1275
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:29,990
if he had that degree of willing females were is willing as he was

1276
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:34,340
and this all suggested or some sort of different along lines expected

1277
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:37,940
in sexual choosing in humans

1278
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,170
what about

1279
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:41,870
sexual attractiveness

1280
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:45,330
what about make preference what we find attractive

1281
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:51,790
unlike the choosing to study here we actually have some pretty good cross-cultural data

1282
01:24:51,810 --> 01:24:54,000
so one study for instance was done

1283
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:55,560
in ten thousand people

1284
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:57,210
from thirty seven countries

1285
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:59,510
ask people who want

1286
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:01,300
we want to be one

1287
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:05,510
and there's different studies some of them who do you want to marry her other

1288
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:09,050
studies one as of may twenty one is the sexual partners

1289
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:13,900
and one main finding is

1290
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:15,500
kind reassuring

1291
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,820
everybody likes kindness and intelligence

1292
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:20,760
or everybody says like kindness and intelligence

1293
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,840
these are value pretty highly

1294
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:25,840
but at the same time there are sex differences

1295
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,480
on females

1296
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:30,120
focus more on power and status

1297
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:34,420
and more on interest investing in children and think about that from an evolutionary point

1298
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:37,470
of view it makes sense it doesn't matter hugely

1299
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,410
from the standpoint of reproduction

1300
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:41,730
how old the matters

1301
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:47,090
the difference between fifteen and twenty five thirty five forty five matteral offer status in

1302
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:51,490
the community physical strength is lifespan but from the standpoint of the sperm it doesn't

1303
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:53,020
matter hugely

1304
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:55,140
later on this drop off

1305
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:58,120
and it does begin to matter but doesn't matter hugely

1306
01:25:58,730 --> 01:26:01,780
what does matter is interesting being a good father

1307
01:26:01,810 --> 01:26:03,220
in protecting u

1308
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:05,190
from predation from murder

1309
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:09,710
from assault by other people and in taking care of the kids

1310
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:14,990
women's brains are wired up to five males those properties similar

1311
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:19,460
focus little bit differently they're more interested

1312
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:22,500
in all of these things but also inability to have children

1313
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:26,580
so from an evolutionary point of view there's actually a very big difference between a

1314
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:28,860
twenty year-old and a fifty year-old

1315
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:33,490
from a male standpoint looking at the female because the one can have offspring another

1316
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:36,750
so this is the difference

1317
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,940
what i want to focus more on right now

1318
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:43,260
is back to another similarity

1319
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:46,140
everybody likes beauty

1320
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:50,030
and i want to devote a little bit of this lecture to talking about physical

1321
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:52,550
physical beauty

1322
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:54,740
as these beautiful people say

1323
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:55,980
is the curse

1324
01:26:55,990 --> 01:27:00,030
so she's she's like a big models supermodels

1325
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:02,480
in the super super model

1326
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:04,780
points out the arbitrariness

1327
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:07,720
of finding her devastatingly beautiful

1328
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:11,020
famous actor points enough respirators

1329
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:12,270
people only

1330
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:16,480
ignore his accomplishments and focus merely on its physical beauty

1331
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:18,070
the very first

1332
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:25,650
so what is really what does this mean when we say we find we you

1333
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:28,880
we really are very attractive people

1334
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:33,090
what is it about that makes you look and say yes that makes sense

1335
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:37,070
we kind of know that we know some universals

1336
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:40,730
beauty seems to signal two things

1337
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,060
you're using signal u

1338
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:44,970
i mean not preschool

1339
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,080
but but

1340
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,040
because the

1341
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:50,430
the cause effect relation

1342
01:27:50,530 --> 01:27:52,590
this is the more

1343
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,180
many things

1344
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:12,730
the last major applications in the future

1345
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:16,610
this is a lot of plants

1346
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:22,870
the only forty seven today so thanks for coming so what are we talking about

1347
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:27,160
is how to detect the virus outbreaks in networks effectively so what we will be

1348
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:32,590
thinking about is how do things spread over the network so for example here i

1349
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:40,660
OK here this would be for example this is a network of how people recommended

1350
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:44,670
DVD sufficient to each other and this this the second one is a network of

1351
01:28:44,670 --> 01:28:51,220
how some disease i think spread over the social network so what what should be

1352
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:56,560
sure what should be thinking about so diffusion or some kind of propagation social network

1353
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,530
is one of the fundamental processes and basically the idea is that we have some

1354
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:03,980
behaviors something

1355
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:09,560
so that the spreads through the network so this could be like new spreading over

1356
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:14,410
the network or like all through the social network or fans or urban legends or

1357
01:29:14,410 --> 01:29:18,700
some kind of what the mouth effects or diseases can also spread widely like flu

1358
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:23,310
and so on so this is this is our setting and there has been many

1359
01:29:23,810 --> 01:29:29,360
empirical studies about this diffusion in social networks and the two most or the one

1360
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:34,000
of the first two are the slalom the spread of new agricultural practices where they

1361
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,610
were asking far machine highlighting i think how they were adopting this new kind of

1362
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:44,010
gordon's seed and then the second and basically what would be conclusion was that diffusion

1363
01:29:44,010 --> 01:29:48,300
is a social process so basically this adoption of a new type of seed was

1364
01:29:48,410 --> 01:29:52,450
was was a social process through like discussion so far as to each other in

1365
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:57,670
sort of decided that they would try out this new and something similar was then

1366
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:01,570
for the spread of new medical practices where the idea was that

1367
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:06,830
again they were studying how the adoption of a new antibiotic was done between the

1368
01:30:06,830 --> 01:30:11,360
doctors and again it was the social power of peers that's all sort of made

1369
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:14,920
some some youth orchestra start describing this

1370
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:21,550
this the this new new vaccine so more precisely what do i mean right so

1371
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:24,630
when i say diffusion what i mean is that what i mean by that is

1372
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:28,110
that we are giving some kind of social network we have some set of initially

1373
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:32,020
active loads and now nodes sort of go and in fact

1374
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:35,170
the nodes and these and these are behavior

1375
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:39,800
propagates through the network and more precisely what we will be

1376
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:45,350
talking about today's is given a city water distribution network right so these are the

1377
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:50,450
houses and there are pipes like physical pipes through which water flows

1378
01:30:50,460 --> 01:30:55,100
and what we are interested in is if there would be some kind of contamination

1379
01:30:55,110 --> 01:31:00,980
start because one particular note this contamination spreads through the network right and what is

1380
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:03,210
our goal is to

1381
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:08,170
four percent of some of the nodes so that whenever this contamination starts

1382
01:31:08,210 --> 01:31:09,980
and started spreading around

1383
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:13,400
we detect it as quickly as possible and when i mean by that

1384
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:17,950
i mean we will raise an alarm and say hey there is infection or some

1385
01:31:17,950 --> 01:31:20,020
kind of disease spreading through the network

1386
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:25,300
and the raise the flag and the question is when should we place sensors to

1387
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:30,880
detect this kind of outbreaks as effectively as possible or a second scenario

1388
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:33,900
that will cover comes from this online media

1389
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,930
the idea is that if we have if we have some blog

1390
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:40,420
the that talks about something than other people who refer to it so they cited

1391
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:47,790
so this information spreads through the blogosphere right and the question is which blogs

1392
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,860
should we need to detect these stories as quickly as possible so to be most

1393
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:56,420
up to date which which are the influential bloggers blogs that captures the most important

1394
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:58,670
story so

1395
01:31:58,680 --> 01:31:59,820
more generally

1396
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:03,950
what what what what we want to be talking about is that we are given

1397
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:07,680
on the any process that spread through the network and we want to select a

1398
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:13,030
set of nodes to detect this process effectively and i will go into more details

1399
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:16,790
what effective means on the next slides and you can imagine that this is like

1400
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:21,370
a very general formulation of the problem that has many different applications right in epidemics

1401
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:24,580
and we want to know which people wanted to detect the

1402
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:28,410
disease outbreak as as quickly as possible in network security again you would like to

1403
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:31,960
select the set of machines that i know you want to very closely monitored to

1404
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,390
detect that some something wrong is going on in your network so so

1405
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:42,560
that is

1406
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,900
could be i don't know how much

1407
01:32:57,910 --> 01:33:02,010
this cascading is going on because i was heavily rely on the problem structure so

1408
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:08,310
now i start talking about what is what is what is like seemingly unrelated things

1409
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:13,090
what they have in common and you know what we have is like we have

1410
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:16,770
the reward and we have the cost right the reward mean some function that you're

1411
01:33:16,770 --> 01:33:21,870
trying to optimise so for example in the water distribution scenario you for example you

1412
01:33:21,870 --> 01:33:26,510
you may want to minimize time to detection rate whatever intrusion happens just want to

1413
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:30,930
detect this is detected as quickly as possible i know in the fewest number of

1414
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:35,460
hours possible then for example you may want to maximize the number of the active

1415
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:39,100
contaminations which would mean you just want to detect these contaminations

1416
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:41,830
as they happen so you don't get whole i just want to say oh that

1417
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:44,230
now are

1418
01:35:54,900 --> 01:36:03,810
this the

1419
01:36:03,810 --> 01:36:08,950
so here is an example that we studied and others studied a number of times

1420
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:12,240
over time series that is inversely related to

1421
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,310
northern hemispheric temperatures global temperatures

1422
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,620
going back from now over the last two-and-a-half million years

1423
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:23,120
and you can see some periodicities in there that are well known

1424
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,520
simply related to the earth orbital dynamics

1425
01:36:27,390 --> 01:36:29,560
they have a major influence on on

1426
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:35,310
on climate including me ice-age cycles various kinds that really other keep pieces this data

1427
01:36:36,910 --> 01:36:37,500
so when one

1428
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,610
it's a state space model

1429
01:36:40,930 --> 01:36:43,020
and the state space model here is a trend

1430
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:46,350
a locally varying trend and here's an estimate of the trend

1431
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,810
temperatures are increasing over the two-and-a-half million years

1432
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:57,300
anda twenty dimensional signal that simply a represent an empirical representation the signal is no

1433
01:36:57,860 --> 01:37:00,470
attempt to model specific components

1434
01:37:00,870 --> 01:37:03,370
at different frequencies is just an encompassing model

1435
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:05,250
and then of course measurement error

1436
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,760
this is an extraction all of components using this decomposition theory

1437
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:13,670
just three or four the components so that in terms of error

1438
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:15,700
the wavelengths coming down

1439
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:19,140
and all on the same scale so you see the relative contribution

1440
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:20,210
that they give

1441
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:22,360
after the overall data as a result

1442
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:27,350
and if you look at posterior distributions for wavelengths you'll see that they lived in

1443
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:29,370
the they cover the range is a v

1444
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,820
a thought orbital dynamic periodicities that theoretically

1445
01:37:34,490 --> 01:37:35,040
well known

1446
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:40,840
this is the data with the trend simply superimposed let's look at this picture

1447
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:46,090
what we have here is is an investigation of the wavelengths over time this is

1448
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:50,650
a time varying models so each of these is a quasiperiodic process with a time-varying

1449
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,230
well in fact they look pretty stable

1450
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:56,610
the colour-coded to correspond

1451
01:37:57,290 --> 01:37:58,260
they look pretty stable

1452
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:03,980
but at this time point and there's a faint dashed line it about one point one million years here

1453
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:07,480
there's a funny switch what happened there is that

1454
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,660
at that time point there was a

1455
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:14,460
an inversion of the dominance in terms of the estimated amplitudes between the first two components

1456
01:38:15,620 --> 01:38:17,700
this is a nice example of the use of these models

1457
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,690
that's another nice example

1458
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:28,570
and this fit in in the early nineties to the conversations that were going about changes in ice-age cycles

1459
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:34,340
and whether there were a discrete events about one point one million years ago

1460
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:36,970
in the overall dynamics

1461
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:38,280
a virus

1462
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:40,810
somehow ruptured

1463
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:44,160
these cycles and simply change the patterns that

1464
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:48,520
been evident before and you see that in these components you see

1465
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:52,070
they greater amplitude is then much less predictable

1466
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,720
after this particular time point

1467
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:57,260
whereas this component goes goes through a few

1468
01:38:58,430 --> 01:39:02,850
a few thousand years interesting behavior but becomes the dominant way wasteful there's no change

1469
01:39:03,050 --> 01:39:07,470
modeling there's no intervention modeling there's no mixture modeling it simply comes out the slowly

1470
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:08,530
varying nature

1471
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:10,610
a that parameters

1472
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:11,800
that these models

1473
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:13,850
have built inside

1474
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:18,590
second example context and this has been

1475
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:25,130
very well explored over the last several years very active area current eiji studies in other areas of the neuropsychiatry

1476
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:26,770
so here we've got

1477
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:29,450
electrical fluctuation measurements only

1478
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:34,290
on a one point on the scalp a patient undergoing treatment forever

1479
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:35,420
at about

1480
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,200
undergoing a brain seizure that's been induced on the various

1481
01:39:42,370 --> 01:39:45,730
to understand response to electroconvulsive therapy

1482
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,900
and this is a really nice example of a

1483
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:56,300
why these this particular class of models that just exemplified in thee any oxygen isotope data are a really

1484
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:57,710
very widely used

1485
01:39:58,150 --> 01:40:00,550
so in the early part of this is is very high

1486
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:02,430
amplitude fluctuations

1487
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:05,230
whatever wavelength is implied by the red one

1488
01:40:06,170 --> 01:40:10,570
and as you go through time this is your changes certainly amplitude is very variable

1489
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:12,810
and its tailing offices caesareans ends over here

1490
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,010
but you'll see

1491
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:14,860
the same

1492
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:19,300
temperature going to fit into this equation i don't see any temperature terms

1493
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:23,800
temperature must be buried in the rate constant and that's what we're going to go

1494
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:27,820
to look inside the rate constant so will increase yield

1495
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:33,620
temperature and that was known for

1496
01:40:33,670 --> 01:40:35,810
many many years but it was finally

1497
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:37,100
the swedish

1498
01:40:37,110 --> 01:40:39,600
chemist arrhenius

1499
01:40:39,650 --> 01:40:42,140
one eighteen eighty nine

1500
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:48,820
announced a relationship that bears his name when he found was that the relationship between

1501
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:55,330
the specific rate constant and temperature was exponential through an equation of this form

1502
01:40:55,340 --> 01:41:01,240
exponential of the ratio of some energy which he termed the activation energy

1503
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:07,860
divided by the product of the boltzmann constant temperature and pre exponential factor which we

1504
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:10,850
write as a in order of arrhenius

1505
01:41:10,910 --> 01:41:12,790
or in another way

1506
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:16,340
right in this manner a e to the minus

1507
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:22,280
e over cables TV so there's the relationship and another way of showing it is

1508
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:27,340
to put on a semi log plot if you plot the natural logarithm of the

1509
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:28,670
rate constant

1510
01:41:29,630 --> 01:41:31,500
the function of the reciprocal

1511
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,770
of the absolute temperature

1512
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:36,230
you'll find according to this equation

1513
01:41:36,270 --> 01:41:38,010
you should get a straight line

1514
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:44,170
one over t is increasing from left to right so high temperature is

1515
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:48,320
on the left side and they should be linear with this slope of

1516
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:51,330
i minus e eight which is the activation energy

1517
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:52,350
divided by

1518
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:56,550
the boltzmann constant and just to give you a sense of order of magnitude the

1519
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:59,520
activation energy for typical

1520
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:04,230
chemical reactions is on the order of about one electron volt which is on the

1521
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:07,370
order of about one hundred kila jules

1522
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:09,960
per mole

1523
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:15,290
so if you take this and choose an arbitrary rate for room temperature

1524
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:19,070
plug in the value of one hundred kila joules per mole which you can show

1525
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:23,130
yourself is that with this activation energy you

1526
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:25,730
o double

1527
01:42:25,790 --> 01:42:27,660
double the rate

1528
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:31,690
double the rate for every ten degrees

1529
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:36,990
rise above temperature obviously this breaks down for large

1530
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:42,060
excursions in temperature but in the vicinity of room temperature

1531
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:46,350
if you have an activation energy of typically of about one electron volt you can

1532
01:42:46,350 --> 01:42:47,740
expect to double

1533
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:49,700
for every

1534
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:53,910
ten degree so what's the physical meaning of activation energy what i try to show

1535
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:57,590
it to you in terms of a mechanical analog so

1536
01:42:57,650 --> 01:42:59,550
what going do here is show you

1537
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:03,400
what we can say is going to be used a loudspeaker

1538
01:43:04,070 --> 01:43:09,190
so loudspeaker and what i've done by putting the axon on the loudspeaker at the

1539
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:12,890
the intersection of the x will say that that's the centre of mass of the

1540
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:18,990
so speaker is now in a gravitational field and we can argue that i can

1541
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:21,290
represent this as a point

1542
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:25,090
zero dimension at this hypothesis table

1543
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:27,770
now clearly phili this on its side

1544
01:43:27,810 --> 01:43:29,790
the point has fallen

1545
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,060
so it's now to lower gravitational potential

1546
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,270
really if the box that's where the box for line side so how can the

1547
01:43:38,270 --> 01:43:39,810
box doesn't just

1548
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:44,710
following side why doesn't the box just line of sight since the decrease in energy

1549
01:43:44,710 --> 01:43:45,760
when i do that

1550
01:43:45,770 --> 01:43:48,940
you see the photo

1551
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:51,570
i will it's absorbed now

1552
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:53,390
looking to go see

1553
01:43:53,410 --> 01:43:56,470
OK so why does the box fall inside

1554
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,050
well this is the box is zero kelvin

1555
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:02,960
so now let's put the box at room temperature so what's happening at room temperature

1556
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:05,790
the boxes doing this room temperature

1557
01:44:05,790 --> 01:44:08,260
but even so the box on the side

1558
01:44:09,150 --> 01:44:13,150
because in order for the box in free space to go from the vertical upright

1559
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:17,620
and locked position to the supine position what must the box do

1560
01:44:17,690 --> 01:44:23,040
the box must first rise up on one corner

1561
01:44:23,050 --> 01:44:26,500
only one rises up on one corner gets to discuss

1562
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,230
does it have the ability to fall freely

1563
01:44:29,310 --> 01:44:34,800
so what we're looking at in terms of gravitational potential is activation so i can

1564
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:40,370
give you the same thing i could plot this as the extent of reaction

1565
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,990
extent of reaction

1566
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:49,130
and some energy relative to gravitational potential on the ordnance

1567
01:44:49,190 --> 01:44:51,830
and i got three positions here i've got the box

1568
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:56,090
in the vertical position i got the box in horizontal position and clearly

1569
01:44:56,170 --> 01:44:58,830
there's a decrease in energy right this

1570
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:03,070
this change is the delta p of the reaction

1571
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:08,630
but the box can get to the right position from the left position without first

1572
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:11,210
rising up on its side

1573
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:15,620
it must at some point rise up on its side and when it rises up

1574
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:18,820
on its side it's

1575
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:25,040
centre of mass has risen and this energy is the activation energy

1576
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:26,950
right hand side

1577
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:32,170
I just cooked it up by adding this 1 this 1

1578
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:36,600
now what's the solution with this the right answer

1579
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:41,300
the solution but there's no right hand side is clear it talks now I took

1580
01:45:41,410 --> 01:45:43,410
1 of the these

1581
01:45:43,410 --> 01:45:48,970
1 of the and none of those so so actually just changed around like this

1582
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:51,910
when I took this new right

1583
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:59,760
so that in the in the role picture I have 3 different planes

1584
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:05,970
3 3 3 new planes beating now at this point in the column picture I

1585
01:46:05,970 --> 01:46:08,950
have the same 3 columns but not all

1586
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:13,820
and combining them to produce this guy and it turned out that column 1 was

1587
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:16,760
column 2 which would be somewhere there

1588
01:46:16,910 --> 01:46:19,190
there is the right column

1589
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:26,080
1 of this and 1 and this would give me that the new

1590
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:30,170
OK so that's like we squeezed in extra examples but

1591
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:33,060
now think about all

1592
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:35,430
all right hand side

1593
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:42,750
could I get cannot solve these equations for every right-hand side

1594
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:47,780
and it can I say that that's the question so that's the algebra questions

1595
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:52,520
can I solve a x equals b for everybody

1596
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:54,230
but the write that down

1597
01:46:54,230 --> 01:46:56,280
can solve

1598
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:01,910
for every

1599
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:07,150
right hand side it up I mean is there a solution

1600
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:09,750
if there is

1601
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:14,210
elimination will give me a way to find understood I really wanted to ask is

1602
01:47:14,210 --> 01:47:15,520
there a solution

1603
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:17,670
for every right-hand side

1604
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:21,360
so now can I put that in different words

1605
01:47:21,390 --> 01:47:28,600
In this linear combination words so in linear combination words due

1606
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:35,930
linear combinations of the columns

1607
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:48,520
three-dimensional space but everybody

1608
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:53,210
means all of these in three dimensional space

1609
01:47:53,210 --> 01:48:00,340
so that that juicy that I'm just asking the same question in in different words

1610
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:05,750
solving a x 0 that's very important

1611
01:48:05,810 --> 01:48:08,650
a times X 1 and multiplier

1612
01:48:08,650 --> 01:48:12,540
and matrix by a vector

1613
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:16,890
I get a combination of the columns of the old right that

1614
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:19,210
down it in a moment

1615
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:23,690
so that it could use it but in my column picture that's really what I'm

1616
01:48:23,690 --> 01:48:28,040
doing and taking linear combinations of these 3 columns

1617
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:30,170
and I'm trying to find

1618
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:35,800
and actually the answer for this matrix will be yet

1619
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:42,150
for this matrix for this for this matrix A for these columns

1620
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:43,540
the answer is

1621
01:48:43,860 --> 01:48:45,210
of about

1622
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:49,360
up but yes but other

1623
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:55,670
this matrix is that there is this matrix that that the I shows for an

1624
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:05,520
a good matrix nonsingular matrix an invertible matrix of those would be the matrices that

1625
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,490
we like

1626
01:49:07,490 --> 01:49:09,450
there could be other

1627
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:13,210
and we will see other matrices

1628
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:15,340
where they answer becomes no

1629
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:22,580
all actually you can see when would become known of the could

1630
01:49:22,820 --> 01:49:24,690
what what could go wrong

1631
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:29,560
how could go wrong that out of these out of 3 columns

1632
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:32,100
and all their combinations

1633
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:35,390
when and when I'm not being able to produce

1634
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:39,150
the software

1635
01:49:39,170 --> 01:49:41,320
when when could go wrong

1636
01:49:41,390 --> 01:49:46,910
do you see that the combinations it's supposed to be say goes

1637
01:49:46,910 --> 01:49:53,100
if these 3 columns all why in the same plane

1638
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:55,450
then their combinations will lie

1639
01:49:55,450 --> 01:49:58,910
in that same point

1640
01:49:58,930 --> 01:50:04,650
sold then we're in trouble if the 3 columns of matrix

1641
01:50:04,670 --> 01:50:08,910
if those 3 vectors happen lie in the same plane

1642
01:50:08,930 --> 01:50:14,760
for example if column 3 is just the sum of column 1 and column 2

1643
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:17,150
I would be in trouble

1644
01:50:17,150 --> 01:50:21,150
that would be a matrix A where the answer would be no

1645
01:50:22,410 --> 01:50:25,100
the combinations

1646
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:29,560
if column 3 years in the same place this column 1 and 2 I don't

1647
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:33,150
get the know from that all the combinations of in the planes

1648
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:37,150
and the work on the right hand side is the that I could get it

1649
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:40,800
would be the ones at that point

1650
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:44,280
so what I could solve for some right-hand side

1651
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:48,210
when b is in the in the planes but most

1652
01:50:48,210 --> 01:50:52,000
right hand sides would be out of the plane and unreachable

1653
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:54,890
so that would be singular

1654
01:50:54,950 --> 01:51:00,690
matrix would be not invertible there would not be a solution for every be the

1655
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:03,210
answer would become known for them

1656
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:12,250
I don't know if it so we take just a little shot thinking about

1657
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:15,250
9 dimensions

1658
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:17,840
imagine that we have

1659
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:21,910
vectors with 9 components

1660
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:25,650
it can be hard to visualize those

1661
01:51:25,650 --> 01:51:30,800
I don't pretend to do it but somehow

1662
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:32,260
pretending to

1663
01:51:32,450 --> 01:51:38,040
that pretend we have if this was 9 equations in 9 unknowns then we would

1664
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:40,470
have columns

1665
01:51:40,490 --> 01:51:44,340
and each 1 would be a vector in 9 dimensional space and we would be

1666
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:47,670
looking at their linear combination

1667
01:51:47,730 --> 01:51:53,320
so what we really having the linear combinations of 9 vectors in high-dimensional space and

1668
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:57,650
we would be trying to find the combination that hit the correct right hand side

1669
01:51:58,470 --> 01:52:01,570
and we might also ask the questions

1670
01:52:01,580 --> 01:52:03,690
can we always do it
