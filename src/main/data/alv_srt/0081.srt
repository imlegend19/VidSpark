1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
suppose we have a couple programs

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,270
we want to computer here like that

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,200
right and to run them to take up a certain amount of memory

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,980
so if we had this type of memory the amount of memory recall and

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,330
we can run programme one

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:28,610
but we can also write

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,550
now this that tell us we run them together

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,440
might be the most of

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,580
filamin completely and that the other one or that just have to wait

10
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,670
we don't want that

11
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,160
that's what we like

12
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,390
is that

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,890
he was that why would we like

14
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,550
well that tells us we have the memory twice

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,880
we have two lots of it

16
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,150
so this sort of conjunction is staying

17
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,330
the town to talk about

18
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,300
what we can do at the same time

19
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:43,330
concurrency that sort

20
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,630
but here we are talking about formulas as representing truths about the world they represent

21
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,900
information is different from other people talk about information as a resource

22
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,120
you can use it up in the same way

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,480
i know these chairs in the room blue values that particular thing i can still

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,930
retain information about way

25
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,130
if you pay

26
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,750
his example always paying a dollar per pack of cigarettes and or a cigarette is

27
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,300
a chain smoker that and so

28
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,800
other people which it changed into a dollar for a can of coca-cola so that

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,890
there is anything but if you buy coca give away the dollar

30
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,190
i give all its own

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,940
so there's a difference between resources that give away

32
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,310
and once you down and the nice thing about linear logic is you get to

33
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,850
make that distinction

34
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,360
what we have already

35
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,660
but are

36
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,530
and we have as much of it and we went around looking like an entropy

37
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,610
information or something like

38
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,850
we write it like that

39
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,920
i mentioned before

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,810
was put after because

41
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:13,170
and that

42
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:21,980
the other sort of infinite fusion

43
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,740
of these things we have as much as we want

44
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,420
we can collect

45
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,650
what's needed linear logic

46
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,720
well if you put bangs front of all of premises you end up and you're

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,980
allowed to do that the court

48
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,340
should point you put information what's very old premises end up with intuitionist logic

49
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:53,780
let's a whole that aside from in

50
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,980
you know

51
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,360
so we can we can use that as much as we want

52
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,810
that's what that tells us

53
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:19,190
is that we can do that as much as we want and that's quite nice

54
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,180
now what is that this that this logic doesn't

55
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,580
you know neither of those things you want to be sensitive to much ahead if

56
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,090
the it those using and if you have

57
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,180
it's a

58
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,340
and you need twice to give you a you can you have you can do

59
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,320
it just with one

60
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,300
if you can do it with one

61
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,910
it might not be that you want to be able to say

62
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,120
that you could do but with two

63
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,170
right memory sure

64
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,120
but there might be other things like with what the cells and things like that

65
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,120
you want to be very sensitive to how much of the stuff you have

66
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,860
right i mean if you think about this one

67
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,840
you want to be just very sensitive to the things of contraction and weakening are

68
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,150
just that

69
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,900
those things are just completely out

70
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,280
for that

71
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,170
one is is actually quite interesting in

72
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,420
the original formulations this logic

73
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,090
we not only have implications fusion but we still have

74
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,220
and or and

75
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,330
we can get out

76
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:16,930
so from one and seven and negation elimination we get

77
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,080
well what if we want to have a so we could use this

78
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,740
right that's why we use that we start off with this and we wanted to

79
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,520
prove what we really want to prove

80
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,450
is this that's LEM

81
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,640
we want to prove is that to get to

82
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,570
and so from this so that we get a

83
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,270
we're not a

84
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,750
so it one

85
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,220
and six

86
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,690
so one through seven

87
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,990
the negation elimination two

88
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,380
non into so that's not an intuitionistic arguments we used

89
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,000
that's right here

90
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,950
assume that

91
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,950
what we could prove

92
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,480
an intuition is is this

93
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:17,260
we don't have this but we do have it's double negation

94
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,650
now that's weird thing about intuitions logic

95
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,440
if a

96
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,940
is a theorem of classical logic

97
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,520
and not not a

98
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,110
is a theorem of intuitionist logic

99
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,350
and because it wishes logic is the subsystem of classical logic

100
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,080
the other direction holds as well

101
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:46,680
you can embed classical logic within intuitionistic logic by sticking double negations in front of

102
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,210
all the parents

103
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,590
that's just plain design

104
00:07:51,790 --> 00:08:04,470
the rationale for intuitionist logic doesn't tell you that that's going to happen

105
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,920
and i have some proofs in the book if the proof of

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,860
the double negation of this is in your notes

107
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,650
that's very funny but that proved this fun

108
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,430
so you do use this at crucial point

109
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,040
and you could have just thought well i'll stop used instead of this negation introduction

110
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,630
to get that

111
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:34,840
OK so that's the relationship between classical logic intuitionistic logic they're very very close relationship

112
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:41,670
there was this debate actually by one philosopher here at the time richard sylvan and

113
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:46,350
with other people here on saying look into issues logic isn't a restriction of classical

114
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:53,590
logic is really an expansion of it because you capture all classical logic within

115
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,630
and you can write you can represent all quite yet

116
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,980
ninety two is not a rule systems are

117
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,630
well why do they reject this

118
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,950
it's because of this

119
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,820
we don't want this and why don't we want this to say if you can

120
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,670
that you cannot prove

121
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,770
if you prove can prove that you can prove something

122
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,880
then you've got it right then

123
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,350
if you can prove that you can prove that you can prove something that you

124
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,990
can have it and that means you you've gonna so

125
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,710
and that's not it we signals proves all those

126
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,320
if you put into intuitions logic but i mean s four dollars boxes see you

127
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,590
eat it

128
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,330
all user told the for class

129
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:22,620
i mean

130
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,650
that's really all you know it so

131
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,370
if you can prove

132
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,790
that's not the case

133
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,920
that you can prove that not a and a

134
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,680
it just isn't just a few you have to say that a million times yourself

135
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,110
it is a you have that same you can get that

136
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,720
this the same thing that be the other direction hold

137
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,200
for intuitionist centre for classical logicians so

138
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,350
these two are equivalent for intuitionist and that's exactly the reason they rejected the reductio

139
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,330
because they say well i

140
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,000
if i zoom is not the case

141
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,540
then i get into trouble

142
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,930
and it must be true

143
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,930
that assumes that either it's true it's not one that you think about excluded middle

144
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,590
why isn't excluded middle

145
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,740
why is that

146
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,040
OK intuitions to play

147
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,020
well you can prove something or you can prove that you can prove that

148
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,130
how do you know that

149
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,590
fermat's last theorem is gone we can prove that

150
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,060
maybe not intuitionistic labour improvement

151
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,850
but maybe

152
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,620
we can

153
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:46,920
could show that the ryman conjecture are called box conjecture whatever

154
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,520
one of these hard problems in mathematics maybe they're not

155
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,510
we can prove

156
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,480
that not provable

157
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,830
or least the negation is not provable

158
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,740
but that doesn't mean that provable cells might say

159
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,880
it's undecidable

160
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,810
i mean got inside problems if you're thinking about

161
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,830
mathematics as

162
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,330
what can be done with me implemented sometimes you just might not have you might

163
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,140
not be able to get it or its negation and so

164
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,460
the excluded middle you don't get

165
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,930
this you don't get and so on so that's that's where with the whole is

166
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:30,720
but you're right it does look off to classical minus it's very symmetrical

167
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,090
OK let's get any questions

168
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,080
OK now

169
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,750
so that's

170
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,540
intuitionistic logic

171
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,020
and with intuitionist logic we have two because you don't have these complete infinite is

172
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,870
so you have to revise mathematics very good a lot

173
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,090
calculus become something completely different

174
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,100
obviously right to talk about limits on what happens at the limit

175
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,810
i e gotta stop talking that way if an intuitionist

176
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,730
kind of you can use that one deltas and in in some

177
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,700
interesting way but

178
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,260
the construction the real numbers itself because we think of those infinite expansions of some

179
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,310
of the rationals infinite expansions

180
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,920
they have to be in some way

181
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,600
things that we can approximate

182
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,420
and that is something called free choice sequences which is often planet hard

183
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,710
i don't scare you away from that interested in doing it wishes analysis a lot

184
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:37,450
of people do work and that it is extremely interesting offline hard often means of

185
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,970
planet interesting as well

186
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,170
there are some funny bits of intuitionism as i mean classical mathematics that we have

187
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,470
to give up and one thing is this

188
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,240
we can talk about the quantifiers

189
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,830
it's one thing

190
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,740
suppose we have a function

191
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,240
at some point its values are below zero

192
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,690
at some point above zero

193
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,740
it is continuous

194
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,650
so therefore

195
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,400
and then i suppose

196
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,670
taking one attribute with the lead us to such a situation

197
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:22,090
entropy one here to visit weight in if we take another entropy attribute

198
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,420
this would lead us to

199
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,400
nine positive zero and negative seen one set zero positives five negatives in the other

200
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,260
obviously which was

201
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,070
this is more informative than this

202
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,700
this one

203
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,630
OK so and if we would go through the actual computation

204
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:50,880
we would see that for instance for each subject we basically computer the game

205
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,650
and we chose

206
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,590
there to to build with the maximum gain

207
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,820
has the highest entropy humidity

208
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,820
has slightly lower than the distal have even lower

209
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,820
attributes with the maximum gain would be selected and put into the root of the

210
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,990
then we split

211
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:23,280
the set of instances into subsets and then we repeat

212
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,590
we again shows the most informative attribute and then we stop when all the examples

213
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,490
in the leaf belong to the same class

214
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:36,530
so that's a pretty straightforward good

215
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:44,840
OK so you have more computations here

216
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,970
the formula

217
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,610
we had the computation of probability

218
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,880
the simplest way how to compute the probability is through relative frequencies

219
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,650
so we said what is the probability of class

220
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,670
we said well let us estimator it with the number of instances in the set

221
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,220
and then

222
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,150
we do

223
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,170
the relative frequencies of positive instances compared to the number of all instances in the

224
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,740
set for instance we had fourteen examples

225
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,150
the training set out of which there were nine positives

226
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,740
so this would be the

227
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,690
the root of the decision tree that

228
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,800
randomly drawn instance

229
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,630
from the center for the instances would be

230
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:44,470
the positive instance so that the simplest probability estimate the simple relative frequency and this

231
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,220
is described here

232
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,760
we could have more complicated

233
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,260
estimate of probability

234
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,380
one of them is the plus estimate which

235
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:03,490
assumes that the prior distribution of class plus and minus is uniform there is fifty

236
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:08,030
percent of examples of class plus and fifty of minus which would mean that if

237
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,110
we have no additional information

238
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,170
as it would be fifty fifty

239
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,990
why is this OK

240
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:23,780
and that would be for a binary classification problem the relative frequency estimator can be

241
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,050
modified to introduce estimate and for k

242
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:35,840
problem it is modified into this assuming the uniform distribution of k classes being uniformly

243
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,090
distributed and then there is more elaborate probability estimate which is called the name estimate

244
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,780
which takes into account the prior probability of the class

245
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:54,300
positive compared to the distribution of other classes so if i just try to intuitively

246
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,570
explain why these different estimates are

247
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,260
useful so the relative frequency is obviously the most intuitive and that that's what one

248
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:10,550
would straightforwardly use however it is unreliable with small samples suppose we have one positive

249
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:17,010
and there is just one example then we do our probability estimate would say well

250
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,030
the probability of class plus

251
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,960
is one hundred percent

252
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,470
so in order to

253
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,690
take into account the prior distribution of classes and if we know that it is

254
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:34,010
uniform we change this into the lab class estimate which means that if we have

255
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:39,320
whatever lands matrix of fine cells

256
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,590
to see if basically our strategy is our population of our best solutions sort of

257
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,850
beat around them quite

258
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,780
and LBC is basically long biased coin

259
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,730
basically we have with what we have

260
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,240
with that we're basically made one side of the coin heavy

261
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:04,850
the other side of the coin so it's acquired it's basically very likely to say

262
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,290
let's go along

263
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,130
as species short by coin which is like the other way around and what we

264
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,120
can see here

265
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,310
except for its wall except for stock of HSBC

266
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,220
for the other for invesco and glasses glaxo

267
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,790
well the twenty fifth quantile

268
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,020
the best solutions of sharpe ratio produced is actually better than

269
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,660
you know a random strategy

270
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:38,090
this basically based on the flip on flipper for quite

271
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:44,680
this is basically an example

272
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,430
a solution

273
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,310
four invesco

274
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,980
and it's basically what

275
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,170
as you can see it's

276
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,770
moving average of the past returns for for seventy seven periods

277
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:05,470
multiplied by the return at t minus thirty five and

278
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,540
some tricks

279
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,470
function that

280
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,210
i think what's most interesting about this is the one is basically the return of

281
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,940
ten by the latest which is like the best solution

282
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,580
and the red line is the buy-and-hold strategy

283
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,630
well what we see is that

284
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,140
the best solution is a solution to sort of learned

285
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,580
to get

286
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,350
to get to

287
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,310
it's not get but it's not

288
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,650
is land

289
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,000
basically get those ones right

290
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:08,790
maybe you have

291
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:14,490
you said that you will have to do

292
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,890
this is

293
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,750
one which is really really

294
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,510
so a

295
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,580
i don't know

296
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,830
well what we've done is we've

297
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,910
so to put maximum lengths which an individual can saying

298
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,500
so if with sort of put constraints on how large an individual can be

299
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:55,610
if you want to have this

300
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:02,390
so this is certainly something something that i think

301
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,290
we should look at

302
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,230
but it's

303
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,910
well similar to what sign saying you drive

304
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,960
get the ones that actually matter

305
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,920
decoding it's harder

306
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,880
and basically

307
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,110
who was doing the work on the spam has had on that for

308
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,460
over you got some positive results what does

309
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,880
complicated political process but that's

310
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,650
is it it's still kind of limited by

311
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,210
i have to say

312
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,360
you can go with all these things

313
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,730
only so far you still

314
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,280
at the end of the day after committee doing sequence models

315
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,170
you you translate phrases you don't three structures you don't have nice can generate is

316
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,780
you know pre-orders from the end to the second position that he would have an

317
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,690
so maybe

318
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,940
long range reordering

319
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:59,480
the argument this kind of thing works for many mid-range hillary has a long range

320
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,110
reordering you should really then do

321
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,590
past recent restructure

322
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,530
again being very motivated by german to english

323
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,670
because of the better handle morphology but

324
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,880
getting the first in the right place

325
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,630
we still only have crude hack parsing the source

326
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,900
having manual rules

327
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,270
having been able to learn this

328
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,980
his mission or the

329
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:45,230
yes i it's certainly true that not all answers and announcing on these things so

330
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,590
this also i mean once you get to the slow you this different ways and

331
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,750
it is things

332
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,780
two separate plural something like this

333
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,630
jennifer while the user part of speech tagger that included subject object tags

334
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,880
maybe you don't want to to have them included part of speech tags they went

335
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,920
somewhere else

336
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,300
this is

337
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,920
i mean that's all the propositions that english like five different text in which position

338
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:25,070
but then the frequent enough that we should actually use the surface of missions

339
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,900
i mean there's another

340
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,880
general sentiment about it the always sounds very plausible to say we should use syntax

341
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,710
that the next missions which syntax whose syntax which parse whose parts

342
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,940
you know phrase structure grammars dependency grammars

343
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,840
all kinds of people everybody has its own grammar

344
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,690
and and they all behave differently in there

345
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:21,110
it does have CSR we we have this trick of reordering before does have a

346
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,570
significant impact on this but just because of

347
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,500
it has all kinds of knock-off effective everything else so once you don't have to

348
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,860
work in the right place to you introduce structure it's all over the place

349
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,420
but there that's true

350
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,940
that's definitely true that you're not going to our pride is more important than getting

351
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,650
the of a

352
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,480
is small

353
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:30,230
four was

354
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:06,550
well i mean we always have the standard approach which is very narcissistic about everything

355
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,530
except you have to separate things up words which for something which is a big

356
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,170
i mean it's different i mean

357
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,750
i mean you want to do well

358
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,680
on on european languages who want to do well in spanish english which is a

359
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,590
relatively simple language care

360
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,380
one of the well on that so if the resources available we want to do

361
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,110
better than that

362
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,650
what if you don't know if you only have a couple of thousand sentences

363
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,530
parallel corpus that's the challenge

364
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:42,070
i mean develop different methods for different situations

365
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,880
we don't have to

366
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,250
make sure that bodybuild works for everything

367
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,000
this so a lot of work in low density languages and

368
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:58,610
this that the typical darker scenarios that there is a crisis in some foreign country

369
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,730
nobody ever heard of and you know

370
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:07,210
rumsfeld whatever it's called now comes and says i need energy system twenty four hours

371
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,210
we also papers so

372
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,780
so that's in our exists but

373
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,820
you know

374
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,030
in during the thing because scenarios

375
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,690
a company wants to translate the user manuals

376
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,570
well known languages

377
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,400
maybe has a lot of

378
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,080
so this is really looking at the robot really much more city member rather than

379
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,000
just a sort of device you're just interacting with on year-round really thinking about extending

380
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,020
into this larger larger of networks

381
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,190
so i'm going to show you could video this robot autom that we developed to

382
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,460
explore this question by

383
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:46,550
i'm ready to work with them to help you do your rules thanks for coming

384
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,120
i hope you had a good day so far

385
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,460
this here is the first robotic weightloss coach that we

386
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,910
building a set of these are going to go into people's homes around the boston

387
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:01,200
area so we can do a long-term study looking at two things one is looking

388
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,410
at various aspects of human robot interaction what happens when people actually have a robot

389
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,050
in their homes for a couple of months of the interacting with and also looking

390
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:13,340
to see if it is useful in this particular domain weight loss

391
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,460
it's also helpful for us if you tell me how much exercise you got today

392
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,210
what you do that now

393
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:25,370
the robot speaks to me while interacting with the various times asked me to input

394
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,850
information like how much i even today

395
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,370
and how much time

396
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:36,380
if you tell me at least one so the homoge exercise will be more likely

397
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,180
to get you to wonder what more schools

398
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,650
so you may notice a number of things about the way that this robot was

399
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:48,220
designed the first is that it has the physical embodiment and they can exhibit a

400
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,240
very simple non-verbal cues such as eye contact

401
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:56,480
and shared attention one hypothesis we had the simple cues are very important is listening

402
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,370
this sense of engagement with the human robot actually looks at you into your eyes

403
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,640
can feel much more connected and more motivated to interact with the the second thing

404
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,170
you might notice the nature of the dialogue so there's a lot of team building

405
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:12,870
dialogue and this was really motivated by looking at doctor-patient dialogues and how you build

406
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:18,070
a working alliance the robot is never pushy if never bosses never guilt-trip in new

407
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,450
but is trying to talk about if you did this is going to help us

408
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,650
achieve our goals as a lot of talk about the common goals and strategies for

409
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,070
achieving those goals

410
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,940
the relationship is the relational model of the robot goes through at the very beginning

411
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,060
of the interaction

412
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,170
the interaction tends to be the language of more formal rubber gives more explanation of

413
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:39,430
why that to do such things such as injury are waiting powers and so forth

414
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,640
as you interact with the robot longer the nature of the dalit becomes more informal

415
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:48,320
and explanations become short because there's an assumption of common ground and there's much more

416
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,800
reference things you've done in the past as well since are going to do in

417
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,730
the future and there's another state with the robot senses that the relationship is undergoing

418
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,150
disrepair if you know using as much engages in dialogue to try to re-establish relationship

419
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,840
is very interesting dialogue model and relational model that was built into this robot in

420
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:10,020
order to try to model patient-doctor sort of relationship so a fundamental question was

421
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:14,330
what about this robot with these nonverbal cues versus a putting the exact same dialog

422
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,840
and relational model just regular old computer

423
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:21,490
the same touch-screen interface is the actual robot make a difference and comparing it to

424
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,830
to traditional intervention which is basically people keeping track of the caloric intake and outtake

425
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,280
with pen and paper log

426
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,410
so we did a study design was a four-week mandatory interaction with an optional two-week

427
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,470
we built fourteen of these robots put them into people's homes in the boston area

428
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,670
we could have a lot of subjects from the boston medical weight loss clinic dr

429
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:45,570
carolyn province actually on cricket thesis committee which is very similar helping us recruit subjects

430
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,740
and so forth it just turned out that the age range happened between eighteen and

431
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,560
seventy two from the people we could agree to to the study i mean eighty

432
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,870
percent were female

433
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:56,380
the other conditions again with the computer and the people are

434
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:00,280
and the two core questions you wanted to know was

435
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,620
will people be more motivated to interact with the robot over the long term and

436
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,270
what is the state of the working alliance they feel they have a strong working

437
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:11,220
alliance with the because these are the most predictive of long-term success is important to

438
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,190
recognise that the weight loss itself is that the issue you can lose weight over

439
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,380
a number of different diets issues keeping it all so it's really the long-term engagement

440
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,640
we're trying to achieve measure in the study

441
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,890
we get a bunch data the robot of course would record all of the interactions

442
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:30,810
that very detailed look at how often you're interacting with those interactions were higher caloric

443
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:34,900
intake was going away management so forth we did not post any question

444
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:39,910
on the people on this subject after the study including administering working alliance symmetry which

445
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:44,580
is the standard psychological measure the doctors used to measure the working lives of patients

446
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,090
as well as just open and close study interviewed as the questions such as you

447
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,970
know the quality emotional interactions so for

448
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,550
and these are the kinds of questions you might look at and working life in

449
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,780
the choice of questions in terms of you feel that interact in the system you

450
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,180
could reflect more upon the process of losing weight do you feel that it was

451
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:05,430
accurate and how it helps you keep track of weight loss goals and monitor progress

452
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:11,450
did you feel that that you're able to understand the problem or yourself do you

453
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,740
feel also that the system had a working alliance with you

454
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,330
so if you look at the the results it was very interesting so it turns

455
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,290
out that if you look at just the length of interaction

456
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:24,980
alone it turns out that people chose to interact with the robot almost twice as

457
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,210
as the computer or the pen and paper interface and again and we were about

458
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,160
people were hoping for this result

459
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,120
but we were not expecting it to be the strong because again the information was

460
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,600
identical between the robot and the computer the only thing that different is the physical

461
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,710
embodiment of the computer

462
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,500
and if you look at

463
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,400
measure the working life symmetry again the robot outscored the computer and of course pending

464
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,920
paper log

465
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,120
if you look at some measures the working lives symmetry other participants reported that they

466
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,110
trusted the robot more

467
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,660
that the robot was more engaging

468
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,140
that was more reliable

469
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,770
make the network's see the kind the inputs that it would generate

470
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,420
itself during training so it knows to kind of go back to write

471
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,120
know the middle of the wrote the kinds of things that are

472
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,450
the human would do the teacher would do so

473
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,760
in other words the idea is that a instead of

474
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,030
of picking the ground truth as input

475
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,430
what we train with some probability we can pick the ground

476
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,780
truth and with some probably we can pick

477
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,260
the sample coming from the output of the model

478
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,790
and it turns out that it's actually wrong to do that from from

479
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,810
point from machine learning on view that

480
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,330
this procedure doesn't actually learn the right thing

481
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:46,170
but it's reasonable to believe i don't have any proof of that but

482
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,760
it seems reasonable that if we

483
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,410
if we make the probability of of choosing one of the other gradually

484
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,770
decrease to words zero that the sense that

485
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,370
ends up just listening to the ground-truth and

486
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:01,240
then you be ok and it would have some kind of exposure to the

487
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,550
kinds of things that kind of see equations that it would seem

488
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,510
to dries by itself

489
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,620
right so one interesting question

490
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,940
this something wrong in this you take some time to go

491
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,270
really understand that when we to think about it is

492
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,610
imagine that we we run the network in its training using ground

493
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:28,310
truth and then we let it run by itself for a few steps right so it's

494
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:31,200
what we open loop so just you know takes output and

495
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,340
as input and it might go in in a strange place

496
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,290
and in particular the place where it goes

497
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,310
might not the right answer for that as the state where it ends up

498
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,460
might not be the one that you have around to sequence so if you

499
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:51,310
go back to the driving example maybe the driver was is staying as

500
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,410
trade in the middle and if if the

501
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,590
the car decided to go bit right now the right action would be to

502
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,060
go back to the middle but maybe because the ground truth was thing

503
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,640
in the middle it says you know as you stay in the middle or even

504
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,270
go to derive because it was gone to the left so so these could

505
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,750
be inconsistent or targets that we're getting to this network

506
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,700
so so you know equation is really how should we trained as and

507
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,180
one idea i had when i wrote those slides

508
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,930
was that well we don't actually want to match the

509
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,940
the ground truth target a few steps later what we want to do

510
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,820
is to match the ground truth in distribution

511
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,780
so maybe something like gan which you will hear about and you've

512
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,630
heard a bit already about yesterday

513
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,360
might be a good way to deal with this problem

514
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,160
ok so let me talk more about some architecture variations

515
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:55,620
so up to now i haven't really looked in to how we structure the

516
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,440
architecture of the neural net but what you see

517
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,430
on the left here is sort of the the the architecture that

518
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,070
talking about we could we could think of

519
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,680
in several researchers papers have proposed different ways of making

520
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,790
this kind of architecture deeper for each timestep

521
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,880
and so you can do various ways so one the first ways was proposed

522
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,830
believe by alex graves is the one on the bottom left called stacking

523
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:27,380
where essentially we're going decompose the state into a different

524
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:30,690
levels so here we call one level the h is the other z but you

525
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,650
could imagine having many more levels

526
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,320
typically people have like ten levels like

527
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,500
normal deep nets so not that what happens is that

528
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,590
for a given input xt there will be a like a deep network feedforward

529
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,750
if you want recurrent net going up to all the state that the the

530
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:54,240
layers of the recurrent net but at each of these layers like ht for

531
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,050
example not only depends on the current input but of course and that

532
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,840
previous layer but also on the previous value of dots

533
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,880
levels state ok so that's the stacking version

534
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,670
another way that you could increased depth is to think about

535
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,560
making the transition from one state to the next state deeper instead

536
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,710
of having sing go find full by nonlinearity

537
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,790
for going from as t to s plus one you could

538
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,830
get in search like an mlp for example like the picture and middle

539
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,820
and similarly the mapping between states

540
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,360
and outputs could be deeper right so you could again search one

541
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:35,890
more hidden layers now there's a problem with this that

542
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,450
i should put the as i here doesn't for so we had a paper about

543
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,820
this as an issue when winning in search

544
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,380
when you insert an extra layer from t to t plus one

545
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,870
is that it it it somehow extra any more difficult because

546
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:58,310
the length of the sequences to be considered is not like doubled

547
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,680
and so we we inserted little skip connections here that goes directly

548
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:08,330
from my to t as well as the in addition to the extraordinary extra

549
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,200
layer in between

550
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,020
that's going to to the problem of long term dependencies which i'll

551
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,570
come to f if you minutes you can also

552
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:23,860
in my half lebanese mothers served in arabic lamb dish is the centerpiece every special occasion

553
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,840
so what would happen if i rejected the traditions that bonded me to my family

554
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,450
what i didn't realise back then was there

555
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,160
although change is always somewhat scary

556
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,890
and although changing ingrained behaviors is always somewhat challenging

557
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:46,070
the change would also be tremendously in power

558
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,510
i didn't realize that would be

559
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,840
healthy here today

560
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,950
forty five was and always half my age twenty two

561
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:55,430
and a half

562
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:01,430
i didn't realize that i will be able to cook and eat even more abundantly

563
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:11,510
and i didn't realize that the deepest bonds with others are forced not through unquestioningly following the dictates the tradition

564
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:18,410
could by becoming the kind of person who practices authenticity and integrity of the court

565
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,490
systems and dation have meaningful relationships

566
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,570
john f kennedy once said that belief in this allows the comfort opinion

567
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,180
without the discomfort a thought

568
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,430
james kay did not underestimate the power of minutes

569
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,200
anthony should we

570
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,720
because the mean me prevail despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary

571
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:50,220
and they prevailed largely because the system is so entrenched

572
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,740
when the system is entrenched that means that embraced and maintained by all major social

573
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,620
institutions from the family to the state that it's become

574
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:07,760
has expressed in this quote from a nineteenth century french political economist

575
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,410
can you see magazine

576
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,990
when plunder becomes a way of life for men and women living together in society

577
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:26,640
they create for themselves a course the time in the course of time a legal system that authorizes it

578
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,570
and a moral code

579
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,090
that glorifies the

580
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:42,590
and when we are born into an entrenched system such as carnism we inevitably absorbed systems logic around

581
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,590
in other words we internalize

582
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,760
carnism we were able to

583
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,680
look at the world through the lens of carnism

584
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:57,430
and criticism uses a set up defenses that distort our perceptions of meat and the

585
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:01,300
animals we eat so we can feel comfortable enough to consume them

586
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,640
for instance carnism teaches us to see animals objects

587
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,260
so that we refer to this turkey

588
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,430
rather than someone

589
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,490
are we call this little baby

590
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:18,860
and it's

591
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,110
thank you

592
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,030
rather than here she

593
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:32,450
criticism teaches us animal has abstractions as lacking in individuality and personality of their own

594
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:38,470
and then simply as abstract members of the general group about which we made

595
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,800
and generalized assumptions a pig is a pig

596
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,640
and all things are the same

597
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,300
like another victim

598
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,110
the violent ideologies we give them numbers rather than names

599
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:57,010
this is summed up by a meat cutter who i interviewed before my doctoral dissertation who said to me

600
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:02,300
i don't think of farmed animals individuals i wouldn't be able to do my job

601
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,760
if i got personal with them

602
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:11,240
when you say individuals union is unique person has unique thing with its own name its own characteristics you

603
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,620
yeah i'd really rather not know about

604
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,120
i'm sure it has

605
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,430
but i'd rather not it

606
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,860
end carnism and teaches us place animals in rigid categories in our minds that we

607
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:33,010
can harbour very different feelings and carry out very different behaviors toward different species

608
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,490
for example

609
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:39,950
a female meters were interviewed told me that she regularly consumes

610
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,700
pour me et cetera et cetera and when i asked her if she

611
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,300
feel she stopped

612
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,720
and she looked at me with an offended expression

613
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,450
and she answer well let's just say i came to your house and you told

614
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,760
me that i had just eaten real

615
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,820
i probably bombing

616
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,610
what i have to get out of my system

617
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,930
and when i asked her why she said

618
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,360
because deal comes from a baby

619
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,930
and i can intervene e

620
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:16,950
and when we look at the world through the lens and partners and we fail

621
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:22,970
to see the absurdities other systems so we see images like this or like this

622
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:27,140
someone mutilating their own body so that they can be

623
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,720
and we take no notice

624
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,680
rather than take offense

625
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,680
all we see images like this

626
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:36,610
more this and we

627
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,700
rather than cry

628
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,200
volterra was right

629
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:47,340
if we believe absurdities we shall commit

630
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:52,050
stopping is as our said it's like belly any cos you've got gotten

631
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,330
rid of to hyperparameters potentially three

632
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,060
if you were going to choose you know regulation constant

633
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:03,180
so yeah is more convenient compute nationally also

634
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,530
a right

635
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,980
and is not yet it is nine tally zero yeah

636
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:04,100
so those commun thing that perhaps there might be overfitting

637
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:06,280
on the validation set if it's too small

638
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,780
i think i haven't even address and i'm hoping to

639
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,460
yeah what is the choice for the training validation set split that's

640
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:19,030
i can give you some numbers but like the core on it

641
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,660
tends to be know like and this often it's ten thousand four validation

642
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,460
set and fifty thousand fortraining

643
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,790
but for a very small dataset it's early stopping is a little bit

644
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,320
annoying with respect to that

645
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:47,370
yeah yeah yeah

646
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,210
how many times you evaluate

647
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,970
yeah one last question yes yeah

648
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,470
well eventually so the question is whether these curves will continue

649
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:46,000
if you've you know if you reach zero error

650
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,430
you should have zero gradients so learning anymore

651
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,560
so then this curve should stop you know moving

652
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,710
so beyond that's as you reach you know as you get closer and closer

653
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,490
to perfect performance as you would tend to expect validation set

654
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:06,830
curve to increase i don't we frankly don't have like i got the

655
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,880
perfect intuition for what happens after you reach this point

656
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,460
because you tend to ignore all you care about his

657
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,830
evi gone beyond this point and after that

658
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,470
things happen don't with the care but

659
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:23,300
i would that joe expectation is that yes this would continue increasing

660
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,580
you can see that like that there's not a

661
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:33,690
like you know i wouldn't be concerns a i on experimented increase

662
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,840
the but it stayed somewhat flat that's you know not silly bug anything

663
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:41,560
like that all right so moving on

664
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,630
a few other things to know about when training neural nets

665
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,220
so i think that you should definitely do if you have a real

666
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:55,230
valued data so inputs x where the dimensions are continuous

667
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:58,890
use deafening normalize your data that is subtract

668
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:02,440
the training set mean for each dimensions computing the mean for

669
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,610
each dimension separately and subtracting

670
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,310
dividing each dimension by the training set standard deviation is

671
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:14,370
also a good thing and it's been shown to often speed up training

672
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,430
in terms of the number of epochs required for convergence for

673
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,490
reaching that over underfitting or fitting point

674
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,640
yes so what

675
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:31,210
yes you don't do that if you data binary yes that's for reeled

676
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,470
valued so non banner binary or multinomial data

677
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:40,740
the rest of

678
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:53,570
yes so so for for binary observations essentially this scale

679
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:57,610
is going to be i mean this scale like zero to one is just like

680
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:01,960
you know it's not a numerically stable scale

681
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,920
i guess is the best way could describe it

682
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,160
so that is imperfectly that's we can define

683
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:16,160
that's one thing the other thing is decaying learning rates

684
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,650
so far but i just that's the s gradient descent

685
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,850
have assumed i describe it as using a constant learning rate but

686
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:25,890
you can do better and this i'm sloops very

687
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:31,360
quickly mention a few ways of no more sophisticated optimization

688
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,010
and we're going to think of the

689
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:38,380
sort of dividing the

690
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:43,030
the probability of being misled among these functions with a distribution q

691
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,100
where we're sort of allowing

692
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,350
dividing the delta if you like among

693
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:57,590
these functions with each function f fn getting assigned q and fraction of delta

694
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,730
where we assume that the sum of the q ends is less than or equal

695
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,190
to one

696
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:06,070
and then we can do

697
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,660
what is known as the union bound

698
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,560
by applying that

699
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,500
previous results

700
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:15,440
for each

701
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:22,290
individually and bounding its probability is being less than qn delta

702
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:26,500
and therefore the if we just sum up the probabilities of all of these any

703
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,180
of these misleading as we get because the sum of the q and was one

704
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,490
we get delta

705
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:35,740
so in other words the likelihood that any of the mislead us

706
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:40,310
in other words there exists an offence for which it has zero training error but

707
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:43,510
it's error is bigger than the corresponding apps along

708
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,060
which is

709
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:49,470
what i computed as one n log one n qn delta

710
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,060
that was just the

711
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,470
this quantity here

712
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:54,330
with t

713
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:57,950
substituted for by qn delta

714
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:00,310
here so the

715
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,680
the probability that any of these

716
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,700
he e

717
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,080
it is

718
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,020
doesn't hold is less or equal to delta

719
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,310
so i mean if you're the union bound is a simple idea but

720
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:14,330
it's just basically

721
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,310
if you think of the space of

722
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,490
samples that you might generate

723
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:23,140
there's little region where

724
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,600
function one might

725
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,700
mislead us

726
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:30,870
there's another region where function to might mislead us and this has size q one

727
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,560
delta size two delta

728
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,870
they might of course overlap in q three delta might overlap

729
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:39,310
and so on

730
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:43,200
but if the sum of all of these assuming they don't overlap is less than

731
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,580
delta then certainly if they do overlap is going to be less

732
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,600
so that's just the basis of the union bound very simple idea

733
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:54,330
and so we get the

734
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,760
the result

735
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:00,990
so this doesn't take into account any connections between the functions this is assuming that

736
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:03,890
in some way no relationship between them at all

737
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:07,220
and clearly that's a weakness of this bound

738
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,810
but we can turn it around and we get our first theorem

739
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:16,890
so all of these say we when we do that the analysis you want to

740
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:21,240
think of it in bounding the probability of being misled but this doesn't really read

741
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,140
very well to a practitioner of machine learning so you have to sort of turn

742
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:32,180
it around and turn it into a statement about the generalisation performance so we do

743
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,600
that by just saying OK

744
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:40,330
that was the probability of being misled so with probability one minus that

745
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:47,280
content of that that we were misled so with probability at least one minus delta

746
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:52,040
over the random m samples the generalisation error of a function f and

747
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:56,930
there is this nice relation it has zero training error than its true error is

748
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:59,310
bounded by this quantity

749
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,390
now was we were misled by any functions so any function has zero training error

750
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:06,600
as this band

751
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:13,260
so this is a first learning theory has a very sort of standard formerly or

752
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,120
learning theory statistical learning theory bounds have something of that shape to them

753
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,060
typically one n

754
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:23,810
they typically have a log one delta buried in there somewhere

755
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:29,560
that's a nice feature because it means that the size of the sample you need

756
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,180
in order to sort of

757
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:37,010
up your confidence about the result is very benign in other words you know you

758
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:41,010
can sort of of delta or multiply delta by

759
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,280
one of the in you only have to add one extra example so you kind

760
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,620
in a very nice sort of

761
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,620
the nine situation as far as dependent on delta is concerned

762
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:58,310
now the depend the other term here log one on q and is something

763
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:03,330
you can think of is the complexity of the function fn that we're interested in

764
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:05,790
measured in some sort of

765
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:10,330
bits or even its or whatever

766
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:15,510
in the way that the distribution but we chose qn determined so we of going

767
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:19,560
to choose q and we can think of this in a bayesian senses the prior

768
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,780
over functions

769
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:26,850
the we're thinking that they're more likely functions were going to give higher IQ in

770
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:30,370
and going to suffer therefore better bound here

771
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:35,620
but the ones that are less likely QM will be larger and we may be

772
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,040
in the worst situation

773
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:41,080
as far as the spam but still log one on q and so again it's

774
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,010
quite a benign

775
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:48,260
entry so we can think about is the sort of complexity or description length of

776
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,430
the function fn

777
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:57,580
notice that we have to define a function qn before we see the data we

778
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,870
can't cheat

779
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:06,660
if we did have a distribution that we knew that was the distribution governing the

780
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:12,640
likelihood of different functions then the expected generalisation error will be best if we choose

781
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,740
q equal to p

782
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,450
that sort of the bayesian

783
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:20,890
and indeed this sort of is if you like the starting point of the PAC

784
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:23,990
bayes analysis of the relationship between

785
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,810
a bayesian prior

786
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,120
and so on

787
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:36,910
so mean you

788
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,560
i could

789
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:43,490
the mass of the sun

790
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:48,590
same idea

791
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,260
if you take

792
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:52,390
you should off

793
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,440
you make it

794
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:55,850
you make it dark

795
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:57,370
you dormitory

796
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,760
and in front of the mirror

797
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:08,110
the amazing experience

798
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:10,770
now we have to do it for you because but i told you i really

799
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:13,630
where cotton doesn't work was cotton so well

800
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,130
we really have to do this in ireland and when you take the nylon true

801
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,640
not only do you cracking

802
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:25,180
to actually see the glow of these teeny-weeny little sparks

803
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:29,060
you actually i like it like that is an experiment that you

804
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,410
i cannot miss

805
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:32,790
and i would suggest you try that

806
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,790
this weekend

807
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:41,460
do it was a friend that even more

808
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:47,130
we all perhaps remember when you just walk around

809
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,880
you normal things during the day

810
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:51,750
the roads in rooms and you

811
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,150
i want to leave the room when you touch the doorknob

812
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,380
you get a shock

813
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,680
this spark that flies over

814
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,360
the electricity

815
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:03,410
even when you touch to person

816
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,240
sometimes if few

817
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:09,110
this so

818
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:10,530
there you go

819
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:14,100
and your picture and read all these roles the then stuff

820
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,550
just doesn't want to come off because as you roelof

821
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:21,080
there friction and gets charged and often get scrambled up

822
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,960
it's very bad very difficult to handle

823
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,290
the whole experience that

824
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:32,280
boxes with chocolate the same thing happens as you take it off

825
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:38,800
your charges whether you like it or not

826
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:39,660
i know

827
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:42,150
i want to do an experiment

828
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:46,560
need volunteer and in school who actually is wearing

829
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,850
preferably not all cotton

830
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,340
i think simon you have a beautiful wonderful

831
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:55,320
parker so if you

832
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:59,090
willing to sacrifice a little bit for the sake of science

833
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,910
and come over here

834
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:08,320
and sit down here

835
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,350
just relax

836
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:12,910
make sure that your feet off the ground

837
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:22,110
so i'm going to do now simon going to be q was kept for

838
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,670
and that i dq is kaffir for

839
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:30,460
you get charged

840
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:36,450
since i don't want you to be the only person who suffers under these experiments

841
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:40,270
were also stand on an insulated stool

842
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:43,740
so if you become for instance positively charged so i don't know what it is

843
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:48,360
positive or negative i will get the amount of charge so we share

844
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:50,700
in the charge

845
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:54,910
and that i dq

846
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,750
you will charge up more and more

847
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:02,310
and i will charge of more and more

848
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,310
and then

849
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,860
we will have to convince the class

850
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,480
that that we are both charged

851
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,090
and we will do that

852
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:16,750
in a way that will be hopefully rather

853
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:26,780
and we just start beating you little bit

854
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:30,350
to make you feel at home we know each other right

855
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,850
OK now of course as i mentioned to you

856
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:35,950
these experiments were well when it is dry

857
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,910
if you have to wet it won't work

858
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,930
but let's see you sweat a little bit too much then it doesn't work too

859
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:46,490
we're ready

860
01:00:46,530 --> 01:01:02,010
i have here in my

861
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:05,330
and a neon flash two

862
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:08,520
and although we don't know yet what voltages

863
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:11,070
because we learn about that in this course

864
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:16,500
to get good flesh out of these you need about a few thousand votes

865
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,110
so we'll see

866
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:21,520
will make it dark shortly

867
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:24,600
and i hold the flashlight the flesh

868
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,110
flight in one hand

869
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,850
the neon discharge tube and then simon will touch it

870
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,730
on the other side

871
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:35,500
and if we succeeded

872
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,400
you may see some light

873
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:41,850
simon look at the first don't touch it yet because we're going to make it

874
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:42,920
all the way dark

875
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,570
you know it's there

876
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:47,550
OK make it darker marcos that's it

877
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:50,730
but it

878
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,280
OK i tried again touch it again

879
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:54,890
OK thank you

880
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,260
we have some light

881
01:01:56,270 --> 01:02:08,560
thank you very much

882
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:14,150
equal charges repel each other

883
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:15,350
i show that

884
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:19,890
the demonstration was the balloons

885
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,500
here we have an instrument this is called event graph

886
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,840
it's named after professor van der graaf who invented it was an MIT professor

887
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:30,330
and this instruments

888
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:31,770
which i will not discuss

889
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:33,810
in any detail about

890
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,900
but you will understand it later on in the course

891
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,290
i tell you all about it later

892
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:43,850
think this instrument as the super amber wrong

893
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:45,650
and although we don't know yet what

894
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:50,590
i mentioned already the twenty thousand fold between

895
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:57,750
in this installment you have to think in terms of several hundred thousand four

896
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:01,960
the history of the world has have

897
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:04,870
because you're population is the whole world

898
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:08,790
now you omit the information from the eight i can let you look at the

899
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,680
this are the sex column

900
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:14,370
i think this and you find out that they make from

901
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:18,310
there are a lot of men and women

902
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:22,060
and then maybe you will not just to predict and say OK i have a

903
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:27,390
little bit better off if i come along being among because it's more exceptional

904
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:29,540
if it so this is

905
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,580
pierre predictor in the

906
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:36,940
those you that said are you look at several of attributes

907
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,080
before making your

908
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,980
of course nobody would play the same

909
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:47,690
you want to see everything of the observation before making the prediction

910
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:51,850
so if you see all the values for all non class at

911
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:53,810
then you can conditions

912
01:03:53,810 --> 01:04:00,330
history of the if it's separation of black hair and blue eyes and it turns

913
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:05,830
out that this subpopulation includes many of the women and very few of the men

914
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:10,560
all them i may switch my predictions

915
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:15,850
so what you are predicting the maximum a posteriori is predicting the value of the

916
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,290
that makes as high as possible

917
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:23,640
the conditional probability

918
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,500
indigenous to the observation that you have about

919
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,790
look at what values you have

920
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:33,680
check your ladyship you find that for people with this

921
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:36,040
over observations with centrifuge

922
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:40,790
classes are split in this way and the largest one

923
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,250
is the one that has

924
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:47,210
i would higher reliability or may be much higher depending on the number of members

925
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:52,180
this is due a predict the maximum a posteriori it is not necessarily the one

926
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,870
you choose maybe you would

927
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:59,230
sure some other machine or you know there are other options

928
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:00,540
but this is one

929
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,710
it is an excellent predictor

930
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:04,540
if you can use

931
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:08,620
but you will not be able to

932
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:14,230
assume that we have article should we have for our usage

933
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:14,870
this is

934
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,910
this is nothing really

935
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,060
not useful values this is nothing

936
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:24,100
still you count how many conditional probabilities and its

937
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:26,370
the the twenty

938
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,730
because the neighbor memory among

939
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:30,420
but it was part of it

940
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,920
you need to estimate all the probability

941
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:34,810
and with

942
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:39,850
how many of the original you need to estimate the parameters of fuel

943
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:44,330
and each observation only contributes to one

944
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:47,190
twenty two to twenty

945
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:52,540
items just to make sure that you have also been used one candidate

946
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,850
and we find candidate don't estimate the probability you have only a handful of them

947
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:01,140
i mean any sense if insufficient but at the end of definitely if you don't

948
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:05,310
have enough already

949
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:09,140
not going to argue you will never have so many

950
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:13,660
in the last thing that i will show you

951
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,410
maximum posterior is doing a

952
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:21,310
yesterday of course which

953
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:23,080
and i will ask you

954
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:26,000
where i am today what do we know that

955
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,790
naive bayes

956
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:33,350
assumes independence

957
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:36,710
it is one way

958
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:40,480
assume that

959
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:45,160
so first let's take this quantity the compost it this way my bayes is that

960
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:46,850
they are not you john

961
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:52,060
in the same game using a

962
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:56,140
and now you observe that for all values of c which are the different values

963
01:06:56,140 --> 01:07:01,880
i said well

964
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:21,100
all time

965
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,530
you can

966
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,600
there are

967
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:28,290
to do this

968
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,450
if you know

969
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,200
they something

970
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:08,810
if you

971
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:19,550
because are in you

972
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,020
in one

973
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:38,840
that's so

974
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,580
not you

975
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:04,290
now i have

976
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:38,250
the problem

977
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:42,030
you get

978
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:00,850
now in the

979
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:08,610
also you

980
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:14,580
he it is now

981
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,270
if you not

982
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:41,880
he was also

983
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,630
a lot of c

984
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:14,070
so much for

985
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:16,360
so there not

986
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:22,490
world of particles

987
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:41,630
you are

988
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:52,620
you we need

989
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,110
it is

990
01:12:58,410 --> 01:13:01,520
is a

991
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:02,960
i'm sorry

992
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:13,190
here's to

993
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:11,070
and we use

994
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:22,190
i mean

995
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:23,380
as you

996
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:34,150
and when

997
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:36,420
so year

998
01:15:57,410 --> 01:16:04,670
well that's right

999
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:13,240
for very

1000
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:21,200
it's a small

1001
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,550
all right

1002
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:42,570
thank you

1003
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:49,850
it will

1004
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:58,790
this is where

1005
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:04,130
no o

1006
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:22,280
all these that very

1007
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:30,050
and on

1008
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:41,480
one two

1009
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:45,550
it's not

1010
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:47,290
on the

1011
01:17:57,550 --> 01:17:59,440
he was

1012
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:16,720
can use the structure

1013
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:36,370
you know

1014
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:40,050
but pressure

1015
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,830
OK now

1016
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:01,970
he sits on the board of

1017
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:42,840
it is

1018
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:05,790
all o

1019
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,310
the goal

1020
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:37,520
what's next

1021
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:42,450
three or

1022
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:02,080
i mean

1023
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:05,020
world we really

1024
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:09,890
all four

1025
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,580
the pressure

1026
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:29,470
you know

1027
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:38,530
you read

1028
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:44,050
so the

1029
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,830
one of

1030
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:53,390
let's use it

1031
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:57,300
in fact you

1032
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:00,320
the lego motor will lead will turn this

1033
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,300
relative to the attachment

1034
01:22:03,230 --> 01:22:04,730
that's the robot kids

1035
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,850
so you they wrote of robot will be able to do this

1036
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:15,930
and the robot will have eyes these are photosensors photo resistors actually

1037
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,500
so the idea is going to be that there is information available in those sensors

1038
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:24,620
for figuring out where light is so that you could track at

1039
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:27,860
your job will be

1040
01:22:28,430 --> 01:22:30,180
to build a circuit that's the thing

1041
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:36,550
the connects via cables these red gables in yellow cables connected by a cable to

1042
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:38,010
this head will give you the head

1043
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:41,630
your job will be to make the circuit

1044
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:43,520
that's converts

1045
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:48,160
signal from the photo resistor which is in proportion to light

1046
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:52,740
and figures out how to turn the motor

1047
01:22:53,150 --> 01:22:54,280
to get ahead

1048
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:55,700
interface the light

1049
01:22:56,670 --> 01:23:01,820
and then shipped out information down to the robot to let the robot turn its wheels together body

1050
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,290
so it's kinda like

1051
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:07,150
the light comes on right over here the were looks at is yes reality

1052
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:13,990
so that's the idea in the third module is to incorporate new sensing capabilities into the robot

1053
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:18,210
the final module is on probability and planning

1054
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:20,170
and the idea here

1055
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:21,370
is to

1056
01:23:21,950 --> 01:23:23,420
one about how you make

1057
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:27,950
there are robust to uncertainty

1058
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:30,580
and they can

1059
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,140
can implement complicated plans

1060
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:38,710
that they are robust uncertainty

1061
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,300
so there's a number of things that we will do including

1062
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:46,090
creating maps of spaces that the robot doesn't understand

1063
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:49,160
telling the figuring out telling the robot howto

1064
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:50,780
localize itself how

1065
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,030
how is it woke up suddenly in an environment could figure out where it is

1066
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:57,030
how to make a plan

1067
01:23:58,740 --> 01:23:59,700
and as an example

1068
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:01,280
i'll show you

1069
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:03,910
the kind of system that we will construct

1070
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,600
here the idea is that we have a robot the robot knows where it is

1071
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:13,460
imagine that the jeeps and the reason but imagine there's a the robot knows where

1072
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:16,000
it is and knows where it wants to go that's the star

1073
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:20,660
but has no idea what kind of signals are in the way

1074
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,370
so you know if you were a robotic driver in boston

1075
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:26,080
you know

1076
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,710
that you started out at home and you will end up in a mighty

1077
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:31,810
but there's is annoying obstacle you know the old people

1078
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,950
that's used should in principle these things that you know

1079
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,440
data that's that's kinda the idea of

1080
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:41,900
so he so

1081
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:47,760
i know where i am on the robot i don't worry about nor were being summarized information here

1082
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:49,750
where i am is purple

1083
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:51,460
where i wanna be is golden

1084
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:53,920
i have a plan

1085
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:55,470
that's blue

1086
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:00,100
my plan is very simple i don't know anything about anything other than i mean

1087
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:02,610
i mean what famine i wanna go good cambridge

1088
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,380
so you know blast

1089
01:25:08,330 --> 01:25:11,150
so i imagine that the best way to do there's a straight line

1090
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:14,980
okay so now what i'm going to do

1091
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,850
turn on the robot and the cart in the robot has now made one step

1092
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:23,970
and i told you before about these sonar sensors

1093
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:26,880
from the sonar sensors the robots learn now

1094
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,440
but there seems to be something reflecting

1095
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,650
and each of these black dots

1096
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:37,920
he got a reflection from the black dots from me from these sonar sensors that

1097
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,060
means it's probably a wall there are person or something that in principle i should

1098
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:45,610
in the red dots represent

1099
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,350
the obstacles so close i really can't get here

1100
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:53,600
so i'm excluded from the red spots because i'm too big

1101
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:58,080
the black box the black spots seem to be an obvious obstacle

1102
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:01,270
the red spot seem to be where i can't get

1103
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:05,170
i still wanna go from from where i am purple

1104
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,850
two hour i wanna be golden so what i do is i compute a new play

1105
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:11,770
okay then

1106
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:16,030
i started taking a step along the plan and as i'm stopping along

1107
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:21,000
okay so now i think that i can go from where i started over here

1108
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,070
i have to go around this wall that i didn't know about initially

1109
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:29,560
so not just are driving it looks like right i'm getting married

1110
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:35,240
right and i know i go straight down here mean there's another ball game what i do now

1111
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,490
so the robot goes around long

1112
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:46,380
it didn't know when it started what kinds of obstacles that would encountered that has its driving it around

1113
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:48,670
but i didn't work and start over

1114
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:52,570
so the idea is

1115
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:54,940
this robot

1116
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:58,990
is executing any very complicated plan

1117
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:03,880
the player and has in fact many some plans

1118
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:09,880
and the sub-plan all involve uncertainty you didn't know where the walls were when it started

1119
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:17,400
and when it's all done is going to have figured out where the walls work and provided us away

1120
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:21,810
presumably find a way to negotiate the maze and get to be

1121
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:23,440
to be a destination

1122
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:25,590
so the idea then

1123
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:32,130
if you would have if you were asked to write a conventional kind of program

1124
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:37,870
for solving that's it might be kind of hard because the number of contingencies involved

1125
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:44,160
what we will do is break down the problem and figure out simple and elegant ways

1126
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,160
to deal not only with uncertainty but how do you make complex plans

1127
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:53,410
so as i said

1128
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:57,060
primary pedagogy is going to be like this

1129
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:01,590
and so the ramolefi is

1130
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,610
it how the course is organized

1131
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:07,940
you can introduce herself and something about your background

1132
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:14,700
sure thanks kevin lynch chief software architect adobe was chief software architect that media which

1133
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:20,310
combines adobe about two years ago and and i've been writing software for about twenty

1134
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:23,230
seven years now and

1135
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:29,010
and i was early macintosh developer when the mackinnon eighty four hours writing software for

1136
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:36,040
creating adventure games three d graphics package and publishing software and since i worked on

1137
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:40,470
things like three maker frame actually also got acquired by the i did the macintosh

1138
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:45,110
version from maker with two other the gas and that i was the general magic

1139
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:48,070
for about five years old ten handheld communicators

1140
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:54,500
before people really wanted to have them was around ninety two and then i went

1141
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:59,250
to mecca media ninety six so seven there are now eleven years and just had

1142
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,550
a great time there we have worked on

1143
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:05,750
dreamweaver got to build the team built dreamweaver

1144
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:10,850
which is a great honour and pleasure to do that is an excellent two and

1145
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:14,750
the dreamweaver name by the way is the code name that i made up and

1146
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,340
we working on the project would it mean to be the product name but then

1147
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:21,700
we can think of a better name and so the shipping history river and then

1148
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:28,890
flash was actually created by two guys jonathan gain robert roberts had to me and

1149
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:33,220
and they built the runtime and the tools just the two of them and they

1150
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:35,680
didn't have any q eighteen or

1151
01:29:35,710 --> 01:29:39,230
managers or anything like that so when required

1152
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:41,210
that technology american media

1153
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:45,550
so i started working on it and that was in ninety seven and so

1154
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:49,010
since then i've been working with the flash team over the past decade to really

1155
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:56,240
grow flash being and is usually just animation runtime that should cartoons to really

1156
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:01,550
become an application runtime has a virtual machine and the scripting engine and is able

1157
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:05,540
to run rich internet applications you know as well as you can still do not

1158
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:09,170
animations in two and most recently

1159
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:14,130
for the past five years i've been working on this project that's called air and

1160
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:18,140
air is about to come out early next year and this is the time for

1161
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:23,670
web applications to run on your desktop outside the browser so you you don't have

1162
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:27,750
to have the constraints of browsers web that you can access local machines resources you

1163
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:32,760
can raise notifications application can appear in the start menu or the dock was ten

1164
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:34,360
hours and i can't latex

1165
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:39,870
and your apps can run consistently across OS is this is really exciting projects it's

1166
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:42,690
been kind of the holy grail the software industry to try to make one of

1167
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:48,070
these runtimes that actually does work reliably across operating systems and people have tried to

1168
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:48,720
do that before

1169
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:56,280
java came closest to that i really couldn't get reliable runtime that were consistently and

1170
01:30:56,280 --> 01:31:00,030
so with air though i believe that we are on track to do it were

1171
01:31:00,030 --> 01:31:03,050
using technologies that already work across the web so

1172
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:07,780
the flash player already is reliable across operating systems html of course is using the

1173
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:12,540
webkit open source engine and then the PDF works across OS is and so we're

1174
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:17,950
using formats already work words deploying them for new purpose now and

1175
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:21,940
so that's been really exciting project for the past five years or so

1176
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:25,800
that's what i've been up to almost three decades of soft

1177
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:31,640
these two hack your memories first hacker approach yes i still program i may care

1178
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:35,970
applications of which actually is really exciting so it's kind of brings back the energy

1179
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:39,670
of the early days of computing when you could just as an individual available application

1180
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:45,850
and do really quickly and your friends now you traditional application development it's pretty hard

1181
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:48,840
to build applications that use these big tools takes a long time to develop the

1182
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:54,690
application there's many thousands of is you've got no but with web development it's got

1183
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:58,050
really exciting and now you can build these things really fast so the pace of

1184
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:02,970
development increased again it's this revolution in software development web software so you i do

1185
01:32:02,970 --> 01:32:05,950
that my early work i was

1186
01:32:05,970 --> 01:32:08,720
my first computer was a digital PDP eleven

1187
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:10,970
seven seventy and

1188
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:15,730
and we was first allowed only to use the the line printer the terminal wrote

1189
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:21,760
a paper and then i was able to use this year t while and

1190
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:26,870
the first couple programs are actually were on hollerith cards realities and number two pencil

1191
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:31,660
and color in the boxes and then you get the stack of cards and they

1192
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:36,880
run it and you get results back so i got beyond having to just use

1193
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:41,300
the cards by making friends with the math with the math teachers and they let

1194
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:45,380
get the computer directly

1195
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:49,840
but i was one of the things that we did we are all trying to

1196
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:55,230
hack each other stuff basically and so we used to play this game called core

1197
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:58,130
worse which was a very good thing to be doing but we basically try to

1198
01:32:58,130 --> 01:33:02,180
freeze everybody out of using the computer lab who could survive the longest using the

1199
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:09,390
the the the machine you by reducing each other's quotas and things like that and

1200
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:13,280
there's also the stack with the the line printer which actually printed entire lines that

1201
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:16,720
once you know that you know see around anymore but it sort of kind of

1202
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:21,190
painting the page with the head and actually had aligned with the page on one

1203
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:26,580
life to published content it is called line printer and go plan plan plan the

1204
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:29,010
page would be shooting up and so on

1205
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:32,100
i wrote this program ones that i try to see if i can make the

1206
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:37,340
paper hit the ceiling computer and just by sending line feeds really fast the printer

1207
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:41,700
and sure enough you can you can do so

1208
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:46,020
anyway we typed into we go that

1209
01:33:47,090 --> 01:33:48,880
past research

1210
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:50,220
we had no results

1211
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:53,350
we could also yahoo plus

1212
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:59,000
and we got out of you who research so what is i don't standing as

1213
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,780
far as research is concerned

1214
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:04,700
as long as you mentioned your

1215
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:10,580
almost dream team with jim that's a really good question so do has been very

1216
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:16,960
focused on delivering software to people being very pragmatic about that in that committee before

1217
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,360
something i really enjoying the about being w right now is that there is a

1218
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:26,230
research team adobe their publishing very much right now and i think we should be

1219
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:30,890
publishing more but we do have a team of researchers and are led by

1220
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:32,600
a fellow named thomas bligh

1221
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:38,280
and tom leads which called adobe technology labs and we do research primarily in the

1222
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:43,900
area of graphics right now and recently there are some technology that we been working

1223
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:50,450
on about splicing panning scenes together and you can place for example static photos together

1224
01:34:50,450 --> 01:35:00,840
this the same

1225
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:38,360
you really don't

1226
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:30,010
for you read you can

1227
01:36:30,030 --> 01:36:38,380
you you you

1228
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:43,430
so far

1229
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:54,970
on the other

1230
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:55,930
you know what we use

1231
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:44,820
you try your

1232
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:23,400
the main hall

1233
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:26,710
but it's particularly relevant for this sort of measure

1234
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:29,550
one is reliability

1235
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:35,640
there's not a measurement error

1236
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:40,830
and one crude way to think about reliability is a test is reliable

1237
01:40:40,850 --> 01:40:43,200
if you test the same person

1238
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:46,970
at different times and you get the same result

1239
01:40:46,990 --> 01:40:51,480
my bathroom scale reliable if whenever i stand on it gives me more or less

1240
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:55,930
the same number it's not reliable if it's off by ten pounds

1241
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:57,800
in the course of the day

1242
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:02,330
if i give you a personality test now

1243
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:05,320
and it says that you're anxious and defensive

1244
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:09,790
wall and then give it to you tomorrow and associate common minded

1245
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,680
it's not a reliable test

1246
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:14,450
so while trust over time

1247
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:16,750
validity is something different

1248
01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:19,250
validity is

1249
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:24,340
is that your test measures what it's supposed to measure

1250
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:27,600
so we really need to sort of a good test forget about how reliable it

1251
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:32,230
is does it tap what you're interested in so for example suppose i determine your

1252
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:36,490
by the date of your birth

1253
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:40,050
i figured out what they are born and i have a theory that from that

1254
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:41,590
predicts how smart you are

1255
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,150
that's my and intelligence has to date of birth

1256
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:49,940
maybe people born in january the dumbest people born in december smartness

1257
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:51,800
is that

1258
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:55,570
i was born on christmas eve is that

1259
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:58,020
is that a reliable test yes

1260
01:41:58,030 --> 01:42:02,910
it's a wonderfully reliable tensile test you today architecture tomorrow at test next year tested

1261
01:42:02,910 --> 01:42:03,900
today you die

1262
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:06,070
i get the same IQ score

1263
01:42:06,090 --> 01:42:10,080
is it a valid test it's the joke is apple not valid test it has

1264
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:14,570
nothing to do with intelligence but you notice these are two different things

1265
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:17,320
somebody can be reliable but not valid

1266
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,660
on and something can be valid

1267
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,200
and not reliable

1268
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:25,240
there are no shortage of personality tests

1269
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:29,180
you can get them all over the place

1270
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:31,670
including on the web

1271
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,460
so i took one recently

1272
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:37,410
i took i took which superhero or

1273
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:39,540
a series of questions

1274
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:41,900
i determining what superhero you are

1275
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:45,450
you could take this yourself if you want to

1276
01:42:45,470 --> 01:42:50,040
the same web page by the way offers you testing whether you're hot or not

1277
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:52,860
most of us that later on when i did this

1278
01:42:52,970 --> 01:42:55,910
told me i was batman

1279
01:42:57,550 --> 01:43:01,470
good article of gadgets and about to help innocent not suffer the pain you have

1280
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:06,010
now to be honest though

1281
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:10,180
it is neither reliable nor valid when i first the test they came up as

1282
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:11,500
the incredible hulk

1283
01:43:11,970 --> 01:43:15,470
i don't change my answers have been was wonder woman

1284
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:16,740
and finally

1285
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:22,100
finally out of frustration i carefully tailored my answer so i be batman but the

1286
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:24,300
fact that i can do that

1287
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:30,830
well raises questions about about but the reliability of this measure and its validity

1288
01:43:31,190 --> 01:43:33,980
here's an example of a real world example

1289
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,330
this is in black and white format

1290
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:38,420
version of the war shock

1291
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:42,760
test there were shocked inkblot test how many people have heard

1292
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:44,780
of the shock test

1293
01:43:45,490 --> 01:43:52,140
is there anybody here is actually in any sort of situation taken a rorschach test

1294
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:58,380
some people scattered taken up it was originally used only for psychiatric cases but then

1295
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:01,190
became extremely common

1296
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:05,610
about eighty percent of clinical psychologists claim to use it

1297
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:07,670
and most graduate programs

1298
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:10,060
american psychological association

1299
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:13,380
who are accredited teacher

1300
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:15,270
catholic seminaries

1301
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:16,410
he was it

1302
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:18,800
for people who want to join the seminary

1303
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:23,250
it was invented by a guy named hermann our rorschach shock

1304
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:26,240
he devoted his entire life

1305
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:30,640
the inkblot test his nickname when he was a teenager

1306
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:33,120
i'm not kidding you was imply

1307
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:36,540
and the idea is

1308
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:41,620
by looking at the what's and and seeing what somebody says you a great insights

1309
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:46,400
into the nature of their personality into on what they are

1310
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:49,150
hundred and twenty degrees

1311
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,880
this is my look number three

1312
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:54,970
so each one of those

1313
01:44:55,010 --> 01:44:59,110
well given the math that has this shape but they are offset now

1314
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:02,850
in phase five hundred twenty degrees

1315
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:06,430
so sort all rotating in exactly the same way

1316
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:09,020
like so

1317
01:45:09,090 --> 01:45:11,180
so the second one

1318
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:13,540
i will give me enough

1319
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:15,730
if five

1320
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:17,740
right to estimate that roughly

1321
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:22,050
something like this

1322
01:45:22,180 --> 01:45:24,840
this is the number two

1323
01:45:25,190 --> 01:45:26,970
later in time

1324
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:30,050
number three

1325
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,410
i will again be

1326
01:45:35,530 --> 01:45:39,290
look like this

1327
01:45:39,310 --> 01:45:41,450
number three

1328
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:43,560
well we we call these three

1329
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:47,500
face current

1330
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:50,250
and a three-phase current

1331
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:53,780
can produce a rotating magnetic field

1332
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,970
we will make one for you

1333
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:59,780
the first explain to you how it works

1334
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:03,280
so if the period of number of only sixty words

1335
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:06,900
and the period of number two was also sixty hertz number three is also six

1336
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:09,860
but there's also that

1337
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:10,920
in terms of

1338
01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:19,020
suppose you're looking down on a horizontal table this is horizontal table

1339
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:22,190
and i have here

1340
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:25,950
so no it

1341
01:46:25,950 --> 01:46:28,040
this is one and the same sort of nodes

1342
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:29,980
when the current ones

1343
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:34,210
clockwise you also want to run clockwise there

1344
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:36,190
but is open you

1345
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:38,160
we put something in there

1346
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:39,700
we call this number one

1347
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:44,610
but i have another one which is

1348
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:50,180
physically rotating on the twenty degrees

1349
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:53,780
it's here

1350
01:46:56,590 --> 01:47:00,040
and i'm going to feed current number two for those called later

1351
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:03,280
those courses and number two

1352
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:05,370
and never third one

1353
01:47:05,410 --> 01:47:07,110
i'm going to run

1354
01:47:07,130 --> 01:47:09,240
number three

1355
01:47:14,710 --> 01:47:16,130
the corals

1356
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:18,540
number three

1357
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:21,220
so one sees current number one

1358
01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:28,690
two three car number two in three seasons current number three

1359
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:30,520
at the moment

1360
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:34,110
that the current through number one reaches a maximum

1361
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:35,170
the current

1362
01:47:35,170 --> 01:47:36,700
in two and three

1363
01:47:36,710 --> 01:47:39,650
down by a factor of two you can check that form

1364
01:47:42,670 --> 01:47:44,010
during my lecture

1365
01:47:44,020 --> 01:47:47,920
i went a little bit too fast over the part that is coming up now

1366
01:47:47,930 --> 01:47:54,830
so i'm going to redo it a little slower to make it more clear

1367
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:56,210
when the current through

1368
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:58,920
reaches a maximum

1369
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:02,230
let's say then that the magnetic field due to loop one

1370
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:04,420
it's is in this direction

1371
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:07,450
the current through this one

1372
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:09,440
and the current through this loop

1373
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:12,290
two times smaller

1374
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:13,760
you may want to check that

1375
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:16,710
but it just so happens that the vectorial some

1376
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:19,210
of the magnetic field produced by

1377
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:20,270
number two

1378
01:48:20,290 --> 01:48:22,260
and by look number three

1379
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:26,380
also happened to be in this direction so the net magnetic field is in this

1380
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:29,660
let's now look

1381
01:48:31,190 --> 01:48:34,160
third of the period later in time

1382
01:48:34,990 --> 01:48:38,840
the current in the loop number two reaches a maximum

1383
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:40,760
so its magnetic field

1384
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:41,590
is now

1385
01:48:41,610 --> 01:48:43,460
in this direction

1386
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:45,040
you guessed it of course

1387
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:49,180
it just so happens that the vectorial some

1388
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:52,060
of the magnetic field produced by the other two loops

1389
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:54,530
is now also in this direction

1390
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:58,490
and if we now look again one third of period later

1391
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:02,590
when the current through loop number three reaches a maximum

1392
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:04,480
then the magnetic fields

1393
01:49:04,490 --> 01:49:06,280
will be in this direction

1394
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:11,510
the victory of some of the magnetic field of the other two loops will also

1395
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:13,530
be in this direction

1396
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:15,870
and look now what has happened

1397
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,270
in one

1398
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:18,660
complete period

1399
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:22,350
the magnetic field started out like this

1400
01:49:22,370 --> 01:49:25,350
one third of the period later it was like this

1401
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:29,070
and one third of the period later it was like this

1402
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:34,060
so what we have created is now rotating magnetic fields and it rotates

1403
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,460
in one

1404
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:41,560
all the way around three hundred sixty degrees

1405
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:47,520
OK let's not go back to my original lecture

1406
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,710
rotates once around

1407
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,020
in the period

1408
01:49:51,050 --> 01:49:55,150
of your alternating current that is sixty hertz current

1409
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:57,080
then it will rotate around

1410
01:49:57,190 --> 01:50:01,000
sixty or sixty times per second

1411
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,650
so if we put a

1412
01:50:02,730 --> 01:50:04,930
magnet in here

1413
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:06,600
these magnets rule

1414
01:50:06,660 --> 01:50:10,020
i want to go around when want to follow this

1415
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:12,620
rotating magnetic field

1416
01:50:12,630 --> 01:50:14,270
and we call that

1417
01:50:14,290 --> 01:50:16,530
synchronous motor

1418
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:20,520
so the rotor of such a synchronous motor itself will be a magnet

1419
01:50:20,570 --> 01:50:22,300
and it would rotate around

1420
01:50:22,350 --> 01:50:27,130
with the frequency of the alternating current which you need a three-phase current for that

1421
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:33,160
so the magnetic field rotates

1422
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:35,290
i can also place

1423
01:50:35,310 --> 01:50:36,260
in here

1424
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:38,850
this is again a horizontal surface

1425
01:50:39,790 --> 01:50:41,660
going to do it right here

1426
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:42,560
he was that

1427
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:45,450
was crazy look with three-phase current

1428
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:47,740
we can also put in here

1429
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:53,430
conducting sphere or in my case i will use conducting ag

1430
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:57,020
when the magnetic field rotates around

1431
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:58,940
is a continuous

1432
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:01,540
magnetic flux change

1433
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,770
the surface of that

1434
01:51:04,850 --> 01:51:06,160
i feel eg

1435
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:07,360
and so

1436
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:11,400
going to run could any currents

1437
01:51:11,450 --> 01:51:15,760
seven any current going around the magnetic field

1438
01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:20,300
then the magnetic field in the every current will cause the talk on the current

1439
01:51:20,370 --> 01:51:21,540
similar way

1440
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:25,320
when we discussed earlier the idea of a motor that you're going to build

1441
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:30,710
linear regression on this new know that may be a linear function to the of

1442
01:51:30,830 --> 01:51:31,820
more less

1443
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,630
that's a line which is not a very good fit to data

1444
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:39,150
on you around there doesn't have to decide whether the features users maybe you want

1445
01:51:39,150 --> 01:51:40,930
to toss the quadratic function

1446
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:45,960
but this is required right here so maybe you want to model this is new

1447
01:51:45,970 --> 01:51:51,240
x six square plus maybe some function of vector something that is around the features

1448
01:51:51,580 --> 01:51:56,150
on and off the wall you can probably come also features the model is OK

1449
01:51:56,150 --> 01:51:58,270
but open album that

1450
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:00,690
you can use without needing to do that

1451
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:14,900
now suppose you want to evaluate

1452
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:19,590
hypothesis h at a certain point

1453
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:25,660
thirteen creep points located at let's say

1454
01:52:25,670 --> 01:52:29,150
you want to know you want to know what the predictive value of y at

1455
01:52:29,150 --> 01:52:33,170
this at this position x

1456
01:52:33,180 --> 01:52:37,180
so for linear regression

1457
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:44,770
what we were doing was one thing to minimize

1458
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:50,710
summarize why i wanted to

1459
01:52:56,470 --> 01:53:04,730
and returned it has also OK so that was the new regression

1460
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:09,560
in contrast locally weighted linear regression and things slightly different

1461
01:53:09,610 --> 01:53:12,670
going to look at this point x

1462
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:16,810
and then i'm going to look at my data set and take into account

1463
01:53:16,830 --> 01:53:18,970
only the data points that are

1464
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:21,810
so in all of the city of x

1465
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:24,690
so we look at you know when i went to valley my hypothesis is going

1466
01:53:24,690 --> 01:53:28,670
to look only in the in the vicinity of

1467
01:53:28,690 --> 01:53:31,920
the point this point where one to evaluate the hypothesis

1468
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:34,860
and then i'm going to take

1469
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:37,730
this is just a few points

1470
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:39,640
and i will on

1471
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:41,210
apply linear regression

1472
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:44,560
to further streamline just to the subset of the data

1473
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:48,140
using this up term subset what was about

1474
01:53:48,190 --> 01:53:52,550
so i think there's this edit i think straight line you get a straight line

1475
01:53:52,550 --> 01:53:54,930
like that

1476
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:57,390
and what do is that

1477
01:53:57,480 --> 01:54:01,620
validate this particular value straight line

1478
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:06,960
that will be the value of it well it that this this would be the

1479
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:08,700
predictive value

1480
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:10,320
four around

1481
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:15,280
this will be the value the my hypothesis OK

1482
01:54:15,290 --> 01:54:17,270
nokia way to regression

1483
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:28,350
we can therefore no longer had form formalized

1484
01:54:28,370 --> 01:54:31,710
loki was regression because

1485
01:54:34,230 --> 01:54:39,960
on some of our i

1486
01:54:46,010 --> 01:54:47,360
to minimize that

1487
01:54:47,370 --> 01:54:54,490
where these terms study superstring i are called way

1488
01:54:56,130 --> 01:55:00,100
and there are many possible choice always adjust the right one down to e to

1489
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:03,140
the minus the

1490
01:55:07,770 --> 01:55:13,760
so let's look at what these weights really are so notice that on suppose you

1491
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:15,950
have a training example five

1492
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:21,730
so there exi is very close to the small right

1493
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:25,390
then on

1494
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:31,240
maximizing the small civic zero then this is e to the minus zero

1495
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:34,290
it is zero is this one

1496
01:55:34,290 --> 01:55:41,600
so excise close to x then w i will be close to one another was

1497
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:45,500
the weight associated the i th training example because one

1498
01:55:45,530 --> 01:55:48,230
if x i x are closely

1499
01:55:48,250 --> 01:55:51,970
conversely if the timeline

1500
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:54,240
it's like

1501
01:56:01,650 --> 01:56:05,890
an award of the ivy

1502
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:09,400
the first zero right

1503
01:56:09,450 --> 01:56:10,310
this is

1504
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:15,070
if excise very far from and this is e to the minus some large number

1505
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:18,240
and needs to mine is a large number of course is here

1506
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:27,430
so the picture is

1507
01:56:31,940 --> 01:56:35,360
at a certain point x showing the exact cost

1508
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:39,250
and my data set

1509
01:56:39,330 --> 01:56:42,140
you see the that

1510
01:56:42,150 --> 01:56:47,030
then i'm going to give the points close to this large weights give the points

1511
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:49,540
far away a small way

1512
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,780
and so

1513
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:58,160
for the points that are far away w i will be close to zero

1514
01:56:58,180 --> 01:57:02,660
so it as if the points are far away on

1515
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:07,990
they were not contribute much all the summation things is some over i of one

1516
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:14,080
times square drive in terms of course by points play zero times square always point

1517
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:18,560
so the effect of using this weighting is that the way to the russian

1518
01:57:18,610 --> 01:57:25,190
it's the same attractor state paying much more attention to fitting the points close by

1519
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:28,360
accuracy whereas for ignoring the contributions

1520
01:57:29,060 --> 01:57:30,950
so far away

1521
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:40,880
c so it turns out there are many other weighting functions you can use on

1522
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:45,230
it turns out that there are different in different communities of researchers tend to

1523
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:50,650
choose different choices by all on there is there is a somewhat of literature on
